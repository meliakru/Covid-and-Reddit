Anxiety,My Uber driver had a panic attack mid-ride. Here's what happened.,"It was early afternoon and I had summoned an Uber driver from my home to take me to a friends house to watch some basketball about 25-30 minutes away.

He arrives, greetings were fine, asked me how my day was, standard stuff. Not much talking between us, and honestly I don't mind. Car was clean as well!

&#x200B;

About 20 minutes into our drive I notice he's sort of glancing in the rearview at me like he wants to say something, he starts kind of breathing deep breaths and says: ""Sorry I have to pull over."" I reply: ""Ok is everything alright?."" He says ""Sorry having a panic attack.""

I remained calm and told him, ""Ok that's fine man, I have panic attacks too, I'm not going anywhere important, take your time.""

Luckily he was able to pullover, we were in a residential area with a hill next to us and side walk.

He wasn't really speaking much at this point and I told him: ""I know when I have these attacks I like to be alone, don't worry I'm not in a hurry, I'll be over here on the curb playing games on my phone take your time, let me know if you want to call anyone.""

&#x200B;

About 20-30 minutes later, I told him I could drive him the rest of the way so he could finish his trip and make money, he said to give him a few more minutes. He was able to calm down enough to drive us. We arrived fine, I tipped him told him this is my number if he needs to talk with someone with anxiety as well and went on our ways. I think fresh air and giving him space helped him instead of worrying about finishing his trip with me. Anyways just a small story I had today. Cheers",The way you responded to that situation was absolutely beautiful.,4927,119,2021-04-29 06:00:00,n0y195
Anxiety,Do you ever stay up late cause it’s your time to just exist?,"If I go to sleep then the next day is gonna come so much faster, but if I stay up late I can just exist and not have to deal with the world and I can just be in my little bubble. I don’t have to live, I can just exist, just be. Everything is quiet and calm and I have no responsibilities and nothing that I HAVE to do besides exist. The next day will come by so fast if I sleep and I’ll miss out on this moment of nothingness, and I’m just not ready to deal with the next day yet, I just need a few more hours of just being.",“Revenge bedtime procrastination.” A new name for an old practice. ;),4178,167,2021-11-30 03:44:38,r5dver
Anxiety,"It's so frustrating when society wants to be all ""mental health awareness"" but when it comes to the actual symptoms of anxiety and other mental illnesses or being slightly low functioning, you're suddenly condemned for showing them","The company that I worked for: ""Hey it's mental health week! Here is a pdf on how to treat people with kindness and always be mindful of others and what they might go through!""

The same company after mental health week: ""Oh what? You're overwhelmed with stress and you're showing side effects of the workload you're carrying while panicking and taking a breather? Meet me at the office after work because this behaviour is unacceptable and unprofessional compared to your neurotypical co-workers that can carry the job normally.""

EDIT: holy shit, didn't expect this to get 2k+ upvotes in less than a day. Thanks guys for the rewards, I don't know how reddit rewards work but thanks!

I feel less alone when it comes to this subject but at the same time it's sad and upsetting to know that this problem is everywhere and the mental health when it comes to society has a loooooooong way till it's normalised like a physical illness. Sending my support to you guys and I hope the world can eventually treat you better without being gaslit <3","I think a lot of people just don't understand what anxiety/depression actually looks like and get overwhelmed when faced with it. I try not to blame them because it's something society doesn't talk about much and can be a lot. 

When someone exhibits ""normal"" levels of stress/worry/sadness it's easy to alleviate that person's pain with support and kind words and encouragement. Plus, there's usually a light at the end of the tunnel, an end point. Someone saying they are having anxiety over a presentation at work presents it and then the stress is done. That's what a lot of people think anxiety means both because we use that word flippantly and because its what people talk about when referring to ""anxiety"". (Please know I'm not saying these people don't have anxiety or can't feel overwhelmed, I am not gatekeeping the term, just that it's harmful when we use that term in only one way). 

Then here comes someone who says they are having anxiety and are in the bathroom for an hour, having trouble breathing, can't eat, can't get out of bed. And people are like whoa whoa whoa, this isn't anxiety, this has got to be some way worse mental health issue! Especially if it keeps happening!

I guess what I'm trying to say in a very long winded way is that we have turned the words 'anxiety' and 'depression' into meaning 'stressed' and 'sad'. People can deal with those emotions, there's a definitive end to those feelings. Most don't know what to do with someone having prolonged anxiety attacks. Which is why we need to more openly discuss mental health so more of us can be informed.",2912,67,2021-05-07 14:10:26,n6ze4c
Anxiety,You have survived 100% of the panic attacks you’ve ever had. You’re doing damn good! Keep pushing :),,"Thank you. I get them all the time, still trying to recover from one last night..

Anxiety,I took a blanket and a hot water bottle out to a homeless man sleeping under the stairs on my apartment building. I'm shaking and feel faint but am proud I did it.,"It's about 2 degrees Celsius at night where I live right now, for context. As I arrived home late this evening I saw a homeless man sleeping under some building insulation fabric in the outdoor stairwell of my apartment building. 

As soon as I got inside my nice toasty apartment I couldn't stop thinking about how the poor guy must be freezing. I couldn't help but feel such an aching sadness that so many people just would walk past, not doing anything because of their discomfort, just like the discomfort I was feeling. I decided fuck it, show this guy the care and common decency you would want if you were in a similar situation. I found a spare blanket I had, nice and fuzzy and warm, and a hot water bottle I don't use and filled it up with hot boiled water. I was shaking so hard at this point and almost chickened out. 

Barely getting my key in the door to unlock my deadbolt as I was shaking so much, I forced myself to walk outside to him with the blanket and hot water bottle. I apologised for disturbing him, and simply said he must be freezing and to keep both items. He told me I was a gem, and thanked me.

Im back inside my apartment now, feeling like I'm about to faint from the adrenalin and starting to cry from the stress of the situation, but I am so proud of myself. I conquered the anxiety today in favour of my gut feeling and desire to act on my belief of kindness to all.

I feel I'm making a big deal out of literally just being a decent human, but it was a big deal for me and my anxiety so I wanted to share the success.",Proud of you,2328,92,2021-07-15 14:20:29,okttam
Anxiety,Anyone feels like they live more in their head than in real life?,"So, I was wondering, anyone feel like this? 
I think I spend more time in my one head than in the real life. I constantly fantasise and I take refuge in books and TV shows. 
I'm very emphatic too, and I usually imagen how is does the characters feels. 
Don’t get me wrong, I know what is real life and what isn’t. But I took comfort in imaginary worlds and usually overindulge in this feelings and worlds. 

I feel like life is extremely unpleasant more of the time. When I was younger this could had been seen as ""daydreaming"" but I’m almost 22 years old now… and I don’t know if this is still a good thing.

Edit: Hey! I'm so so happy for all the support in the comments. I just wanted to say thank you to you all! This has been quite emotional for me, being able to see myself in others and the similar things we all live trough. Thank you all for being so amazing!",I’m 28 and am still like this.

Anxiety,Does anyone get restless on their day off because they know they have to go to work the next day?,,"Always! I used to get irritatable, or upset if I hadn't done anything worthwhile. I still get a bit restless on Sunday evening, but I try and focus on mentally preparing myself for the next day. 

I might usually scan through my emails before I sleep (I don't really recommend this, but it helps me size up what my day might look like)",2199,98,2021-04-11 19:44:34,moxt7t
Anxiety,Always afraid of 'getting in trouble' - anyone else?,"I've always been nervous about 'getting in trouble' - I'm not sure I can even put words to it exactly.  As a kid it made sense, I had super strict parents, but it's followed me into my adult life.  Like at work, I'm always anxious I'm going to get 'in trouble'.  

And when I self talk that it doesn't even make sense - like who gives a fuck?  Losing my job would suck but I've never lost a job and my boss says I'm doing well.  And yet I find myself always looking over my shoulder and feeling guilt and anxiety building if anything is going wrong or if I slack off a bit after getting work done.

I wish I could shake the tendency but I just can't seem to.  Anyone else feel this?",Yes I constantly think I’m doing a bad job even if I’m told I’m doing a good job. I imagine my boss considering firing me and it makes me anxious. I overanalyze every interaction we have. It’s so stressful!,2151,150,2021-02-04 17:06:15,lcke3m
Anxiety,"Does anyone else get anxious after interacting with people, because you felt maybe you acted weird/said something wrong","I have this really annoying habit that every time I hang out with friends / have talks with people, afterwards i start obsessing over every word that came out of my mouth. ""Maybe i shouldn't have said that"" ""Maybe i should have reacted differently""... It's so tiring and it always lasts at least the next day and makes me incredibly anxious. I just want to relax and not feel like I'm a total idiot by just interacting with others. I try to constantly fight it by telling myself i did nothing wrong, but the moment i don't fight it, i get back on the anxiety circle.

I definitely have anxiety over everything reopening. I obviously want to live life in the real world again but have a ton of anxiety over re-acclimating to all of my triggers IRL. Presenting at work, interactions that I find inexplicably embarrassing, eye contact with people on the street, getting recognized by people I know, etc.",1922,111,2021-02-08 02:13:54,lf1n4h
Anxiety,"anyone else get nervous before EVERYTHING including fun things, rather than getting excited?","and it's not clear why you're nervous, it's not like a ""I'm nervous about this"" it's more of a ""i'm just nervous""","This is actually how I know I've had anxiety since childhood. When I was a kid, I would get so excited the night before/morning of an event (sometimes as small as a trip to the park) that I would get violently physically ill. I ruined a lot of my own birthday parties this way because my parents would need to cancel because I was so sick. I would start off with physical illness, then I'd start to get really upset (now I know these were panic attacks) and cry. 

Even as an adult I have this problem from time to time. Now I am able to calm myself down, but as a kid it was a complete nightmare. I'm sorry you have to deal with this.",1896,85,2021-07-05 12:15:43,oe663e
Anxiety,"Something my therapist told me that may help someone: ""Mental illness laughs in the face of logic and reason. Please don't torture yourself because your anxiety is off the charts over something 'stupid' or for no reason at all. That's just how your brain works right now. It is OKAY. We can fix it.""","I struggle hard with CBT precisely because a lot of the techniques seem to focus on helping me realize my anxiety is illogical - it's like no Shit Sherlock, I knew that. Sometimes you've just got to give yourself a little grace. Your brain is working its ass off trying to protect you in a world full of 'threats'. Life is hard for an anxious brain.","The jury is still out on if she *can* fix it and on the usefulness of CBT for me, at least for my GAD - but every now and then something she says brings comfort. Medication has been a lifesaver, therapy is more like ""nice to have"" - very useful for panic disorder and trich, so far pretty useless for GAD so in a way it's a net neutral.",1843,28,2021-01-28 04:38:17,l6o4gf

Anxiety,"I had a panic attack while driving, pulled over off the road to stay safe, and someone hit me at full speed while texting and driving. My car was totaled.","I've been diagnosed with GAD and have had a few pretty bad panic attacks in my life. Last night I was driving from my old apartment to my first house I just bought with the last load of my house plants (I had about 35 in the car, it's a hobby of mine).

For some reason I'm still unsure of, I started having a panic attack. My heart rate went up, the pit of my stomach dropped, I felt woozy, broke out in cold sweat, and felt extremely anxious. Right before going onto the highway, I pulled to the side off the road with my hazards on to give myself time to come down off of this panic attack. I called my partner, who was at the house, and told him I was having a panic attack and he  worked with me to help me get grounded and calm. 

I ended the call after about 8 minutes and told him I would call him back when I felt good to drive again. The intensity of the attack was coming in waves at this point, but it was gradually lessening. Less than 2 minutes after the call ended, someone rammed full speed into the back of my car. My car was lurched forward with an awful crunch, plant dirt and debris flew every where, I was thrown forward but my seat belt caught me. I was OFF the road to the side with my hazards on, this guy had to have somehow swerved and not seen my car to have hit me. 

I had no immediate injuries, but I was terrified. I've never heard myself scream like that. The panic attack I had almost gotten under control was now replaced with absolute mayhem of fear and pure adrenaline. The guy came out of his car and approached mine, I was already on the phone with police. He kept trying to give me his license and saying he was going to give me his insurance info. I was sobbing and telling him to wait I'm on the phone with the police. He handed me his license, so I took a picture of it while trying to describe to the location to the 911 operator. He took his license and drove off without getting his insurance. He spoke not great English and I think he was terrified and didn't know what to do. 

The police came with an ambulance. They took my vitals. I had no pain in my neck, back, stomach, or any where. I told the police what happened and showed them the pic of this guy's license. They were like ""WTF this guy gave you his license but not his insurance and drove off?"" That is a hit and run felony. I think the guy was trying to do the right thing but got scared and fled. The police caught him in about 30 mins. Turns out a car with a lot of front damage can't get very far.

My car was totaled, the back wheel was completely torn off and the back axel was twisted beyond repair. Many of my house plant's pots had shattered immediately. I had to leave half of them in the car as it got taken to an impound lot because there wasn't enough room in my friend's car who came and picked me up. I loved this car so much, it saved my fucking life. I was beside myself seeing it being towed away, broken beyond repair, with some of my beautiful house plants still in it. 

I am fully covered for by insurance so they will be paying me out for the value of my car. I will be able to go to the impound lot to get the remainder of my plants and belongings. 

What just strikes me as so fucking cruel was that I had a panic attack and chose to safely move off the road to not put myself or other drivers in danger, and I still got hit and my car was totaled. 

I'm so grateful to still be alive and not in tjr hospital. But I'm scared about what this means for me and my anxiety moving forward. Will I have PTSD from this? Will I be scared of driving/cars moving forward?","I do not know how you will feel and experience the after effects of this. I'm not sure if my advice will help you. Sometimes I feel overwhelmed by the thought of how myself, my loved ones, and my dog could be injured while I am driving them around. And then I go for a few short drives to a nearby drivethrough to help normalise it in my head again.

This part I'm not sure will help, but it helps me. Tragedies can occur at any moment whether you're in a car or not. They provide such great quality of life, I'm willing to risk the danger of driving. I'm not willing to risk the danger of not driving. I can drive people to the hospital. I can drive people to school and work, and greatly improve the quality of their life.

I remind myself that cars are designed to be struck. You could have been a walking pedestrian when that car went off the road, but you were in your car. You were in the safest place you could possibly be. Your car did a good job. I'm so thankful that your car was there for you.

Your experience sounds like a really scary one. I would be quite shaken up for a while. When you get a car again, I would make your first drive to a fun place. Maybe a nearby garden centre? And you can try to look forward to it in the meantime.",1741,77,2021-04-30 12:19:38,n1smxe

Anxiety,My therapist gave me some information that was a game changer.,"It was another day at therapy. Going thru the motions and questions, feeling like I was making now progress and pretty much wasting my time down a dead end road. I was telling her how much I hate to pick up phone calls, hate doctors appointments, hate social gatherings, etc. She asked me why I hated them. And for me, it’s just plain uncomfortable. My mind goes to: who’s thinking this about me? why is this person calling me? Why do I have to do more bloodwork? If I don’t put myself in those situations, I don’t have to worry about all those things. 

She says, that’s good! You’re beginning to see the root problem is discomfort. Comfort is something we naturally seek. It’s built in our DNA. BUT! Comfort all the time has a price. Just like too much of anything; coffee, sugar, working out, alcohol. You’ve trained your mind to view discomfort as an enemy. The feeling of discomfort isn’t necessarily a bad thing. In some cases it can be, but in some cases it’s the process of growth. It’s like growing pains. Sure you feel achey but your body is in the process of moving to something better. It’s completely fine to feel discomfort when you start to actually pick up the phone, actually go out and get an oil change, or putting yourself out there to your friends. But the more you do it, the more you’ll realize you can do. And the less it will be in the form of discomfort. Give yourself room to fail sometimes but by all means continue forward. 

It took me a few weeks to think about and process this information until I decided to be brave enough to try. And I have to say, I’m glad I did. Just like she said, I began to see I COULD. And it’s been a game changer. Hope this helps someone else!",Wow that is a game changer. I’ve been treating discomfort as the enemy because I didn’t like it (duh) but the growing pain makes a lot of sense. Growing as a person comes with a cost. Discomfort is a big issue with a good chunk of my anxiety. Thank you for sharing!! I have some thinking to do.,1598,56,2021-04-16 16:26:08,ms6sy6
Anxiety,Omg…. Do you cringe at yourself for oversharing in the moment? I do it like a compulsion I’m obsessed with feeling understood and afraid of feeling judged,"People can actually develop an opinion of me and thoughts about me when I’m not around and develop their own opinions and perceptions around outside of how I think of myself.

Fuck does that ever make you anxiety just sitting there?

I sit back and reflect. I’m embarrassed. I feel so vulnerable. I have social anxiety. 

Venting and need hugs and support

I’m scared of feeling judged after the fact.","i have spent way too much time thinking about the terribly awkward and socially anxious moments in my life where i’ve over shared to people i don’t know that well, or just said generally weird/cringey stuff without reading the room, and it definitely sucks to think what those people might have been thinking of me in the moment, but i try and think of it like this: how often do i, myself, remember awkward or overly personal things acquaintances might have said to me one time two years ago? basically never, so i would imagine those things probably disappear from the memory of the people you’re worried about judging you, just as fast as it disappears from ours. idk, i hope this helps, ive struggled with these feelings a lot in the past but i’m learning to be less hard on myself!",1590,49,2021-06-23 04:58:40,o65y8h
Anxiety,Please start exercising,"I’ve had absolutely crippling anxiety for the past 2 years. I would end up in the ER, sometimes 2, 3, even 4 times a week because of intense panic attacks. I would have seizure like activity and the doctors thought I was having seizures when I was coming in or I had a brain bleed. It was horrible.

But recently I’ve started working out. I walk for an hour at about 3.5 MPH (brisk pace) and lift weights for about 30/40 mins. Sometimes I’ll skip lifting certain days if I’m too sore or skip walking if my shins hurt too much and use that day to self care and R.I.C.E. to avoid injury. 

When I tell you I’m a different person, I really am. Just after about a week and a half so much has changed. I haven’t had a panic attack or anxiety for about a week. I became a hypochondriac and would worry about every little thing in my body. I have chronic pain so most bodily sensations are extremely exaggerated because my nerve sensitivity. Even when I have bowel movements they can be uncomfortable for painful when most people don’t notice them. I’ve really honestly ignored a lot of them. I can go through my day with my pain pretty much fine now. I’m starting to get some of my natural humor and confidence back. Not much has really changed on the surface, but my mind has healed to what feels like years worth of therapy. 

I’m planning on continuing this, and I would recommend you start if you haven’t been already. Once you start working out you will enjoy it, as long as you ease into it and don’t overwhelm yourself. You’ll start to enjoy it and make goals. And the future will no longer be littered with fears and anxieties, but hope and motivation towards your goals. 

Best of luck to all of you!

Edit: WOAH! I had no idea this was going to explode! Thank you everyone for the awards and your kind words. I wish everyone luck. I’m sorry to anyone who said they’re unable to workout for any reason. I highly suggest trying to contact a specialist (doctor/private trainer/psychologist/therapist etc.) to help you work through any limitations you’re having. Everyone should have at least one thing they can escape to to help their anxiety. 

I do still get some anxiety working out but with time it’s subsiding. What helped the most was easing into it and making sure I was comfortable with my heart rate before trying to push myself. It’s not perfect but it’s just enough freedom to allow myself to improve my stamina and strength.",Proud of you.,1559,99,2021-02-21 23:52:29,lpa08i

Anxiety,Does anyone else get anxiety that manifests in avoidance of enjoyable downtime activities like watching tv or reading?,"I get this with watching shows and reading books I haven’t before, or even doing crafts. I frequently think I’d like to do one of these but get anxious about it so I don’t and just end up on my phone on Reddit (naturally) or watching shows I’ve seen a million times. I think the anxiety might be associated with the distraction or the emotions felt when I do these things - but I feel like a freak who can’t watch TV shows that everyone else watches and enjoys. Does anyone else have this issue or is it just me??

Edit: thank you everyone for responding below - I honestly really felt like I was the only one in the world who felt this way. Thank you for helping me feel like I’m not alone in this!","Definitely! I find a lot of really small things incredibly daunting - humans have a way of wanting to remain idle and fight against change. Even if that change is a new book or tv show. 

It often happens because it almost feels like work. You might feel guilty for going on Reddit, or watching the same old TV. So you project this new experience as something you *should* do and your usual habits as something you *shouldn’t*. 

Try and reframe your thinking and tell yourself that it’s OK to go on Reddit - but it’s also OK if you don’t want to. And it’s OK to not want to read a new book, but it also could be really fulfilling (as it often is). Once you train this muscle by actually following through with new activities, it’ll become like second nature. Sometimes you might “fall off the wagon” and return to routine, but that’s perfectly ok! It’s only natural. What’s important is understanding that once you want to leave that routine, you’re fully capable at any time.

Anxiety,"After a lifelong needle phobia, I managed to get my COVID vaccine!","(I'll be discussing needles and medical stuff in this post!) 

I am **SO** proud of myself, and I know only people with anxiety will be able to appreciate the strength this took and how much of a victory it is! 

I have always had a severe needle phobia (avoided HPV vaccine in school, flu shot, refused tetanus and refused all blood tests). It got to a point where I had to get my flu shot up my nose as a spray every year (ridiculous, I know. but the phobia was deeply ingrained into me)

I knew I would finally have to face my phobia again with the COVID vaccine. Because I knew if I freaked out and just avoided it, it wouldn't be just me I was endangering. Since the start of the year, the vaccine is all I've been thinking about. I was *dreading* getting that text message to say it was my turn. And then I was having several panic attacks a day leading up to the appointment. It was pretty rough.

When the nurse called me in and sat me down, it felt like I was going to pass out or puke or burst into tears... but then I just had this... surreal moment of clarity. I just focused on one of the wall tiles and just... almost tuned out of the situation. And then I felt it go in, and it hurt and I was terrified, but also strangely empowered? Like I couldn't believe I actually got to this exact moment without losing it and running out. 

I felt dizzy with relief and happiness when it was over, I think the nurse probably thought I was crazy haha. I'm just so damn proud I've faced one of my fears. My arm is pretty sore a day later, but I'm doing just fine! And I think I'll be able to handle it again when I get my 2nd dose!","A note to those worried.

Anxiety,Does anyone else feel panicked when they have free time because you don’t know how to “properly” spend it?,"This will be a massive ramble but PLEASE chime in if your brain goes through the same ridiculous thought processes...

I feel like I have no identity or hobbies and that the hobbies i do have aren’t the ‘right’ ones. I like to read and play sims. Sometimes i scrapbook or pour paint but part of me feels like i do those things to be able to say ‘i did something artsy today.’ I’m interested in astronomy but i don’t know how to even start or what an amateur astronomer even does and then i feel imposter syndrome for liking it but not DOING anything astronomy related.

Part of me wants to try new things but other parts of me know this would be just to check off some boxes and i’d be back to square one anyway.

I feel like i have no purpose and i waste my free time trying to figure out who i am instead of being able to BE who i am. I just want the world to pause until i figure it the fuck out so i dont waste another day feeling like this. this has been going on for probably a decade now. 

Ugh. Exhausting.","People think I’m crazy because I like to work. I just think I like routine. My brain explodes with overthinking my days off.

Having a friend or my SO coming over at noon? That's right, trying not to vomit all morning and getting super bloated! By the time they arrive I often feel too sick to enjoy myself.

Anxiety,Does anyone else get heightened anxiety at nighttime / before bedtime?,"Nighttime is hard. Winters are hard. Winters when the sun sets at 5 pm are very hard. Getting to sleep is hard on a good day, and even harder for me these days. Sadly, the lack of sleep only fuels my anxiety and it feels like a hopeless cycle.

Edit: 
Wow! This community never ceases to impress me! Thank you all for your amazing suggestions and ongoing support, I’m truly touched by everyone’s suggestions. I made a list of the suggestions I’ve received so far to consolidate them all in one place for an easy reference guide. I’ll try to add more as I see them and catch up with comments:

- Develop a consistent sleep schedule / routine 
- Incorporating exercise into routine 
- Drinking herbal teas before bed 
- Using a weighted blanket
- Reading  
- Journaling 
- Listening to podcasts (some are also dedicated to helping you fall asleep!)
- Watching / having something on something in the background until you fall asleep
- Alternatively, limiting screen time (phone or television) before bed 
- Diffusing essential oils / spraying pillow before bed
- YouTube videos of distant sounds or ambient sounds
- ASMR videos
- Taking melatonin or Calm (Magnesium Citrate) before bed
- Yoga and meditation in combination or separately 
- Self-care routine before bed 
- Dedicating “worry time” and trying to talk yourself out of the anxious thought spiral early on
- Trying to dedicate your bed for sleep, rather than hanging out there when you aren’t sleepy 
- Taking CBD before bed
- Limiting caffeine and alcohol 

We are not alone. We are strong. We are loved. We will get through this.","My anxiety is definitely worse at nighttime. If I know I have something to do the next day that makes me anxious, then I'll just set myself up for success by limiting alcohol (like max of 1 low abv beer, preferably none), take melatonin,  set out my clothes/ pack my stuff for work, etc.  Mostly try to eliminate anything to make me fret.

Then I scroll reddit/ comment threads until my eyes are sleepy and fall asleep. I have to have something to distract me from my anxious thoughts or the cyclic thoughts take over.

Am I alone in this? I hate anxiety!","Nausea and other digestive issues are very, very normal symptoms of anxiety. 

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/the-gut-brain-connection

I had constant nausea for sixteen years - always queasy at a minimum, often developing to the point of vomiting...sometimes for hours on end. It's awful. Thankfully it was the first symptom to disappear when I started my SSRI but for like half my life, man...and it often resembled the stomach flu, just endless hours in the bathroom in the middle of the night anxious to the point of sickness. Especially during finals in school, the week before and the week of. Not conducive towards being a productive human being. I once had to bail on most of my accounting final because the professor banned us from leaving the room for any reason and I suddenly *had* to go - I threw the exam on her desk and bolted from the room as fast as I could, barely made it in time. I've puked in my fair share of trash cans and bushes.

Peppermint or ginger tea can help. Anxious nausea is typically due to an overproduction of acid so antacids can help.

Anxiety,hidden ways you’re keeping your body in fight or flight mode,"1. tongue cemented to the roof of your mouth? not only are you tensing your jaw, you’re constricting the muscles in your throat. this can make it feel like it’s closing, and can make you swallow more air which in turn can make your stomach hurt. let your tongue rest.

2. head feel heavy as hell? kinda dizzy and wobbly? like a band wrapped around your head?
tension headaches. your neck doesn’t wanna hold up your head anymore. before freaking yourself out. focus on your neck and shoulder muscles, are they sore as hell? move your neck around. drop your shoulders. massage them. watch how fast your head clears up.

3. feel gassy? like you need to burp or fart or something? you just might. get on your knees, put your ass in the air and relax that butt. drink club soda. do yoga. being too gassy can keep an anxious person in fight or flight. 

4. speaking of butts, are you clenching your butthole really tight for no reason? mhm. your body thinks it’s in danger. relax that thing.

5. let your damn tummy hang out. no one cares. give your guts some room to breathe. then breathe WITH that tummy, not your chest.

6. PLEASE. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD. BREATHE OUT. DEEP BREATH OUT. HOLD YOUR BREATH. 
THEN BREATHE IN. YOU SHOULD BE BREATHING IN HALF AS LONG AS YOU BREATHE OUT. YOUR LUNGS KNOW WHAT TO DO, BREATHE RIGHR FOR THEM.


you can’t relax your mind if your body is not relaxed. check these off. then calm your mind. i hope they help. ❤️


Edit: regarding #1, i did NOT think i would have to point this out because i believe in the intelligence you guys have but, your tongue naturally sits on the roof of your mouth. by saying “cemented” i tried to relay that putting an unnecessary amount of pressure on the roof of your mouth can keep you in fight or flight or tense. not just lightly holding it there. again, thought my choice of words put that message across. i apologize to Mew zealots everywhere. thank you.",I've had anxiety for so many years that when I let my tummy out it literally feels unnatural and I've never attributed it to anxiety.

I wanted to talk about breathing.  

A very common technique for coping with anxiety is to breathe deeply - you’ve probably heard this or seen it in an infographic.  This is indeed a helpful technique, but unfortunately I don’t think it is explained well and I have often seen users say that it can make their anxiety worse.  This comes as no surprise when in response to anxiety or a panic attack all you hear is “take a breath!”  Great, I’ll do that, thanks.  I’m going to break down the proper technique piece by piece in the hope that it helps someone out.  

When you are anxious many people feel like they are hyperventilating and the answer to that is because you tense up and your breathing becomes shallow and “high up” (your breaths are filling your upper lungs) which makes the anxiety worse.  You are, in fact, hyperventilating, but you can fix this.  You are in control of your breath as much as it may not feel like it in a moment of panic.  

What you want to do is called [diaphragmatic breathing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaphragmatic_breathing) (or belly breaths if you’re a normal person and not in a medical profession).   To demonstrate this, sit up in a comfortable position and place a hand gently beneath your ribs and on your upper belly - concentrate on expanding this area with each inhale.  This is the breathing you are aiming for.  

What we will be doing is commonly called “[box breathing](https://imgur.com/0N53Gah)”.  

Taking belly breaths:

1. Slowly inhale on a count to four (I find through the nose most effective but breathing through the mouth will do you no harm - just keep it slow). 
1. Hold the breath for a count to 4
1. Exhale for a count to 4
1. Hold the empty lungs for a count to 4.  

Repeat until your anxiety eases or your breathing resumes a normal rhythm.  

That’s it!  I hope this explanation helps out someone, I know it certainly helped me.  Practice it when you’re calm and the next time the anxiety ramps up, give it a try.  I’ve also used this technique to steady myself for taking low-light photos and building card towers.  Bonus.  

Love, 

Remy","While being anxious, there is a spike in heart beat, in my case 25-30bpm. Can this method help with that as well?",1304,75,2021-01-08 21:10:08,ktbvae
Anxiety,"Does anyone else talk to themselves and have conversations in your mind all day, everyday?","I tend to over think EVERYTHING from having to plan my trip to the store to my boyfriend not cuddling me before we go to sleep leaving me crying because I think he doesn’t love me anymore. It affects me so much in my life when sometimes it’s not even worth it, it’s just me entertaining a unrealistic thought. Everyday from the moment I wake up till I go to sleep I am talking to myself in my brain mostly it speaks negatively it makes me overthink everything I do. I am at the point where I know I am overthinking and entertaining unrealistic ideas but once it’s in my mind I can not get it out. I get these thoughts that somehow get into my mind and I won’t let go of it and keep digging at it and keeping the topic wondering in my mind all day or for days even. It can be something so small and I can’t focus on anything else but that one thing or something multiple things. I have tried to explain this feeling to people close in my life, I try to explain it as having multiple tabs open on your browser and you are running through the tabs clicking and opening every tab as if you are rushing a last minute research assignment jumping from tab from tab. Whenever i explain my over thinking they tell me “you’re just making yourself over think, you’re doing this to your self just stop overthinking” which makes no sense to me!! How can I just stop thinking?? i would love to but my brain is just always running. This happens even when I am trying to go to sleep which makes sleeping soo hard i have gone to the doctor for insomnia and depression but I have never thought these are the results and side effects of having tons of anxiety. It’s all a dangerous cycle I have fell in for years. Although at first i remember it being mostly depression and feeling of helplessness but these days it’s not even me getting anxious from being depressed because I wouldn’t say I’m depressed anymore but I just anxious, more than I ever have been. So I’m starting to see maybe it’s anxiety that is the stem for most of my other problems. I’m so tired of it effecting my everyday life. If you have any tips for making your mind not be so loud and controlling please leave comment I am so tired of letting myself bring myself down every single day.","Hey, I can't help but I can totally relate to your problem.

Anxiety,Medication has made me realized how much anxiety I actually had compared to how much I thought I had,"I've had anxiety all my life and this year, especially after all the covid lockdowns, I noticed my anxiety and depression was significantly worse than usual. So I went on medication this time.

The first week was terrible but as it's settling in, my anxiety is disappearing. I had no idea that my anxiety was as bad as it was until it disappeared. Before the medication, if I had a problem at work or with another person, I would dwell on it for hours or sometimes days. I presumed I was just a sensitive person but I've realised it was the anxiety.

I thought my anxiety were just the attacks I had or when it was really bad that I couldn't leave the house, I did not realize I had it every single day. I must have just got so used to having anxiety all my life that it seemed normal to me.

I can actually deal with issues as they arise rather than having to tip toe around it. There is a big chuck of what I thought was my general personality that has actually turned out to be my anxiety.","Congratulations!!! Medication was an absolute godsend for me.

Anxiety,Does anyone else get home from work and obsess over every interaction they've had during the day?,"This happens to me every day I come home from work. I'll have constant flash-backs to some cringy thing I said or did and I just sit on the couch and freak out and it makes chilling after work impossible. 

It doesn't help that im super anxious around people so I'm always overanalysing myself at work and I'm constantly worried about coming across some type of way and so I don't say much (which i think probably just makes me seem rude anyway). 

Is anyone else stuck being so critical over every interaction they have? And has anyone found anything that helps them wind down after interacting with people? I'm so exhausted mentally and it makes work hell. 

Sorry for any formatting issues I'm on mobile.","Immediately after I do something deemed cringeworthy in my mind (which let’s be honest, when you have anxiety that can be a lot of things) I obsessively think about it and how people perceived it. It really is very crippling and I can’t even bare to think about the amount of hours I’ve spent criticizing myself because of this. 

Try to tell yourself that you are just doing the best you can. You’re not doing anything cringeworthy. You’re just you. Take a deep breath (or as many as it takes, the kind where you feel it in the center of your chest) and try to be kind to yourself. I don’t know you but I bet you’re a great person to work with because it’s clear you’re not self-centered. I wish we were coworkers because we could commiserate about this together!

I hope it gets better for you. You’re doing your best and it’s ok to take up space and exist! Try to give yourself a little break if you can. I know it’s hard but it’ll get easier with time and practice.",1264,76,2021-06-11 10:51:47,nxd3px

Anxiety,My therapist recently taught me a trick that has been actually changing my life,"It's pretty simple and may seem obvious, but just make up your mind. That's it. Think about a thing, take in all the factors/risks, then *decide* what you're going to do. 

Don't question it after that. You already know you spent the time ruminating over it, you already took in every detail, now stop the cycle of over/repetitive thinking and decide. I know it's easier said than done, but with some practice this can be so helpful. 

Most fear/anxiety comes from the unknown, yeah? I think many people agree about that. We can never be sure what will happen in a future situation, so we tend to spin it *over* and *over* and *over* for no reason. Spinning it again won't make the answer any clearer, just make up your mind and stop. You'll see what happens when you get there, all that you can control is what *you* do leading up to it. 

I really hope this can help some of you. I've struggled with GAD and many phobias/panic attacks for years. This has been the most impactful trick that I've used. If y'all can trust yourself, it can make the difference",Thanks for this tip!!! I bet it takes some getting used to? I always get caught in the self doubt and rumination trap it’s so hard to get out of it. I’ll remember this. 🥰,1248,53,2021-05-06 23:25:09,n6kr5j

Anxiety,I am so proud of myself and I need to tell someone,"Two years ago I was too scared to leave my house. 

Today I decided to visit my dad an apply for an internship abroad. 

To visit my dad I have to travel by train for eight hours. Two years ago I couldn't get on the bus to go to college.

The internship will be ten weeks long. Two years ago I had panic attacks about going into the garden. 

I feel so extremely proud of myself, even if my family and friends don't understand. I'm starting to be myself again, even though I was never adventurous. 

I finally feel okay doing things on my own.


Edit: First off all I want to thank all of you for the kind words and awards. I woke up this morning and was greated with so many kind and lovely responses. 

I've seen quite a lot of people asking about how I got here. The thing is, I don't have a simple answer (although I guess the answer to anxiety is never simple).

If it wasn't for my lovely SO I wouldn't have gotten this far. At one point he said: I want to go on holiday. We don't have to be gone for long, we don't have to go far away. You can choose the location and if you just want to hang around the hotelroom every day that's fine. But I need a break from daily life. 

I spent most of the holiday in the hotel but I did go for a few walks. Having a panic attack in a different country feels different; the people who see you will never see you again, so it took away some of the shame aspect for me. 

After that summer college started again. I hadn't gone much the year before but I talked to my teachers and they allowed me to repeat the year. I didn't dare to take the bus (my anxiety is centered around being locked up) so I cycled to college every day for a while. 

When the weather got colder I realized I didn't want to cycle 13 kilometres through the snow so I tried going by bus. Not going anywhere, just getting in and seeing how many stops I could survive.

So, I kind of did exposure therapy on myself. I eventually got through the waiting list of a psychologist but by then I could go out by myself. After she went away for pregnancy leave I just pushed myself further and further. 

SO and I moved house in April to a cheap but lovely appartment in a lovely neighbourhood in a small village. I finally feel a bit at peace and I think that caused my sudden progress. 

This probably won't really help anyone as seeing a  professional probably is better than doing it all by yourself. I am just lucky enough to have my SO for support, even if he will never understand how important he was in this process.",I'm super happy for you!

Anxiety,Anyone else wake up hours early for things only to lay awake doing absolutely nothing for as long as possible?,"I can’t believe I never put 2 and 2 together and thought of this as a way that my anxiety manifests. For as long as I can remember I have done this, I like to wake up super early for things and just lay there doing nothing because I feel like sleeping all the way until the stressful event is too fast and if I just lay there awake I can savor every second that I have of not doing the thing. 

I used to do this every morning before work when I had a job I didn’t like. I did it all the time for school especially in middle school. I just did it for my first day of classes this semester and I’m a senior in college. Woke up at like 3:30 for no reason and never even tried to go back to sleep. Just laid there under my blanket trying to keep my mind as blank as possible and enjoy the nothingness before my day. 

Also, sorry if this has been posted a million times, anxiety is something I’ve long been diagnosed with but I have always avoided it and only now am I starting to try to share about it and confront it little by little.","Same here. I’ve been this way ever since I was little. I was under the impression that I’m just a morning *and* a night person, when really it was anxiety all along.

&#x200B;

I am happy to have plenty of free time once I'm off from work, about 6 hours till I go to sleep so 5-6 hours of me doing what I want but when something simple like letting the dog out, shaving, cleaning a bathroom comes up I get anxiety thinking oh crap I'm, not gonna have enough time to do what I wanna do....how can you get past this? It's obviously silly to me because doing all that takes very little time and when i do have free time I spend it watching tv and hardly doing anything productive...

Anxiety,Does anyone else feel most of their anxiety would dissipate if society would just lay off?,The majority of my anxiety is driven by societal expectations.

I hate appointments and social gatherings because people expect me to appear normal and put-together. I hate this century because I feel like a wild animal that is expected to pay taxes instead of thriving in nature and foraging for food.,"YES.  My anxiety is very work related.  The pressure to be an extremely hard worker with some hot career is such bullshit to me.  I always have a ton of shame associated with my lack of a career, work ethic and having no money.

Anxiety,It’s honestly baffling to me that there are people who approach new experiences without crippling fear,"Seriously. I got a new job and I had my first real task earlier this week. And I spent the *entire* week in and out of anxiety attacks. Couldn’t get out of bed. But also couldn’t sleep. I felt physically ill and wanted to vomit but I couldn’t. I couldn’t eat anything except some bread that I forcefed myself just so that I could take antacids. And all I could do was sob uncontrollably and think of how much I want to die. 

Then the work task I had been dreading happened, and...my symptoms just melted away. It was almost magical. I felt so relieved but also so incredibly stupid. I *knew* nothing seriously bad could happen, that even the worst case scenario was pretty alright. But my body was just convinced I was going to die. It’s like my nervous system is a mechanical bull without an off switch and all I can do is hang on for dear life while it knocks me around and tires itself out. No chance at conversation or understanding, just mindless panic. 

All I want is to punch my anxiety in the face and yell “can we at least talk about this?”",I am sorry you were going through this! I dealt with this exact thing this week also from work (except I am still anxious about it as it is 99% complete and now out of my hands- just not as severe anymore) I am sorry this is happening to you!! This is also my first time on this thread and reading people explain the exact symptoms I feel is actually a bit comforting. So know you are not alone in this and I understand how terrible it is to feel this way. I hope you now have some peace!,1199,33,2021-02-20 12:08:17,lo5uv7
Anxiety,"Is anyone else anxious about going back to work and mental health awareness disappearing as soon as we go back to ""normal""?",,"My employer (a large health authority) has been banging the drum of workplace mental health for the last several months of WFH (every newsletter, employee memo, including wellness check-ins at many meetings, etc.) and I'm just perplexed. I struggle way more with anxiety when working at the office. And had way less time to engage in the things that help me manage my anxiety and depression. 

Since working from home I go for a 45min walk outside in the forest with my dogs every lunch hour. I have time to stay on top of house cleaning so it doesn't consume my whole weekend. I sleep until 7am instead of 5:30am and still have an hour to stretch, make a balanced breakfast, go for a walk, etc instead of jumping in the car barely awake. I'm saving money by never eating out. I have TWO EXTRA HOURS to myself everyday that I'm not spending commuting. 

If they genuinely cared about employee mental health they would take the results of a survey to heart that found upwards of 90% of staff want to have the option of WFH after the pandemic (or at least until herd immunity is reached). I'm going to be so pissed if they think their wellness articles and reminders to 'get up and stretch every 20mins' is an equivalent alternative to the balance I've found working from home.

Anxiety,does anyone else adore the rain?,"I have no idea why, but when it rains or when it storms it gives me so much peace of mind. it helps me for some reason and it eases my body and it allows me to relax therefore easing my anxiety symptoms. it’s raining right now and I feel so care free and good I’m not sure why. does anyone else feel this. I get so happy when it rains and i100% prefer it over a sunny day.","Completely agree. It's super relaxing and really helps me focus.

I have spent an hour preparing. I have done breathing exercises to calm myself down and not cry. I prepared my bed for the ease of running away and hiding in it as soon as the phone call is done. I rehearsed my opening line and all possible outcomes. I considered just not calling, but told myself ""NO this is important, you can do this!""

I finally press the call button and the signal sound makes me even more anxious. I keep breathing and rehearsing.

And then they just... don't pick up.

Anxiety,Anyone else feel like they’re too difficult to love?,"Between the constant panic and worrying, the irritability, the non stop second guessing. The sometimes not being able to do normal every day things alone like shopping and driving. I feel like I’ll never have a solid relationship where someone understands me. I feel undeserving of love. There’s no way I could ever maintain a healthy relationship and the reality of this sucks.","I feel similar. 

I do not feel undeserving of love, yet I am clear with myself that it ain’t easy to be with me. I‘m not jealous, not needy etc, but like you said, I have anxiety when it comes to shopping, or going to get together and my bf has to go alone often because I prioritiese my mental health over being at these events. 

What I feel is that whenever I met someone in the past and the first love cloud blinds them, they say how they don’t mind, how it‘s not a Problem and they will never be annoyed by my anxiety and need to unwind alone more often than others - though I know better and tell them so (maybe I shouldn’t). And, surprise, after 6 to 9 months it starts to be a problem, maybe not one that gets said out loud a lot, but you feel if someone thinks „Why can‘t she be easy going, extroverted and social a bit more?“ 

It feels like partners start to try to change my after the first glow of being in love is over, and to me that means it isn’t love - the kind that you feel for someone unconditionally, take them as they are, as the person you met. 

I really hope you find your person, the ones who isn’t only in love or has a crush on you, but who will love you more each day exactly how you are and support you.",1188,75,2021-07-09 12:18:06,ogud85
Anxiety,How generalised anxiety disorder works,"So here is how my anxiety disorder looks like: your mum sends you a photo of the dog walking, with no caption. The leash looks like it broke on the photo so you call her. She doesn’t answer. You automatically go into a panic thinking the dog run away and got hit by a car and now your mum is panicking and that is why she doesn’t answer her phone so you keep calling and calling and crying and struggling to breathe until she eventually answers, and it was just the sun reflecting on the photo and the leash is fine and your dog is fine and everyone is fine, but you are now drained and just want to go hide under the covers and recuperate.",Yup... That's the gist. Had a complete meltdown Sunday after coming home from my parents and not being able to find my cat who has never run outside before and is scared of everything and would never try to run away... I just knew he was out on the streets lost and I was hysterical. He was just hiding in a different closet than usual. 😑 My brain goes from 0-100 in a blink of an eye...,1168,66,2021-07-14 10:07:51,ok19yt

Anxiety,Putting my dog down tomorrow. I’m freaking out,"My dog is my best friend,  after everyday of me being on leave due to my anxiety he was by my side supporting me, he loves me and I love him.  He’s the best dog in the world. 

Unfortunately he has a very crazy cancer that is spreading over his body. I ache for him and want to relieve him, but I am unsure how I am going to handle it.  He’s not a legal therapy dog, but is definitely my therapy.  

I don’t know what to do,  I am picking him up from icu tomorrow and bringing him home to die in peace in his favorite spot.  I am having him privately cremated and returned to me.  He is only 5 years old for Christ sake.  

[here is my boy](https://imgur.com/gallery/x2coH9C)


Edit:  I really appreciate all the support, we go to pick up my boy in a few hours from ICU at the university of Florida. It’s a long drive and I hope he makes it home okay.  We’ve been all over trying to get him the best care and to save his life.   He has an awful pneumonia right now that refuses to heal due to the spreading cancer, so hearing him breath is very difficult.  I know what I am doing is the best for him, but it really doesn’t make me feel better.  I am constantly wishing they’d magically call me and tell me he’s okay, as stupid as that sounds.   He’s scheduled to be put down at 4pm est at home with me by his side his whole time.  [here is my favorite picture of him](https://imgur.com/gallery/6F9wtXG)

Edit 2: he’s in the car with me. I’m reading him all your comments   I can tell he likes them

Final edit: Arthas passed away at 4:15pm est at his home surrounded by the people who loved him more than he could possibly know.  I love you boy. I’ll miss you forever.  [Rest in peace Arthas](https://imgur.com/gallery/Mq9zQMK)","I will be praying for both of you. 

Just know the last thing he will see is his bestfriend's face and the last thing he will smell is his bestfriend's scent and the last thing he will feel is his bestfriend's warm touch.

May he find relief and comfort",1162,87,2021-04-26 03:12:30,myobkf
Anxiety,Anyone else get the urge to just leave everything behind and go live in a log cabin in the mountains?,"Lately ive become more and more unsure what i want from my life, and everytime I feel sad, mad or deprived of energy i just wanna pack my shit and go, its mostly a coping mechanism i think, but its also way more. I fantasize about living somewhere else or in a different reality, because i feel like i could never achieve an interesting life where i am now.  I know I have to start working towards something in order to feel fulfilled but since i have no idea what i want, i lose motivation soon enough. And thus i get stuck in this cycle of mediocrity, of understanding what i need to do, but not a reason as to why to do it. 

At this point im not even sure wether iv ever had or still have depression/anxiety/mental illness, i just know that since i was a kid ive never ever felt fullfilled. The past years ive seen problems come at me from so far away but i never seem to have the energy to move out of the way of the problem coming at me.

And lately it seems all the rest i get is from ether being asleep or getting drunk/high and finally getting rid of the annoyance that is being consience without purpose.

Dont worry about substance abuse because even though im without purpose, for some reason my mind wont let me get addicted to something it knows is bad. So i guess subconsciously im still hoping for a better future.",Only all the damn time,1147,100,2021-08-05 01:07:42,oy6u9l

Anxiety,I'm quitting my job due to anxiety. I feel like a failure.,"The day has finally come. After six years of teaching, I know I need to quit. My acid reflux and insomnia have gotten so bad that I feel like dying most days. People keep telling me to hang in there - that teaching gets better with time and experience. But it only keeps getting worse for me. The racing thoughts are ceaseless.

Now I need to figure out how to tell my supervisor. I know it's going to be a huge disappointment to him. He needs me. My school needs me. My students need me. But I need to put my health first now. I can't imagine what everyone is going to think of me. They will probably think I'm crazy or weak or both.

I've been looking for other jobs the past two years and haven't been able to find anything. I will be moving back home and living off of unemployment for as long as I can. Hopefully I can find something else soon.

Edit: Wow I want to thank everyone from the bottom of my heart. I've never felt so seen and supported in my life (and I'm not just saying that). I wrote this post as a ""let me just get these bad feelings out and send them out into the universe"" type of thing, never thinking I would get so much love in return. You are all amazing people and you are all FIGHTERS - not failures. You have helped me see that I am not a failure either, and I wish I could give each and every one of you a hug. I wish all of you the happiness and health that life has to offer. Thank you x a million. ","That is a huge success--putting yourself first. Try not to think of it as a failure, but instead as a step in the right direction. You can reconsider once your nerves are a little less shot. I am in the same boat right now, unemployed and living at my parents house. Some days I get really down on myself but other days I'm like FUCK YEAH I'm not having panic attacks every day after work and wanting to die because of my physical symptoms.

Anxiety,A stranger destroyed all my confidence.,"I was standing in line for food and this woman her mother and her boyfriend came up behind me and asked if i was in line, i said a simple ""oh, yeah"" pointed at the line, went back to fiddling on my phone to ease my anxiety. And thus began the fifteen minute barrage of degrading comments. She made fun of my voice, the way i stood, i leaned against a wall and she made fun of it. I tried texting someone about the pinch i was in and she made fun of me for texting so much. By the time i finally got to order i could hardly speak because i was on the verge of throwing up. The whole time she made fun of me i was just hanging my head pretending not to hear...im never going back there again even though it was my favorite place to eat. When i leave the house now i feel so small and worthless. Everything she said was all the ""silly"" things my anxiety constantly nagged me about that I constantly assured myself nobody cared about.

Anxiety,I no longer have suicidal thoughts,"Well actually I haven’t had it for maybe weeks now, not since January or early February. In my head, what started off as a thoughts of how to kill myself if I reach my suicidal phase turns into a “I want to die.” But I realize that I can’t kill myself, because I can’t do it, it’s not in me, it’s in my head but it doesn’t tell me to do it. I never attempted it and can’t even cut my arm. So I stop having it because it’s not gonna happen.

For a while, I think the reasoning behind this is because I’m a coward, I couldn’t end the pain of living so I have to live like you’re half alive and half dead at the same time. Recently, I talk about this to a lad I know, and he said that wasn’t cowardice, that was bravery. 

Because despite all the shit that happens to me and around me and in the world, I still choose to live. Despite growing up in a dysfunctional family, despite not studying that much in school and potentially not getting into college, despite the world being a shitty place where the rich gets richer where the rest burns in hell. Despite all of that odds, I’m still here. Not living fully, but still breathing, that’s a plus for me I guess, I am crawling but I am moving slowly. I went to sleep that night and give myself a smile in the dark because why not? It’s a command given by a brain, but a smile. Maybe I’ll read a book, idk.","I agree with the person you know, that is definitely bravery. One of our most basic human instincts is to live. If you were feeling so low that you felt suicidal then you were clearly dealing with a lot. I’m sorry you were going through that but I admire you for speaking so candidly about it on here and for being able to voice a desire to live.

Edit #2: do you guys in the replies think maybe you’re being is sensitive than others? I consider myself a clairsentient empath, which is a nice gift and I’m grateful, but it also means that I am highly sensitive to other people’s energy. So my social anxiety is the one I struggle with most. I can feel. Every. Fucking. Thing. No joke. I can feel if someone looks at me, and throws a judgement my way. It’s like every time that I go out I have to put this huge mental shield around my body and focus on staying grounded, or it’s really challenging, so many things to feel, to process.","Are you me?

Yeah, this is the worst I've been in a long time. I want to puke and cry every morning and then when I try to analyse my life, I come to the conclusion that my life really isn't that bad and somehow that just makes it worse!

Repeat this for a minute or as long as you need, and you will feel better. Try to smile if you can because it does help a bit. If it's still tight, it helps to hold the tension (safely) on purpose, and then let the tension go as you exhale. For your chest try breathing in fully (belly-chest-head), holding it, and ""squeezing"" the air to your head. After a bit (10 seconds or so) let it go and feel the tension dissipate.

Anxiety,Reminder: Anxiety is suffering a simulation,"The suffering is real but you're suffering a simulation. It's not real. 

It's imaginary. 

It's all lies.

A part of your own mind made it up so it can't be an actual danger.

Actual dangers come from outside you.

Fear is meant to protect you from danger. 

But when fear overworks and causes life to become a living hell, it loses its whole point of existence.

Fear isn't meant to make you suffer endlessly, it is only meant to spur you to act in defense for a short while. If you keep looping in a fear cycle, fear has defeated its own purpose and should stop functioning.

There is a reasonable amount of light fear called Eustress that is justified and keeps you on your toes in a hostile environment. Anything more than that fear, anything that paralyses you, that hinders your full functioning, that prevents you from thinking straight, that prevents you from working according to a plan, is excess fear, and by definition has defeated its own purpose. Such fear has no point existing.

The higher number of times you affirm ""I'm actually safe except for XYZ"" the the faster you will feel better.

Remember, unless you're actually in an active war zone or shooting, you;re quite safe. Say it to yourself - ""I'm actually quite safe except for XYZ"".

Finally, remember: Hot flashes, crawling ants, crampy, pain, tingling, needles and other sensations, are _discomfort_, not danger. 

Discomfort is uncomfortable, but safe.

Anxiety,You aren’t dying.,"You aren’t dying. You don’t have a rare disease or cancer. No tumors or some weird flesh eating virus that hasn’t been seen in decades. You aren’t going insane. You don’t have MS, or any other genetic disorder. You have anxiety. May I suggest a list of good vibes for this spooky season?? 

1) love yourself. Actually mean it though. Look in the mirror and instead of analyzing your body over anything that appears to be different tell yourself how amazing you are. 

2) drink water, I mean lots of water, drink some liquid IV also. Comes in many flavors and it’s a lot healthier than other drinks. Try to lay off the sodas (however treat yourself every now and then)

3) sleep. I mean sleep like you never slept before. Go to bed earlier, turn your phone on airplane mode and just let the cold room engulf you as if you are in the Arctic (that’s how cold I love it) 

4) eat healthier. Try not to eat chips, junk food. Baked chicken and veggies are great always. (Again treat yourself every once in awhile) 

5) breathing exercises. This is a great way to relieve stress and anxiety. Did you know breathing can help with a lot of medical problems? I suggest you read a book called “Breath” by James Nestor. It’s an extraordinary piece of work.

Remember to love yourself and remember that I love you.","this is simple reassurance but it means a lot, thank you",1105,78,2021-10-06 06:24:41,q2emiu

 Please give yourself credit. Do you know what you did by simply posting that post about (x) ?? Someone might relate to it, and need help on (x) , someone might just be interested in (x) and read about it, someone might be going exactly what you’re going through, but remain silent... maybe they’ll speak up because of you!!

With one push of a “POST” , amazing things are sure to come with it... you spoke up about it... and that is SO GOOD! 

You’re more amazing than you know. You matter to me, if that means anything. 

Take care.

Please stay safe.

If anyone needs me, I’m always just a message away!! I don’t mind listening :) love to hear from new people!!

Keep your heads held high, hope you all have an amazing day / night... wherever you may live!

I’m sorry I ended up falling asleep! It was 3 am or so when I wrote this, and I thought “only a couple of people will see it” ... boy, was I wrong. 

Thanks for the awards, someone mentioned that someone wrote something similar, but its hard to find that post.. — something like that - so I’ll try my best to contribute a lot more here; probably a weekly thing! Like a weekly check up , see how everyone is, and such :) 

I’m just about to read the comments now, and reply!

We all have that thought of “this looks so dumb” , “why am I doing this?” when about to post online on a subreddit, and in social media in general... 

Know all those TikTok “famous people” ?? They are human, too. They probably were sure as ducky duck scared to post online for others to view , judge , comment , like , etc.,, but now look? They are perfectly okay with posting whatever — even sometimes the silliest, stupidest things... those who comment “I wish I had the ability to do what you do” ... *You can* 

Nothing is stopping you. You are only stopping yourself! 

With one little push of a “post” could change your life.. change someones life, emotions, thinking process.. think its scary , right?! It is!!

Yes , anxiety...other mental illnesses... but THOSE DO NOT DEFINE YOU. You are more than your mental illness. Don’t be afraid to do what you love, and keep doin it! 

I am with you every step of the day. 

Together, we will both live our “dream life” ... take care, sendin prayers that you have a good life!",You are such an awesome person! thank you. much love,1075,39,2021-03-25 06:54:45,mcs4fd

Anxiety,Does anyone else find themselves having anxiety about having to get up early in the morning?,"I'm 27. I've been trying to get to the root of my anxiety and this morning, while driving to work, it dawned on me (no pun intended) that the source of my anxieties might have to do with my disdain of having to get up early for work.

I have a problem where I can't stop thinking about work during weekends, when I'm home at night, on vacation, etc. Work dominates my thinking, but in an unproductive way. I don't go over anything specific, I simply ruminate about the fact that I have to do it. A lot of it has to do with my disdain of not being able to have full control over my time and having to sacrifice so much of my life to a job.

I typically end up having a decent day at work, nothing wild. Every now and again I'll have a hell day. I often fear having those days, weeks in advance, and they typically never come, but they eventually do. 

Going back to my time, a massive hurdle for me is accepting that I need to get to bed early so that I can have enough energy for the following day. There is something about that...and it makes me feel powerless. It feels like the rest of my life is just a waiting room for work but I realize how absurd that sounds. I know it's untrue, but we also live in such a hyper industrial and profit-addicted capitalist society that I know (unfortunately) that what I'm saying has some form of validity to it, and I wish it weren't so.

Anyone else experience this? I'm a grown guy with a career and yet here I am, at the best job I've had to date, miserable about having to go to it because it means I don't have full control over my time.",I wrote this post apparently,1040,78,2021-11-16 01:29:26,quvxse

After being woke up to the sound of screaming again this morning, I finally stood up to my housemate and told her that she woke me up and that I was upset. She's famously combative so she tried to argue with me but for once, adrenaline kicked into my system in a useful way and I didn't back down.

Anxiety,I'm angry at everyone who didn't notice I was struggling as a child,"This turned out to be quite a long ramble/vent but I just needed someone to listen.

I recently started the long process of getting a diagnosis and help for my anxiety. I haven't even gotten to a psychiatric nurse yet, not to speak of a doctor or an actual psychiatrist, but I have talked to the nurse who took first initiative in my case. She was very kind and offered to meet me face to face a few weeks before the psychiatric nurse appointment so I wouldn't have to wait well over a month to get any progress at all. During my appointment with her we quickly got to at least one of the reasons as to why I'm so anxious and it helped me realise that I have actually been prone to anxious behaviour from a young age.

What's now bothering me is that after the appointment I started to realise that I was indeed displaying signs of anxiety or trauma responses as a child but none of the adults in my life actually noticed it or cared enough (or maybe knew enough) to do something about it. Absolutely no one. I had both of my parents and many many teachers who just ignored all of it and that is probably one of the reasons I'm such a mess today. I did not get the help I needed as a child and now everything is a million times worse.

Now every time I get an anxious spell I cannot stop thinking about how the people who were supposed to care for me failed me horribly. It got even worse yesterday when my mother told me a story of her completely ignoring some quite alarming behaviour because she thought it was just a quirk of mine. I had an event I consider traumatic during my first ever swimming lesson in 1st grade. Long story short, the swimming instructor was angry screaming at me because I, as a 7 or 8 year old child, couldn't float on my own yet. After this event I completely stopped doing everything that had to do with swimming even though playing in the lake with floaties on was one of my favourite summer activities before the incident. I didn't continue swimming until over 5 years later when I finally learned how to swim due to mandatory swimming lessons as a part of school sports. Even now almost 20 years later I get anxious at the smell of swimming pools and chlorine and I avoid swimming halls, especially the one where it happened.

Yet somehow, my own god-damn parent, who was often overprotective of me, didn't think there was anything alarming about that. She was telling the story like it was just a weird little thing I chose to do, one of those funny little childhood anecdotes. And the swimming incident is just one of the many different events I remember, where I displayed anxiety symptoms and no one took them seriously. I just want to be angry and scream at everyone who did not notice my problems but that's never going to happen and I know that one day I will just have to make peace with the fact that most of them will never know how badly they failed me. But today is definitely not that day.","Me too, me too...

Turns out adults can be very ignorant as long as you're quiet and out of the way.

It's hard to let that go. Whether it's parents who did nothing or professionals who did nothing. The resentment is hard to let go when you're stuck with the consequences of their inaction.",989,72,2021-08-02 21:30:57,owodyh
Anxiety,I ate after 5 days.,"I knew it was time to eat. I have emetophobia ( the fear of vomit ) & it has stopped me from eating for the last 5 days.

Today, I was going to go another day without eating to avoid a panic attack. But enough was enough.

I had a few fries, a chicken nugget & 3 bites of a burger. It wasn't much, but it was something & I'm so happy. 

It was hard to swallow & chew, but I managed to do so calmly :) I go to the doctors tommorow to get anxiety medication as well!!

UPDATE : I got the medication. Before taking it, I was having mini snacks like smoothies & crisps. Then for dinner my mum brought home KFC & I could barely eat it. So I decided to take the first pill, very worried.

At first I was confused as to how to feel about it, I just felt numb. But then I started eating, without a thought in my head. No nausea, no dry throat, no rapid heartbeat. I ate my first BIG meal & feel no guilt. I truly feel like I've found myself again. I started singing again, listening to music, writing & socialising with my friends.","a win for today!

Anxiety,Anyone else rewatch the same shows over and over?,"This past year has been tough on all of us I’m sure. I know I have been having an extremely difficult time with managing my anxiety. One thing that I recently noticed I do when I’m anxious is I rewatch shows or movies. It’s not something new, but its something I realized just now. I have rewatched The Regular Show in it’s entirety for the 4th time now as well as a handful of other shows. I have watched my favorite Disney films again and again over the course of this past year. One impressive feat (for me at least) is I have watched all of South Park 3 times now lol. It’s something that feels familiar to me I suppose so it helps calm me down? You’d think out of the thousands and perhaps millions of viewing options available on streaming services, I would watch something else. Just wondering if anyone else has these tendencies as well.","I do this, too! I read  somewhere that the predictability of rewatching a show is comforting.

Hopefully I'd build a cabin, live off the land and just stay there with my partner (and maybe a dog) with everything that we need around us. There wouldn't be the need to talk to anyone else, no unecessary conversations and no awkward silences to make my anxiety go through the roof trying to think of what to say.

I've suffered with Social Anxiety, General Anxiety and Depression for most of my life and have always felt more at peace and happier when out in the wilderness and cut off from everybody else.","Yes. This sounds idyllic. A couple of years ago I rented an air bnb in Scotland, miles from anywhere. I remember lying on the sofa and feeling at peace. It made me realise that I hadn't felt like that for decades.",981,57,2021-01-02 15:10:36,koyzrv
Anxiety,Consumed by regret after missing out on life for 26 years.,"I am 26 and have not lived. I've never learned how to swim, never learned how to drive, never had sex, never been in a relationship, and never left my hometown. I am a 15 year old in an adult body. Barely passed high school and college (<3.0 GPA). Got fired from my first professional job during college in under a year for performance issues. Graduated college and haven't found a full-time job after almost two years. Still live at home. Feel like imposter around people my age and younger in long-term relationships, marriages, and careers. 

I was diagnosed with GAD in my last year of university and have been through five therapists on-and-off over the past ten years. I was never really one to blame my upbringing for personal issues, but it's difficult not to resent my parents and society to some extent. Single mother, absent father, low-income household. The impact it's had is obvious, and I recognize the same emotional immaturity and dysfunction across my family. 

The acute anxiety I experienced in my teens and early 20's has shifted toward an increasingly all-consuming grief of my adolescence. It is becoming harder to wake up in the morning. My last hope is landing a decent job and being able to buy some lost time, but at 26+ it's hard not to feel like my inexperience is exponentially insurmountable toward developing a fulfilling career and intimate relationships. I struggle to convince myself it's not too late to live, and that if I manage to, the rest of my life will not be plagued by current regrets.","I'm sorry you feel this way, I understand that feeling of ""not having lived my life"" I too feel the same sometimes, at 28. You are a young person, you have a lot of time ahead of you, you never know what life will give you further along the way. The good thing is that you have realised you don't want to keep living like this anymore anda recognition and acknowledgement is a very important step. You have already taken it.

I hope you find something that is worth living for, no matter how little. (At the moment it is books and pilates for me)

Anxiety,I wish I could have a surgery to get rid of this fucking anxiety,"I've done so much work to get where I am and it never gets easier, it never gets better, it never heals and it never stops being hard. Compared to what I was a few years ago I am so far ahead... but it's fucking exhausting, I feel like every I have a weight around my neck.  If I could get a surgery to have a part of my brain removed I would do it, even if it took away a part of me I would do it","When i was younger , I was not self aware and I didn't know  what the hell was wrong with me. I would imagine shooting a bullet into my brain and kill that part that made me feel so scared and anxious all the time.

Anxiety,Booked my COVID vaccine for tomorrow. Could someone reassure me I’m doing the right thing?,"My anxiety has been a living nightmare lately. The talk of vaccines and Covid has also been mentally draining me, and I feel so scared. 

I finally booked my vaccine, because I know I need to pick between this vaccine or this illness. 

As a mom, I feel I need to be strong and I need to vaccinate myself to limit the spread. 

I have so much health anxiety lately. I’m worried I’m going to have an anxiety attack and think the symptoms of anxiety are side effects of the vaccine. 

I just need reminders and reassurance I’m doing the right thing. That I’m going to be okay and still be able to be a mom. 
I’m such a mess right now. These thoughts are so intrusive. 

I am hoping once I receive it, and side effects go away, that I will feel better. I hope I will feel protected and more safe. 
I just want a break from this anxiety.","5.7 billion doses have been distributed globally. If these vaccines were even remotely dangerous, we'd be facing a health crisis much, much worse than COVID itself.

This alone was the fact I needed to get past my anxiety about the shot.",970,158,2021-09-15 14:11:01,poqvsn
Anxiety,Has anyone had their anxiety reduce by decluttering/tidying up the living space?,"I'm not a hoarder per definition (I don't think), but I do have a lot of stuff. Many things I don't really know what to do with. Hobby stuff from parents, old school books etc....they saved too many things. I also have several projects started but never finished.

There is a lot of nostalgia attached to these items, so they also feel comforting in a way.

But I've started to think if I may reduce my anxiety by simplifying, as the things also seem to take up a lot of mental energy for me.

I notice when I've been out biking/walking that my anxiety increases a lot when coming back to my house.

Do you have any experience of this or any suggestions? Thx.","Tidying and cleaning out things I don’t need is a really great stress reliever for me, and even depression reliever. It’s something productive, and the result is a simpler, cleaner living space for yourself. 

I understand holding onto old things for nostalgia. I do too, but I find the nostalgic value wears off after a while. So it’s worth tossing or donating things I don’t need for my own mental sake. 

Point being, I do recommend it. And now with spring cleaning is the perfect opportunity to do so.",967,76,2021-03-28 16:45:02,mf4jec
Anxiety,Does anyone else get anxious when receiving texts?,"I know this probably sounds strange but if I wake up and see unread messages I feel slightly panicked/anxious. Even innocent ""good morning"" or ""what you upto today?"" texts (even from the right people) can make me a little on edge. I don't know if it's just me... Am I overly sensitive or private? Or perhaps this is more common than I think.

P.S. Those multiple texters really stress me out. I hate seeing like five messages which could have easily been one... Am I the only one?","Texts, phone calls, replies to comments, emails. Yeah I get anxious even just waking up.",966,72,2021-12-05 02:38:09,r95j50

Anxiety,Does anyone ever start fearing for their sanity when anxiety gets unbearable?,"My biggest fear with my anxiety is losing my mind. Not being in control or going mad is the scariest possible scenario to me. Does anyone else feel this way?

EDIT: I just want to say thank you to everyone who has reached out, it’s comforting to know there are others who experience the same stuff, makes it less terrifying!! I am also so happy others can find reassurance through these comments so thank you all!! <3","Yes. Although I have had anxiety now for 20 years, and I am far less afraid of that now. I have been in and out of it so many times that I can recognize just how distorted my thinking can get during derealization and depersonalization. Its comforting to know though that you for sure aren't going crazy.",969,51,2021-03-09 15:15:30,m18ho2
Anxiety,I quit my six-figure job to recover,"This was possibly the hardest decision I’ve ever had to make. I’ve been at this job for 5 months now and the workload was immediately unmanageable for one person but I kept pushing through thinking I was just weak, I needed to work harder. After all this was an opportunity of a lifetime and others would kill to have this job!

It got to a point where my anxiety and depression was out of control. I dreaded work every morning and was crying 3 times a day every day for a month. I couldn’t stomach any food until dinner time. I wasn’t taking breaks and I was doing 12 hour days. Exercise was out of the question of course.

I knew I needed to quit but I felt like I couldn’t. I didn’t want to be that person that gives up. On top of that I felt incredibly guilty that if I did quit, my workload would be dumped on my boss and the team. I was (and still am) anxious about what people think of me. Do they think I’m a quitter?

All I was focused on was others and I forgot about me. How sad is that. 

The past week I managed to scrounge up the pieces of myself scattered across the floor and peel myself out of bed at 6:30 to run in the morning. I may have severe anxiety and depression but this is the one thing I can do for myself. 

I still have this nagging thought that I am crazy to throw away this salary but at the end of the day no amount of money is worth trading in my mental health for.

I don’t have a fully laid out plan of what I’m going to do but all I know is right now I need to heal and recover. Financially I am okay and my angel of a partner is supporting me in this.

I am by no means on the other side yet but I thought I would put this out into the world for anyone else who feels stuck in their job and afraid to quit. Feel free to DM.

UPDATE: Writing this update on 10 June 2022 (a week out from 1 year ago). Thank you to everyone that commented at the time. Your encouragement really helped me through a tough time. Over the past year I have consistently received private messages from people that have gone through or are currently going through the same situation.

At the time of my original post I felt so alone because I couldn’t find other people going through the same thing. I thought I would just be sending a rant into a black hole and it wouldn’t mean much but it has really been worth putting out there just to see how many people have reached out and the conversations that have come from it. 

As an update, I took 2 glorious months off and looking back, quitting was the best decision I ever made. I was ashamed and guilty for a while but I had the gift of TIME. To do things I wanted to do that had nothing to do with work and to heal. Of course I had incredible support so I could focus on building myself back up. I’m now back at work at a previous job (before the heinous one referred to above) and I’m doing well. I still have anxiety obviously but off anti-depressants now.

If you’re ever in the same broken state I was, I know that hesitation so well. I know its a tough decision but I still 100% recommend quitting. A career is not the entirety of life.","Glad you have changed path. Sounds like the job was not right for you. You made a hard decision. I’m proud of you.

Better to make less and have peace of mind then to remain in a state of constant anxiety.

Good luck!",964,75,2021-06-15 21:19:43,o0ovub

Anxiety,Anyone else getting really anxious with all the COVID restrictions lifting?,"I am slowly realizing where my anxiousness has come from over the last couple of days. I have been handling my anxiety quite well over the last few months after having figured out some of my major trigger. With numbers going down in my city, restaurants are opening back up and people want to meet and socialize I have felt much more anxious over the last few days. 

I got quite comfortable in my covid routing and bubble over the last year. It hasn't taken all of the anxiety away but reduced the social aspect by a lot (maybe not to my long term advantage though). 

I have vacation time planned in the next few weeks and just had an anxiety attack over planning on where to go/what to do for just a couple of days. Last year a friend and I planned to take a trip together, which we now had to cancel because I could not get vaccinated early enough. Now we want to spend the time together in some other way and while trying to find some options closer to home I realized what I have been so anxious about. Going out, meeting other people, stepping out of my routine and comfort zone. Its crazy. I used to thrive with travel and new cultures/people and today I caught myself hoping that guidelines won't be relaxed so that I have a good excuse to stay in my bubble.... 

I have honestly no idea what to do with this. I need to stay careful and take precautions for my physical health (pre-existing conditions) while I cannot neglect my mental health but am not sure if its better to just go for it or let my anxiety dictate my vacation plans and social life again.... 

How are you guys handling going back to some form of ""normal"" or ""before""?","I felt so anxious over a year ago when this all started. Then I got comfortable in my bubble. Restrictions lifting made me anxious, everything returning to normal makes me anxious, the thought of taking a vacation that I really need is making me anxious. On top of all that I’m doing my best to find a job before my unemployment is over, and I’m having no luck. I also have a soon to be five year old to send to school in September and that’s making me anxious as well…..so let’s just say I’m not  doing too well :(",957,69,2021-05-26 20:04:40,nlq59n

Anxiety,Job hunting when you have an anxiety disorder...,"I honestly feel like if there was one thing that could perfectly trigger my anxiety attacks and tick all of the boxes that trigger my panic attacks, it would be job hunting. And it has.

Questioning my overall self-worth? Check.

Questioning my few skills? Check.

Panicking at long job descriptions where the words blur together from said panic and nothing makes sense because my brain stops functioning as my heart palpitates and my hands shake? Check.

Feeling like an overall failure because I don’t qualify for/get rejected from a job? Check.

Becoming overstimulated and hyperventilating from the sheer amount of positions to scroll through? Check.

“They expect *all* 45 bulletpoints of this from me? I’m not capable, I’m just a jack of all trades, my brain would explode on a daily basis, I can’t do this.” Check. 

Re-doing my resume 35 times because it’s just never *perfect* enough? Check.

Not being able to decide what I want to do with my life and thus experiencing an overwhelming desire to just give up? Check.

Catastrophizing my situation, which then turns into full blown panic attacks on a weekly basis because I haven’t heard back from any jobs and thus being convinced I’ll be unemployed forever? Check.

Job hunting is a soul-sucking experience for everyone involved. At the same time, I’m convinced it’s one of the most unbearable experiences for people who struggle with GAD. Or at least it seems to be for me.

Typing this after waking up today to find myself finally recovering from two straight days of panic attacks coupled with some fabulous depressive episodes thrown in. I was knocked completely out of commission after a week of overworking myself with the job hunt, and spent two days crying, shaking, taking Ativan when needed, and feeling like “nothing will ever be okay again”.

*Sigh.*

Back at it.

**EDIT**: Wow. Came back to this post late in the day and didn’t realize how much it had been noticed. Thank you guys so much for the kind words, the advice, and the support- and for sharing your own relatable stories. I wish things were easier and I know we struggle like hell, but here’s to everyone who commented hopefully landing a job they love, despite all of this. Thanks again for all of the support and for making me feel *far* less alone in my thoughts/struggles. Even though a lot of the comments were you guys simply relating to what I wrote, that in and of itself was so helpful to hear (and I really wish nobody else had to feel this way...but there’s comfort in knowing I’m not alone). You’re all amazing humans. ❤️ (and thanks for the the awards!)",I can relate so much to this. I’ve been job hunting for over a year for my first job but now I’m almost 20 and still haven’t had one because even if I do get an interview I blow every single one from social anxiety.

Anxiety,Society treats those with anxiety like garbage,"I've seen how most people treat someone whose anxious. Society treats those who are anxious or timid like garbage, play things to troll and fuck with. It's not just young people who bully those who are anxious, there's a culture of not taking anxious people seriously, not at all trying to sympathize with reasons why they might be that way.

People are animals, if you show even the slightest nervousness they pounce, they double down and try to stress you more, or laugh at you, ect. I've seen this from young, middle aged and old, from people of all cultures and background, it's absolutely disgraceful.

Suicide rates don't surprise me at all.","Most people are insecure so once they find something they can shit on others for, they use it. It's a tactic that solely degenerates and selfish assholes use. No decent, content person would treat another like that. Unfortunately, mental health is a huge problem and people refuse to educate themselves and empathize with others. I wish society was better and more supportive.",945,53,2021-03-07 01:58:28,lzgm9i
Anxiety,Does anyone else intentionally act a bit dumber just to avoid having to talk too much in conversations?,"Sometimes maybe say if you were in a conversation with someone/people you’re not comfortable with and you will not offer your whole stance on a topic or even sometimes act like you know nothing (when you do) just to avoid to have to talk, or come off the wrong way

There are times where I will just say “why” but I know full well why, just so I can avoid offering anything else on the topic. 

Obviously I don’t know everything.. most of the time I don't know anything.. but when I do know something I'll just avoid speaking just for comfortability sake","Not quite the same, but I definitely find myself sometimes taking the path of least resistance. Depending on my mood, I'll often just tell people what I feel like they want to hear or whatever I feel will end their current line of inquiry. It's not something I really find myself doing online or with people I'm close to, but with the general public, I often just put on whatever ""mask"" if you will, that gets me through any situation with the least possible amount of ""conflict"".

Anxiety,I hate constantly feeling like someone is mad at me,"It’s so tiring to constantly worry and have to check with people if they are mad. It makes people feel like I make everything about myself. When in reality I just need to make sure nobody is upset. I have a constant need to be liked and loved. I know everybody pretty much wants these things. But I get sick and feel extremely horrible when I even get a slight hint that someone might be upset with me. It’s just so tiring. I hate it and I feel like I can never be completely normal. I’ve made immense progress but it’s never going to be normal again. I can’t stop feeling guilty for everything I’ve ever done. And when I confess to family members about my guilt they act like I’m worrying about nothing. 

I obsess over things that happened years ago. And can’t let them go ever. I just cannot stop obsessing over things that probably didn’t even involve me or that nobody remembers or cares about anymore. I’m tired of thoughts that I’m a horrible person. I’m just so tired of it. It gets old to never feel comfortable with myself. The only times I do is when I’m in a group of people having fun. And I’m able to make them laugh. Whenever I’m alone and that connection is gone I just panic.

At this point I’m worried that I must be high maintenance and just need a lot of attention. I just want people to like me. I literally cannot stand the thought of people hating me. And I know there’s gotta be people out there. I know and understand why people get upset at my guilty feelings and confessions. It’s just hard to stop. I feel like I need reassurance which is a short lasting fix.


Edit: I’m kinda thinking this might be because I’ve forgotten my anxiety meds for a few days. Uhhh whoops. Well im going to get back on track and see how that helps. But I’m so nervous I can’t stop hyper focusing on one situation and it’s been a year and it wasn’t even a big deal when it happened

What helps me calm down is my routine of checking if people have blocked me or not (nobody has blocked me so far) and window shopping on Mercari for squishmallows with factory errors.","You aren't high maintenance. You have anxiety. Your brain is lying to you, but you don't know that in the moment. I've been there. I thought those thoughts were normal. I thought it was normal to constantly think others were talking about me. I thought it was normal to relive conversations from years ago. I thought it was normal to constantly worry about whether my boyfriend (now husband) actually loved me.

The only thing that truly helped was medication. A daily med as well as a rescue med for anxiety attacks. The right meds and the right dosage made a world of difference for me. The vast majority of those thoughts stopped or were at least easier to manage. I'm currently off medication and doing well, but there is no shame in medication.",931,27,2021-07-25 02:57:31,or3og2

At first I was fine, I just did my best to stay home when I wasn’t at work. Since the fall things have slowly been getting worse, I’m constantly worried that any slight change in how I feel is covid-related, and I’m terrified of being the reason someone I care about dies of covid.

He was already sick with terminal cancer, so when he got it, he was gone within 3 days. I went into shock.

Anxiety,Please stop medication shaming,"This is a PSA to the anxiety community. It's bad enough when you get it from people who don't even understand the concept of having anxiety, it's 10x worse when it comes from people within the community who also suffer from anxiety disorders.

Goddamn I get it left and right from fellow anxiety sufferers the very moment I mention that I'm on medication. It always turns into preaching. You may think you're helping, but you're really not. There are many different preachy topics people get into, but the main sentiments are ""oh, you're just not strong enough and are weak and leaning on the meds because not using them would be too hard for you."" Or ""oh they're really bad for you if you keep taking those you're going to end up with dementia-cancer by the age of 30"" 

Fuck off. I experienced something traumatic. I was not able to handle it without the assistance of meds. Therapy alone did not cut it. Going for walks outside or whatever didn't help either, which some people smugly like to suggest. I was in so much fear that I literally disassociated from myself. Meds kept me from being hospitalized.

I got shit from my doctor and people on here (not this sub specifically I haven't commented here before). You're going to die horribly for being on those meds! be afraid! be scared! feel ashamed!

Well guess what, I found a fantastic therapist who completely understands my plight. In one of our first sessions when I told her that the meds saved my life and that therapy alone wouldn't have ever helped, she IMMEDIATELY agreed and was like ""oh yep definitely. It's too powerful of a reaction/feeling. I know."" She herself experienced some trauma from her past, and she told me that when she stopped drinking and was on an anti-anxiety med for her panic disorder someone smugly told her ""oh so you dropped one addiction for another."" Oh boy did I have some shared anger with her over that. 

I really don't care to hear anyone's ""help"" or ""advice"" when it comes to my choice to take medications. I don't want your shaming, or how you were able to overcome your issues without medication, good for you. I don't want to hear how bad it is for me health-wise. There's this holier-than-thou preachy mindset disguised as sympathy and I fucking hate it. OOooOOoo they're so bad for you! Guess what's also bad for me? Not eating or sleeping or fulfilling basic biological needs to survive due to fear. Hm. Wonder which is worse?

I would rather live a shorter happier life due to relief from my anxiety due to meds than live a long tortuous life because that's what people say I should do. My doctor was brutal to me about being on the meds until I said essentially that to her, and then she finally laid off. 

And addiction doesn't happen to everybody. I had someone lecture me on how this medication I was on was going to give me a full blown addiction until I told them that once I was doing better I just simply got off of them and was off of them for months. They sure didn't have anything to say to that. 

So bottom line, stop shaming people who choose medications, if you want to celebrate that you're so healthy and untainted by pharmaceuticals, go do it somewhere else. Not everyone is that lucky. Yes I'm bitter.

edit: to be clear all of this mostly comes from the fact that I take **benzos,** which are apparently a big no-no to many people. I'm not sure if I would have had the same experience from people if I were taking non-benzos. People really love to scare me about those. But they saved my life and continue to do so, so, *shrug.*","""What? You're taking antibiotics? You're not strong enough to fight that infection on your own.

Anxiety,I was just harassed in public,"This is why I hate going outside by myself. I simply went to get money out of a cash machine and in the parking lot there were a group of ‘men’ loitering outside their van. They started talking about my ass and how they couldn’t stop staring at it, like I was a meat product. I tried quickly to get money out of the machine and on my way out one of them slaps my ass. I felt so humiliated I ran home taking a longer route to avoid walking past them again. I want to cry. I am going out for a work meal and now I feel like I am dressed too provocatively and every person is going to think I’m a slut. I am wearing trousers and a crop top because of the hot weather. My anxiety is through the roof, I just want to curl up in bed and never go outside again.

Edit: thank you all for such supportive and kind messages. It’s so nice to be reminded that the world isn’t full of horrible people. It made me cry how supportive you all are. Thank you for the suggestions that I should report these people, once my head is clear I will definitely do something about it.

Anxiety,People don't understand what anxiety is,"People don't understand what the impact of an anxiety disorder really is.

I really wish i could explain just how it feels to have GAD. But i don't know how so i'm just going to write what we have to deal with which people never seem to understand.

Anxiety disorders do not mean we feel anxious once in a while, it means we have to actively work on ourselves every day to live a comfortable life.

We have to regulate our diet and cut out certain food ands drinks.

We have constant tight muscles and often develop injuries because of this, not only that but stress weakens the immune system.
There is many more health issues we have or can develop because anxiety isn't just mental, it often represents itself physically.

We are unable to work or go to school because the stress of sensory input is too much. 

We can't leave our house or do regular tasks that others consider to be normal. It's a learning progress for us and we need patience.

We can be stuck in anxiety spirals for months and have anxiety attacks so bad that we lose a lot of weight because we are unable to eat, sleep or function and have very bad symptoms like puking or fainting.

We can be triggered by any stressful event and lots of things hit way harder for us like physical pain.

I wish the medical world would put more focus on anxiety so we don't have to go to the ER 3 times in one week because our anxiety attacks are so bad we literally can't do anything.

Im so tired of the mistreatment of us and people not understanding, feeling like i can never be myself or feel ""normal"" again.

All wounds will heal with time but it sucks we have to go through this terrifying traumatic experience.","People with no anxiety disorders are really annoying some times because they just don’t get it, they say things like bro just relax, or I have anxiety too, I was having that exam and didn’t study and was really worried or stuff like that, they don’t get that I can’t relax because from the moment I wake up I feel like shit from anxiety, when they say just relax it drives me mad, like if I could just relax I would",912,67,2021-08-16 23:17:36,p5rmw7

I struggled with the idea of taking it because all the possible side effects had my hypochondriac mind on edge but when my dad asked me if I wanted to get it today I said yes on the spur of the moment, and then followed through.
I feel fine at the moment.

It’s for a members only beach and all day for 7 hours straight I’m processing fees and bookings, letting people in and out of the lake, adding new members, answering emails, phone calls, and instructing ground staff when needed. I don’t have time to take “official” breaks unless it’s not busy that day. If it is then I get almost no breaks from people. 

After two days in a row of work I’ve completely broken down crying and hyperventilating, does this happen to anyone else in highly social jobs?","I find social interactions pretty draining. Even the ones I enjoy. It’s not an anxiety thing for me, because I’m comfortable socializing, it’s just tiring. I always build time into my schedule  to decompress and recharge by myself.

You might be an introvert.

Working seven hours straight without breaks is also itself a challenge though.",903,58,2021-07-12 05:16:54,oikotc
Anxiety,"I have illness anxiety disorder, and failed to get my scheduled COVID-19 vaccine a few months ago. Yesterday I bit the bullet and got my first dose! Yayy!","I'm not an antivaxxer! I believe in modern medicine. 

I was always scared of getting the vaccine, because we don't know the long-term effects of it. And I was also scared of getting it with the medication combination I'm on for my bipolar disorder, because I didn't know how it could react. 

The first time I told myself I would get it if I stop taking my medications a week prior to clear it out of my system so I can get the vaccine all by itself. That was a huge mistake, because of my bipolar disorder I became very mentally unstable which also in turn exacerbated my anxiety. And so I failed to make the appointment. 

This time, I got the vaccine and ironically I wasn't on any medication at all because my doctor took me off one medication because of it not working, and also because I've been in a major depression the last two weeks I literally forgot to take the other of the two medications for a week straight. *yes!, really it's as simple as I forgot, I know it's bad*. 

So not only did I push through the anxiety of getting the vaccine, I also got what I wanted in that I got it without being on medication. *It wasn't on purpose I swear! Haha* 

My arm hurts like hell and I feel really lightheaded and dizzy today But otherwise I'm okay. 
However I am highly unstable, because I'm not on any medication and my doctor is gone for the next two weeks on vacation. Another psychiatrist at the clinic told me not to restart my meds until I see my psych. (after stopping lamotrigine for more than five consecutive days You can't just simply restart it, You have to retitrate up to the target dose again)

The pharmacist as well as the nurse at the vaccine site said it's okay for me to take my Ativan, a benzodiazepine, before and after getting the vaccine but I decided not to because I fear mixing it with the vaccine. 

So I am just pushing through the anxiety that the symptoms are giving me and I'm doing okay! 

But I'm super proud of myself for biting the bullet and getting the vaccine as I am much more scared of catching COVID-19 than I am of the vaccine.","I‘m proud of you & happy for you that you got vaccinated.

Just a quick heads up, if something interferes with medications (which is known) they always ask the patient before treatment/injection what medication is taken. For vaccines I never have been asked, so I’d assume there are no known risks.",902,25,2021-06-19 19:43:29,o3o6wb

Anxiety,Don’t trust your anxiety! Today I got proof it isn’t always right.,"Today I had to do a big presentation at work to some important people. I was quite anxious as I’m still fairly new-ish to the job and still feel like a huge imposter. I’ve also got a new manager who sat in on the presentation to check everything went okay. 
I did it and when I came out the other side my anxiety was telling me it went terribly. Though I tried not to show it, throughout the presentation, the anxiety was saying, “oh god, you’re bombing, end it so the audience can stop feeling awkward and embarrassed for you.” I was sure that my manager must be quite disappointed. I fully expected to get a call from her to go over what went wrong and how to improve. 

Instead, she copied me in to an email between her and her boss giving me a “shout out” because I handled the tough questions “like a pro, giving extremely confident and good answers.” She also added that at the end, the head of department of the client I was presenting to had said the presentation was “one of the best” he’d seen and he’d found it “extremely useful and insightful”. 

I feel like she and I were at totally different presentations but it just goes to show, your anxiety is not always right about the situation and your perception does not always align with everyone else’s. 
Ignore the anxiety voice and just keep on going!

UPDATE: Oh my gosh thank you so much for all the fantastically kind comments and for the awards! I honestly expected maybe 5 people to be interested in this! I’m glad my experience has resonated with so many people and I really hope it can be an encouraging little story to anyone who is battling with anxiety.

Anxiety,"I miss the days when I could relax, when my mind wasn't always searching for the next thing to be so overly nervous about","I hear so many friends talk about how middle school was awful for them, but I look back and remember it so fondly. Not because it was my ""glory days"" or anything like that, but because it was the last time I can remember being able to enjoy life as it comes, and to take things one moment at a time. Just being able to play video games and relax without my mind wandering to ultimately pointless things to be anxious about. Being able to enjoy my hobbies, being able to go out in public without thoughts consuming me about the judgement of every stranger that walks by. I miss the days of being able to do nothing productive, and not be wrought with guilt about it.

I'm 26 now. The best way I can put things is that on paper, my life looks pretty great. Anxiety makes things pretty tough a lot of the time, as I'm sure you can all empathize with. I'm sitting here right now at 1 pm on a Saturday; I don't have work today, all my chores are done, the apartment is spotless, and my grocery shopping is all done, yet just sitting around and wanting to have a lazy day is the hardest thing for me.

Every time I get the same feeling that I'm being annoying or bothering them.

I don't know what to do I'm too afraid to message old friends or just people in general.

Then there's the question ""Will they think I don't care about them?"" because of how little I message them and they don't know how hard it is for me to message them.

Am I just being a bitch? I can't bring myself to just message them, even though I want to.

Anyone got advice?","I struggled with this for a while too, until my therapist gave me a technique that completely relieved these thoughts for me.

Here's what she told me:

First, pick three or four characteristics that you would want people to describe you as. I chose supportive, kind, intelligent, and calm. Take your time and really reflect on what your ideal self would be like. Once you choose your words, think of these as your *objectives.* 

When you are socializing, all that is in your power is being the most \*your characteristics\* as you can. In your case, (I'll use my words for this example), you are afraid of reaching out to people, but if your message is kind, supportive, calm, and intelligent, then what more can you do? If you are being the best you can be, there is no reason to live up to other people's expectations of you. If they are actually bothered by you, then it is their issue, not yours. 

I personally struggled with replaying scenes of socializing with people in my head afterward, so I would use this to sort of grade myself - I would ask, ""was I as supportive as I could have been? How so?"" and then go through all of my characteristics.

I recommend putting little sticky notes around your house, or put a note on your phone to remind you of this. It took a little bit for me to actually accept that this is all that I can do, but now, I never worry about what other people think of me because I am simply trying to be the best version of myself, and if someone doesn't like that, then that is their burden, not mine, and it shouldn't be yours either.

I hope this helps :) and please ask for clarification if I didn't explain clearly enough!",877,30,2021-05-28 12:43:33,nmx0ru
