relationships,UPDATE: I (30F) caught my husband (31M) in an affair and I don’t know how to move forward.,"Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/i7wkqu/i_30f_caught_my_husband_31m_in_an_affair_and_i/

First of all, I just want to thank everyone here for the support I received following my first post back in August. At the time, it truly felt like my world was ending. It was important to me to make this update because I need to tell anyone who’s currently going through the same thing—IT GETS BETTER. You will get so much better. 

I had one conversation with my husband since everything happened—by his choice. It lasted maybe five minutes and was like talking to a robot. I know from others that he cries to people about how he ruined his life, but I have never once gotten an apology or the same show of regret. At this point, I don’t care. I know him and the other woman are still seeing each other and frankly, they deserve each other. Good for them. 

While I still feel angry occasionally, I no longer mourn what I once had. Instead, I’m so excited for the life I now get to live. I moved to a small walkable city and gave myself my dream apartment. It makes me so happy to see how I’ve decorated it and to just live in a cozy place instead of our old dreary house.  I was the breadwinner in our marriage, and he would make me feel awful about wanting to pay for nice meals or do fun things. Since moving here, I’ve done a ton of foodie fun stuff and don’t feel guilty. It’s so refreshing. 

I have dipped my toe into the dating pool again and had plenty of mediocre dates from dating apps. Recently, I found someone who I’ve really clicked with and am enjoying how appreciated and desired he’s made me feel.  It’s definitely early and we’re moving slow, but overall, dating has made me realize that I’m a catch who doesn’t have to settle. 

Therapy has done wonders and I’m so happy I immediately dove into it. My therapist is proud of me. I’m proud of me. I’ve stopped looking at being divorced as a failure. He failed—not me. I’m genuinely happy and excited to wake up each morning and no longer feel like this terrible weight is sitting on my chest. The holidays were surprisingly easy and I found myself so happy to spend time with my family without having to compromise anything. 

So all in all, life is good and there’s so much of it ahead. Looking back, I can’t believe I wasted so much time thinking about how I could get him to come home. I’ve made my own home and my own happiness and that is worth so so much more. 

TLDR; Husband left me for another woman. He sucks, but things get better.","THIS MAKES ME SO HAPPY. GOOD FOR YOU, OP!! You rock.",16033,243,2021-01-04 23:09:07,kqkj9c

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/lqpshq/me_36_m_married_to_my_wife_36_f_11_years_and_i/

So I mentioned to my wife vaguely that I was having a bit of a midlife crisis and ruminating on my past a bit too much. That I miss how I was physically at my peak in college. 

She said she is also having a bit of a crisis, worried about longterm health and missing the shape she was in before kids. 

We made a commitment to each other to get into shape and have changed our eating habits and bought a treadmill. I have been working out daily and my rumination issues have really dwindled. We also planned a nice vacation, and a few get togethers with frends in the next few months.

**tl;dr**: Told wife I was having a crisis without much detail. We are making strides to better ourselves and each other.","That’s a great update. I can promise you that the one month relationship would have never worked out, because it didn’t. And how it ended suggests that it never had staying power. 

I hope that getting into shape helps you both. I think the pandemic also makes relationships tough because you’re likely no longer getting out and doing the things that brought you together (or, simply having time apart and separate interests). At least that’s been the case with my marriage! I think that would make it tempting to fantasize about some other reality that “could have” been (but really, it could have never been).",11421,109,2021-03-04 16:46:03,lxp1ee

I found the perspectives and guidance I received really helpful. I decided to just spend some time with her. She loves to bake and we baked together and we had some movie nights. her comments melted away and she became happier. 

we were baking yesterday when she came out to me. I didn't make a big deal out of as I felt she didn't want me to. I just told her I loved her before continuing to bake as if nothing happened. We did have a conversation later on. 

She told me that she and her friend had been together ( scary, how well kids can hide things.) Her girlfriend wanted to come out but she didn't and it had strained their relationship. It seems, they had a fight before we gave her the books to her (ex?) girlfriend and that had hurt her. Their relationship is in the limbo and she doesn't want to come out to the world right now. My husband ordered a small pride flag to keep in her room. The world is a bit crazy right now and we want her to have a space where she can be herself.

Well, turns out my gut instincts were right. The entire time he was begging for another chance and promising “this time would be different” (eye-roll) he was still sleeping with the affair partner and telling him he loved her and would do anything to make it work with her. It didn’t even hurt me to find it out. I was THAT unsurprised. It just helped me stop feeling guilty. I divorced his ass. 

 I thank the universe every day that he is no longer connected to me in a romantic way. It feels like an ENORMOUS weight has been lifted off my shoulders. 

Shortly after my original post I met someone by chance at a wedding and fell in love. This person is everything my ex husband was not. The kindness, compassion, and respect they show not just me, but to my daughter as well, is like something from a dream. I never knew love could be so easy. 

To anyone in a loveless marriage reading this-LEAVE. Do the hard thing- ESPECIALLY if they have a pattern of leaving/returning/cheating, etc. Lord knows I was terrified to cut the cord. At one point in time I was actually starting to feel bad for the guy because he was begging me every single day for another chance. He tried to convince me that getting a divorce would ruin my future, our daughters future, that she would come from a “broken family”- but it was the exact opposite. It was broken already and I fixed it. Once I made up my mind that divorce was the best option, I absolutely thrived. I learned independence. I found how to be happy on my own. I found happiness in a partner. Life has never been so sweet. The bad shit makes the good shit so much better. Thank you, Reddit, for the support on my original post. It helped turn my graveyard into a garden.

relationships,"Update to Nightmare Situation: Me(35F) with Partner(40M), my son and his nephew (15Ms)","Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/nb1jcp/nightmare\_situation\_me35f\_with\_partner40m\_my\_son/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/nb1jcp/nightmare_situation_me35f_with_partner40m_my_son/)

Hi again everyone. I posted about my family problem about a month ago and was bowled over by the amount of kind and extremely helpful comments I got. Someone requested an update, so I'm posting now to tell you what's happened since. To be honest it's also to unburden myself, the boys are really sweet but I obviously can't talk to them about these things and there aren't a lot of people in my life I feel comfortable sharing all the details with. I suppose I'm embarrassed.

The week after my original post, I met with a family lawyer I know to go over options. I actually wrote down the legal suggestions posted here to discuss with her, but unfortunately, after going over each and several others in detail, we had to conclude that for each one, while it might technically be feasible, it would either take too long to be practical, or require things from Bob or from Ben which for various reasons were not ideal. Following the meeting, I was mulling things over and decided to take a long hard look at our finances to see what might be affordable as a compromise, such as perhaps sending Ben to a GOOD boarding school and pay tuition up front, so that if I then left Bob it would be easier and cheaper for him to leave Ben there rather than move him to a different school.

Anyway, I went over our financial records with a fine-toothed comb, and that's when I discovered Bob was cheating on me, and had been for the entirety of our relationship. It turns out that, prior to Ben's parents' death, Bob had been about to move in with another woman. This woman didn't want kids, so when Bob was suddenly faced with taking custody of Ben or seeing him placed in foster care, she made it clear she would not be involved (for the record I can't say I blame her - I love my boys with all my heart, but asking someone who never wanted kids to parent a bereaved 11 year old she has never met is not in anyone's best interests in my opinion). When I confronted him about the affair, he didn't even attempt to deny it. He seemed ashamed (good!!) and just asked what happened next, so I told him that next he was going to get his stuff and get out of my house, but first ask Ben if he wants to go or stay, because it wouldn't be fair to disrupt the poor kid's life any further. Ben quickly said he preferred to stay, and Bob seemed frankly relieved. He moved out that weekend and I haven't seen him since. We've been in touch by text to discuss financial arrangements, though, and last week he sent me money to cover Ben's basic expenses (nothing like as much as child support, but under the circumstances I'll take it and be glad). From his attitude I take it that he's seeing this as a longterm thing, but even he doesn't, according to the family lawyer, his leaving Ben with me even for a while, along with Ben's age and the fact that Bob is his guardian rather than his father, would make it easier to build a case for Ben to stay even if Bob does try to fight it. The lawyer is confident that such a battle could be won, or at least dragged out till Ben is 18 and it doesn't matter anymore. So that, as you can imagine, has been an enormous relief.

That makes it that much harder to admit that finding out about Bob has still hit me hard. The fact is that, even though I was absolutely done with him and wanted him out, there was a time I truly believed he wanted to be with me and that we could build a life together. I knew our relationship wasn't a romance for the ages or anything like that, but it was by far the best I'd had since before my son was born and I really thought we cared for and valued one another. Now I realise that all he ever wanted from me was a mother for Ben. He as good as admitted it, and in retrospect it makes complete sense. That's why he never wanted to get married or buy into my house even though I offered (though now of course I am grateful!), because he wanted to make it as easy as possible to split from me once Ben was old enough to no longer require my services. I think it might even explain why he was so hard on Ben and grasping at straws for a reason to send him away. I never expected it of him based on what else I knew or I never would have been with him, but if he was blaming Ben for getting in the way of his life and simultaneously feeling guilty for, that could turn a mild-mannered person mean I think. Maybe he even thought if Ben was away most of the time the other woman would be willing to compromise for a few years? I don't know. I've even been wondering whether he decided to pursue me before we'd even met (the boys met first through an extracurricular where they became friends. It's possible that Jason mentioned my being single in passing, allowing Bob to identify me as potentially 'suitable' before we ever met).

I'm sorry this is such a mopey post, I truly am grateful for the way things worked out, I think it's the best possible solution for everyone under the circumstances, and not one I could have achieved without Bob's 'help'. And the boys have been wonderful, they didn't know I was trying to get Bob out anyway so they've been treating me very gently (or as gently as you can expect teenage boys to be, anyway) and trying to pretend they aren't thrilled Bob is gone when I'm in the room. I'm glad of that, to be honest. I AM so grateful he's gone and Ben is still safe here with us, I just need a bit of time to really remember it, I think.

TL;DR: It turns out Bob has been cheating on me most likely for the entire duration of our relationship. He's moved out and left Ben with me.",You are one heck of a mum and an even better person. Ben and Jason are lucky to have you 👏,6379,143,2021-06-20 18:47:10,o4c6y1
relationships,UPDATE My girlfriend (25F) has not texted me (25M) in 2+ days,"Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/q042yp/my\_girlfriend\_25f\_has\_not\_texted\_me\_25m\_in\_over\_2/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/q042yp/my_girlfriend_25f_has_not_texted_me_25m_in_over_2/)

So... let's just say the outcome is not good. I would have rather anything else happened but this.

She was in a bad car crash.

Her sister had my old phone number (I changed phones a couple months ago) so I did not receive any of her calls. And when I texted/called her, they just went to spam. So, she messaged me on LinkedIn.

She told me that my girlfriend was in a car crash and is in the hospital right now. She was in and out of consciousness for about 3.5ish days. My girlfriend just woke up and became somewhat alert this morning. I called her and she seemed like her normal joking self - she told me to sell our shiba inu coins that we bought as a joke.

Her sister said my girlfriend said she can't feel her legs so the doctors are going to do scans and tests. But other than some scratches/bruises and some sore spots, she has a sprained wrist. I saw the pictures and its a miracle she is not dead. The car is gone. I liked that car, it was a nice car.

I am flying out tomorrow morning to visit her.

I am just in shock. I don't know what to think.

TL;DR - Her sister messaged me and my girlfriend was in a bad car crash.","That's awful!  Best of luck to the two of you, and hopefully she makes a full recovery.

Tl;dr of last post: Due to coming off some long term medication, I have a sex drive for the first time in about 10 years. Realized I have no idea how to hit on my husband or initiate in general.

My last post didn't get a ton of attention, but I thought I would update people anyways. I took most everyone's advice and talked to my husband. He thought the whole situation was hilarious (in a nice way). But he was very reassuring. I told him about my fears of rejection, or doing something wrong. How my body issues have made it difficult to initiate because I fear I wont be able to turn him on. He gave me some ideas on how I might come on to him, what subtle moves might work to help initiate. He also reassured me that unless something major was going or he was sick, he would pretty much always reciprocate. He soothed my body fears and told me he finds me very attractive and I shouldn't worry about that. 

You guys, this has been life changing. Talking with my husband completely alleviated my fears. After a couple of false starts, I was able to start initiating. And its been going great. We're both all over each other all the time, just like we were highschoolers again. Maybe even better. Thank you so much everyone for convincing me to just talk to my husband.

relationships,UPDATE My best friend [22F] is giving up a full-ride scholarship to be with her boyfriend of >3 months,"https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7awaf0/my_best_friend_22f_is_giving_up_a_fullride/

Just found this throwaway account and thought I should give an update! My friend and I are now 25, and we’re still close. She did transfer schools and lose her scholarship. She also graduated late because of the transfer. In all, it cost her more than $30k in student loans, which she regrets.

Things did not work out between her and her boyfriend. He really wanted to live a party boy lifestyle with her at home to cook and clean up after him. They broke up one year after she transferred. She still had a semester left, which was really difficult and lonely because she had no friends aside from him and his social circle.

After graduation, she got a job as a teacher in her hometown. So she does have a way to pay back the loans! She’s pretty happy. She’s now engaged to a different guy she started dating ~2 years ago. They got together right after she moved home. Yes, it’s fast, but they live together with no issues. They aren’t going to start planning a wedding until COVID eases up. She’s less gullible now and more skeptical of her mom’s advice. Her experience really opened her eyes to the consequences of her choices.

TL;DR My friend learned an expensive lesson, but her life turned out okay. She ended up where she probably would have if she didn’t transfer, but $30k in a hole. She’ll be the first to tell you to prioritize your future over a short-term relationship!","Im glad it all worked for her, but that last comment made me laugh too hard.

relationships,UPDATE - My (27F) boyfriend (28M) is obsessed with my ex (27M).,"[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/k9c84u/my_27f_boyfriend_28m_is_obsessed_with_my_ex_27m/)

After my last post, I tried to take the advice in the comments and suggested couples counselling and I asked my boyfriend to cut off my ex, but he got angry at me again. He claimed I was the one who needed therapy because I had jealousy issues, and that my ex was one of his good buddies and I couldn’t dictate who he was friends with. 

Then a week later he had another hangout with my ex and his friends where he proceeded to very loudly tell them how I was so insecure, and I was trying to tell him who he could speak to. My ex and Luke had to tell him to stop which he didn’t like at all. I should’ve just broken up with him at this point, but I was stupid and still clinging to the hope of my boyfriend going back to how he was. After this happened, my boyfriend was constantly making jabs at my ex and Luke but then he would still contact them and pretend to be friends with them. 

Then, he became super interested in what my sex life was like with my ex. He was constantly asking me who was better between the two of them and he would ask me if I had done this or that with my ex. I kept telling him I didn’t want to talk about it and to stop asking me. I then find out from my ex and Luke that he had been asking my ex directly the same questions and that he had been bragging about our sex life to his friends. My ex said he was telling me because my boyfriend made a comment about loaning me to my ex if he ever felt like recreating old times. That was the final straw for me, and I broke up with him and moved out. 

My now ex-boyfriend didn’t take the breakup well and he went on a smear campaign. He even contacted my family and my ex’s family to tell them we were apparently having an affair and that he had no choice but to break up with me. It’s been almost a month since we broke up and he keeps getting new numbers to text and call me.

Deep down I think I knew this would be how things ended. I’m sad about the relationship I thought we had ending but now that I’ve had space away from my ex-boyfriend, I feel much better and it's like a huge weight has been lifted from my shoulders.

TL;DR – My boyfriend wasn’t willing to work on the relationship and he kept doing things to embarrass/upset me so I finally broke up with him.",This dude is nuts. Leave and don't ever look back.. seriously...,6089,132,2021-03-12 16:24:56,m3l3uh

TL;DR: 5 years ago, my girlfriend was really close with this guy. It made me feel terrible. I brought it up with her and here's what happened.

I brought up the topic and she was super cool about it. She was surprised and she said that it was just friendship on her side. However, she went up to the guy and asked him if he saw things the same way. He said he didn't -- he was actually into her. So, she told him that she's with me and that they need to stop hanging out. It was never an issue after that -- we still met him at a few parties, but it didn't make me feel bad at all.

Reading the old post made me smile. It felt like a big issue back then, but she solved it so swiftly. I'm really thankful to her! We've had the most wonderful relationship since then (and even before then). We're 33 years old now and still going strong together. We moved in together a couple of years ago and it's been amazing living together, traveling together, being together all the time. She's still so sweet, I love her with the bottom of my heart, and it's obvious she loves me too.

You never know how these things will turn out, but ours is a story to fill your hearts with hope and love!

After reading the comments I decided to just bring it up with him without telling him what I want him to do, to avoid sounding controlling.

I sat him down and told him that some of the stuff that she says really makes me uncomfortable. I told him that I feel like she's undermining our relationship. I gave him a few examples of the stuff she said and done that I didn't appreciate. He still doesn't think she's into him. He's convinced that she's acting this way because she probably feels like they're drifting apart as friends because he's in a serious relationship now. Which frustrated me a little tbh because its clear to me that she wants him but being subtle about it.

He said that regardless of her intentions, if her actions are making me uncomfortable. He'll have a talk with her about it. I was really happy he said that, because I was really nervous and anxious to see how he'll react. I was afraid he'll take her side.

He can be a dummy sometimes so I was worried that he'd bring it up with her in the wrong way. Like saying ""my girlfriend doesnt want us talking anymore"" and stuff like that but he nailed it. He told her in a text ""Dude, I noticed some of the stuff you've been saying in front of my girlfriend lately and I've been wanting to talk to you about it. It's mad disrespectful and uncomfortable. We're cool, but just stop that s\*\*t"". Naturally, she acted all innocent and confused. She was like ""what? you know I'd never do anything that would upset you"" ""I think you're misunderstanding"" and stuff like that. He doubled down on it though.

I could tell he felt somewhat guilty telling her off like that and I don't know if he's convinced that she's trying to undermine our relationship or not, but I'm so glad that he had my back in this. I'm honestly kind of glad this whole thing happened. It gave me a better idea of what kind of man he really is. He even said he'll stop hanging out with her alone if it makes me feel uncomfortable. He was also, lowkey mad at me for waiting this long to tell him I was uncomfortable around her.

Safe to say that the best possible outcome happened. He really put her in her place and ngl it made me feel real good. All I could think of was ""I WON!!!"" lmao. Thanks to everyone for encouraging me to tell him because even though I knew that's what I should have done I was still scared to do it for some reason. I even thought about potentially just avoiding her for good. Which sounds ridiculous now that I think about it, because I shouldn't have to hide from her. I guess I'm just not good at confrontations.

Thanks for the helpful advice everyone.

TLDR: I told my boyfriend that his friend's actions were making me uncomfortable because she's clearly into him and she's undermining our relationship. He let her know that she has to stop and totally had my back during the whole thing. All and all everything turned out pretty great.

relationships,"(5 year update) Me [44 M] with my sister [50 F], 44 years duration, got a painful message from her regarding my professional behavior as a substitute k-12 teacher and don't know how to respond (long)","The front page r/askreddit thread inspired me to follow up here. [Here's my original post from five years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3fnzui/me_35_m_with_my_sister_42_f_siblings_for_35_years/).

The discussion was really helpful, and at one point I had my therapist read that thread. Thanks to everyone who chimed in. 

Since that post, I have not been in contact with my sister, except for incidentally at a few family events, where we had minimal interaction. My other family is conflicted, but they seem to understand that neither of us wants to be in each others' lives any more, despite them wanting us both in theirs.

I've worked on this issue specifically in therapy, which has helped me develop some insight into those messages. Next year I will be as old as my sister was when she wrote me those abusive messages (there were a few followup messages I didn't include in the original post.)

I don't regret cutting her out. I do regret having had a toxic person for a sibling. Looking back I recognized that her over the top email was part of a few lifelong behavioral patterns. I realized that basically, despite our biological similarities and having been raised in the same household, we are simply not compatible people.

I hope one day she will develop her own insight, recognize her abusive behavior patterns, and reach out to try to repair or reestablish a relationship with me. But I'm not holding my breath for this to happen, and I'm not interested in reaching out to ask her if she'll consider trying to improve things. Not having her in my life in the years since has actually improved the quality of my life: there's been a lot of unnecessary drama and hard feelings that I'd been used to having to handle that I simply don't with her gone.

At this point I anticipate only seeing her at a few more funerals. Would have been nice to have a good relationship with a sibling, but I do not have that with her and I don't believe I ever will.

relationships,Update: I (28M) messed up by asking my girlfriend (26F) to stop talking about her late boyfriend," [Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/n9q8k4/i_28m_messed_up_by_asking_my_girlfriend_26f_to/)

  
All the comments here helped me understand that we needed to talk about the issue but she was still a bit mad at me. I thought I should just give her space for a few days. I think a day or two after It was announced that I was being promoted. Some of  my colleagues hosted a little after work dinner for me as I would be moving divisions and not working with them anymore. It was nice and It really touched me and it also made me understand how fucked our relationship had become. I got what the comments meant but I guess actually having a nice dinner celebrating my success felt great and made me truly understand how unhappy I felt. 

we had the talk a few days later. I told her that I felt unhappy and unappreciated. That I felt like I needed some time away from her. She almost seemed like she was waiting for this. she didn't seem particularly upset over it. She said she understood and she would move back to her parents as soon as possible. I know it is ugly but some part of me wanted her to be upset. some proof that she cared for me? I don't know. I feel like she didn't love me at all. I feel like I wasted years being in love with her. 

She moved out two weeks ago and I miss her a lot. Home feels really lonely without her but at the same time I feel better. Not a lot but I feel a bit better about myself. It is strange. 

She is not a bad person. she is a wonderful person and that is why I fell in love with her but the closer we got the less happy our relationship made me. I know a lot of it was my fault and I need to work on communication skills.  


 TL;DR : I realized how profoundly unhappy our relationship made me and broke up with her.",[deleted],5641,148,2021-06-02 08:56:06,nqhc9l
relationships,Update : I (32F) snooped on my husband's (33M) phone and found out he is bi,"[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/nnlyha/i_32f_snooped_on_my_husbands_33m_phone_and_found/)

I did not expect so many responses and I was a bit confused on what to do but I guess most people in the community was telling me to give him space to process it himself and come out on his own terms.  I took the advice to be generally supportive of the lGBTQA community without being obvious about it. I also spend some time reading about bisexuality. 

I did post a story on June 1 but the best thing that happened was that his friend came out as bi herself. We follow each other on Instagram and she had made a post about it. I made a comment congratulating her and wishing her well. She did text me about a dinner and  while we were   
 chatting she thanked me for my support and this wonderful woman gave me an another opportunity to express my support and do it in more personal way than a comment. 

He came out to me about a week ago. He was very nervous and still scared and all I wanted to do was tell me that I knew but from what I have read letting people do it on their own terms were really important. He told me, nothing would change. He just wanted me to know and he didn't want to hide a part of himself. It was okay. I told him nothing had to change. He was the perfect man for me and I loved him no matter what. 

He did ask me later if I knew and I came clean. I told him I saw. Apologized for it and cried a lot. He was upset but understanding. He even apologized for suddenly changing his behavior which is bullshit as I should have dealt with it a lot more maturely. it just hit just right spot of insecurity for me.

Things are fine. He is happier and we are getting back to our old routines. 

 TL;DR:  He came out. I confessed to snooping and things are okay.","Straight spouse with a bi husband here as well. Glad you had such a good resolution! I completely understand why you feel/felt insecure, but at the end of the day it's about trusting your partner in the same way that you would if they were straight.",5577,46,2021-06-15 11:11:50,o0buhm
relationships,UPDATE: I (24m) cannot stand my boyfriend’s roommate’s (26f) dog and I’m trying to understand why and get past it,"[Here is the original post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/kfhw2j/i_24m_cannot_stand_my_boyfriends_roommates_26f/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

My first post didn’t get the most attention, but there was been a major recent event that made me think it was time to post an update. 

His roommate went away for the weekend (Valentine’s Day weekend!) and it fell on us to take care of the dog. I, obviously, was not too excited to be having to schedule my Valentine’s Day weekend around this dog’s needs, but was willing to do so to have a weekend alone with my boyfriend.

Well, much to my surprise, the dog is a total sweetheart! When her owner is not around, she barely raises her voice, sleeps most of the day, and is extremely easy to care for! It would appear that it is really stuff like the incessant baby talking that *actually* bothers me, not the dog itself.

Through observation, as well, I’ve realized that the dog only barks and whines because she knows she’ll get attention or food *from her owner* whenever she wants. My boyfriend has very cleverly trained the dog to know that that doesn’t work on anyone else. So no begging from us!

So now I ignore the roommate’s dealings with the dog, love the dog herself, and let my boyfriend’s roommate deal with the worst parts of owning an old dog and just enjoy a buddy to watch tv with when shes not around.

Win win! Thank you everyone for all the great advice.

TL/DR: Dog doesn’t suck! Roommate still sucks at raising the dog but its much easier to ignore now because the dog is so great!",Lol I love this post cause it pretty much explains all problems with dogs it’s mostly the owner and not the dog itself,5467,53,2021-02-23 08:37:29,lqdjmb
relationships,"I(17f) told dad about mom's affair to save him from a terrible marriage, now he wants a paternity test and I don't know what to do.","When I was about 9 years old, I realized my mom was having an affair for years on my military dad.  I did not say anything as I was really worried what would happen if I said anything. When I was about 12 years old, I found my dad looking at pictures of our family and tearing up and I couldn't take it and I told him about moms affair. Fastforward 5 years and I live full time with dad and his new wife and step sister and our lives have improved so much since leaving mom. 

Well grandpa on dad's side has been pressuring my dad to get a paternity test as he wants to make sure that ""I am his grand daughter"". This is getting really intense as grandpa may pass away soon and he says he doesn't know if he should leave us anything if he doesn't even know...

Well my dad has resisted this for years and saying it doesn't matter. But now things have changed as I have half sibling on the way. I am totally happy and fine with this, but for some reason my dad has started to change his mind about the paternity dna test thing. He says he is worried that I won't receive help with my college or anything, but im worried he is wondering if he should care about me or just my new sibling.

I am not sure how much money my grandpa has, but he does have a big house and a lot of property so I guess it's important. I would rather just continue with our relationship how it is... but I don't know what to do now and i haven't been able to sleep over this.

What do you think I should do?

TlDR: dad says we should get paternity test for me, but im worried he won't love me if it goes wrong.","Oh babe, this must be really hard for you and I'm sorry you're going through this. 

There is nothing you can do, this is your father's decision. It sounds to me as though your father didn't care about the test and loves you unconditionally. It sounds like your grandfather on the other hand may have some other, dated, notions.

Sit down with your father and tell him exactly what is on your mind - read him your tl/dr. Express your love for him, stepmom, step- and half-siblings. Just tell him you're scared and ask what he thinks. 

Good luck, OP. It's going to be ok 💛",5263,164,2021-04-30 19:26:28,n21e9c
relationships,UPDATE: My Girlfriend wants to take a stressful job and I foolishly set an ultimatum against it," [Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/mrah04/my_girlfriend_wants_to_take_a_stressful_job_and_i/)

I (27M) would like to thank everyone who took time to give me valuable advice, it helped me realize I was going about it the wrong way and possibly ruined a relationship of 7 years . Yesterday, we sat down and had a proper conversation. I apologized to her for lashing out with an ultimatum, I explained how scared I was of things sliding back. She (28F) was able to understand it and she also pointed out how hurtful me setting down and ultimatum was. I talked about mapping out a plan so that we don't slid into the mess we had created.

I think me being open to the idea of her working allowed her to be vulnerable and reveal why she wanted to chase money. She wants to put down roots in the city and buy a house here. she grow up in pretty unstable circumstance and moved around a lot. She is adamant that we own a house before we get married/have kids and the home market here is booming. She also thought that it was a bit embarrassing to be so fixated on owning a house and wanted to take the whole burden on herself. I really love this woman. I know that her actions in the past has not been great but even after that I trust her to be kind.

I think, this perspective is not something I could have ever thought of , I come from a more privileged background and even though my parents raised us to be independent but we always knew that if things got ugly, we had a safety net. She never had that and I understand her need to create one. After we stopped crying and talking. we went through the budget and talked about areas where we could cut expenses.

She really doesn't want to change jobs, so we are planning on her asking for a raise and I think I will start looking for a new job. I am pretty indifferent about my workplace and I don't mind jumping ship to increase my salary. She is happy and would have disliked to move to another company.

I have to really thank the people here for helping us talk this out. I am planning on bringing up counselling on a later date. we have a lingering issue on communication that we need to sort out.

Tl;DR: we talked it out and I found out what she wanted and she was worried about money. We made a plan to fix it.","So happy the two of you were able to be open and communicate with each other about this! 

Please make sure you continue this communication and have an action plan in case your lives take a separate turn from each other as you pursue this serious joint purchase.",5185,29,2021-04-17 19:19:22,msx4sa

My post didn't get a lot of attention but some people did provide me with really good feedback and this is a happy update!

I decided to to keep my feelings to myself and understand if it was just my gratitude and learn about myself in that time. I read a few books and I did some introspection. I have always liked girls. In hindsight, it is pretty obvious why I hated seeing my best friend with her boyfriend. haha. I brushed those feelings aside as just jealousy for how good their relationship was. Teenage me was pretty dumb.

I also realized that my roommate was probably asexual. I have know her for a long time and she has not dated one single person. Never brought a person home. It made me feel hopeless about my feelings for her.

I came out to her about a month ago. I had left one of my books laying around and she handed it back to me. I made a bad joke. I ended up explaining that I think I am bi. It was pretty awkward. She told me she was into girls but she thinks she is a demisexual and it takes her lot to form the emotional bond needed to be ready to have sex. I probably made a mess of the conversation. I thought there was no way she would for such bond with me.

She ended up asking me out while we were cooking dinner last week. I was pretty surprised honestly. It is scary and a bit awkward moving from being roommates to girlfriend. Scary as hell but even with all the uncertainty about if we could work. I feel incredibly comfortable around her. I can be myself and I know she won't judge me and she loves it.

TLDR: I came out. she asked me out. starting a new relationship.","*and they were roommates!*

relationships,UPDATE: My coworker [45M] often interjects his opinion on my [27F] soon-to-be wedding.,"[Original Post](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/lk3bta/my_coworker_45m_often_interjects_his_opinion_on/)

Hello, thank you all for the comments!! I know it's been almost 2 weeks since my last post. Some of y'all offered some great advice...again, thank you. So here's what happened since my last post. 

I went back to work the next day and Jack was off...it was blissful. I didn't see him the rest of the week because he went back to Montana to see some family. I only knew his whereabouts because another coworker felt the need to inform me... 

Anywho, Jack gets back that weekend and on Monday he runs into me as we clock in. Immediately he begins to describe Montana...his sister was getting married in a small wedding...the colors...the flowers. I express my congratulations to his sister and start heading to my department. We don't see each other until lunch break.

I'm sitting down enjoying my leftovers when Jack comes over and starts in on what he has in mind for my wedding, even so far as mentioning price brackets. I put up my hand and tell him to stop. I tell him that my fiancé and I are doing a courthouse wedding, it may not be romantic in his eyes, but it's what we want to do and what we are looking forward to doing. I also told him that he needs to drop the subject as we are not changing our minds.

He starts apologizing and saying that he didn't realize that I was serious about the courthouse. I just shook my head and told Jack again to stop talking about it before I walked away from him.

Yesterday I heard from another coworker that Jack was upset and didn't mean to cross lines with me. At this point I don't care. I said my piece and am super happy that I stood my ground. I will keep doing this too because it feels good to not be a doormat. I should've done this sooner! Thank you again. 

**tl;dr**: Jack went on vacation, came back, and started his usual spiel. I stood my ground and it felt pretty damn good.","in my early 20s i really became aware that i had a problem with confrontation (never wanted to insult anyone, always tried to get out of uncomfortable positions by making a joke out of it etc.) and i promised myself that the next time i found myself in that position i would put my foot down no matter how unsettling it felt. i can't even remember now what the 'next situation' was, but i followed thru with my promise to myself and the RUSH of adrenalin i got from doing that convinced me to never go back to the way i was. i still falter sometimes, but for the most part i've gotten really good at standing firm. it's a great feeling. i'm happy you did it as well! congrats on your now stress free wedding!",4887,29,2021-02-28 02:11:49,lu2z2g

I received a lot of great advice from the people here. I decided to come out to my sister in law. She took it really well and was very supportive. She suggested that she was going over that week and she reassured me that they would be mostly fine. she told me about the time when they thought she was queer and they tried to support her in their misguided but still loving way which is hilarious but also endearing. 

When she visited them she apparently laid down hints that I wanted to introduce my partner but I was scared about how they would react and that they should try to be calm. They reassured her that they would try to be cool. 

I visited last week. It was awkward and they were waiting for me to say something but I was feeling incredibly scared. I told them that I had a girlfriend. I was in love with her. we were about to move in together and I wanted them to meet her. They were quiet for a moment. I panicked and told them that I was attracted to men and women and that dating a woman didn't mean what I had with my husband was not real. 

They told me that as long as I am happy and I was with someone nice. it didn't matter to them who I dated. They want to meet her. It feels like a huge burden has been lifted from my back. I am out to all the people that matter to me now. It is amazing. 

we can only visit them next month as my girlfriend is incredibly busy with work. She is really excited to meet my family. I know they are too. I feel really lucky to have all this wonderful people in my life.

Long story short, he is an ex-boyfriend now. I did some thinking and decided to break things off so I broke up with him over text. He tried to explain himself. He said he panicked when he saw me and didn't know what to do but I didn't think I could get past that incident. He begged me to take him back, but all his efforts were in vain.

relationships,UPDATE: M27 boyfriend won’t talk about the future with me (27F),"Hi guys, I just wanted to thank you all for your love, advice, and support regarding my last post. I woke up yesterday morning and told my boyfriend that either we’re going to have a serious adult conversation about the future right now, or you can pick a time later today. After a bit of back and forth, he picked 5pm. At 5, we sat down on the couch and discussed each of our goals regarding marriage, children, employment, etc. We also discussed concerns that each of us had, I started out with mine and then I think that helped him voice his concerns, the largest of which involved my family (they are complicated). I think me forcing the scheduling of a time to talk helped him open up about his concerns.
No, I don’t have a ring on my finger yet, but my goal was to get him to open up about why he didn’t want to discuss it. We ended up talking for about 2 hours and I made clear my timeline requirements and he agreed. I feel like we’re in a good place now. Thanks again for all the love and support ❤️

TL;DR finally got my boyfriend to talk to me about the future and I feel good about it.

EDIT: For everyone saying that this doesn’t change anything and I should have broken up with him, and giving an ultimatum is going to backfire, etc. I didn’t give him an ultimatum. I never threatened to break up with him. I told him what I needed from him and we talked through a lot of questions and concerns(from both sides). It wasn’t a one-way conversation like you all seem to have assumed. Thank you to everyone for your continued support! I hope those of you who feel like relationship issues can never be resolved find happiness in your own lives ❤️

EDIT #2: For everyone saying that my ""timeline requirements"" sound controlling, you must not be women who want to have children. Sorry, but I'd like to have kids and unfortunately my clock is ticking; I think wanting to be married by the time I'm 30 is pretty reasonable. For everyone saying he's just telling me what I want to hear and will keep pushing me off, I understand your concern, but the conversation we had leads me to believe otherwise. I know that sounds fishy, but without relaying word for word what was said, I don't really know to explain it. Again, thank you all for your comments! You're really helping me think through everything from every angle.","This is a great update and I'm glad you two were able to talk. But coming from a person who has been married for 10 years and we still have communication hiccups, please work on communication before you get married.

And you cannot have a healthy relationship when neither of you are getting your needs met, or when you're not telling each other your concerns without pulling teeth.",4379,65,2021-02-07 19:17:04,let91g
relationships,UPDATE: When I 34f told boyfriend 36m I frequently feel judged/scrutinized by him he told me there are “millions of things” he doesn’t say. Do I need to change my perspective or are we incompatible?,"Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/go2t88/when_i_34f_told_boyfriend_36m_i_frequently_feel/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

First, thank you to everyone who responded to my original post. I remember exactly how confused and mentally exhausted I was at that point. Reading the responses and having my feelings validated by a bunch of internet strangers gave me the confidence to know I wasn’t being too sensitive (f that). It also got me out of a constant state of rumination about what was happening to me and why I felt so off and not myself and led me to act.

I told him I wanted space and that if we were both trying our best and our relationship felt like this we had a huge problem. I also told him that at some point he had stopped treating me like his girlfriend and started treating me like a defective human being and I was over it and wouldn’t continue to invest my time and energy into someone who treated me this way. 

Those first few days I spent alone were like an f-ing vacation. I couldn’t believe how amazing it felt to do simple, every day things without his constant interference and judgement. At the same time,  I did start to notice some of the things I was blaming him for being critical of me were really areas I was insecure and being critical of myself. I spent more time over the next few months investing in myself and and improving certain areas of my life.

Our relationship seemed to improve slightly over the next few months. The micromanaging and criticism really improved or I thought they improved. He might have just changed tactics. I think he started triangulating and upping the ante with the “innocent” insults. I think I had also gotten better at dealing with it and probably lowered the bar even more.

In the fall I had my first ever sciatica flare up. It was agonizing pain almost constantly. It lasted 8 weeks and I was trying everything - physical therapy, anti inflammatories, bio freeze, ice, not moving, powering through the pain. He was over it all after a few weeks and starting treating me like I was a lazy slob. I felt so scared and helpless about how much pain I was in and if It was ever going to get better or would I need surgery. The added stress of still trying to be a good partner was horrible. 

I’m not sure why this instance of his selfishness had more impact, but I felt something change inside of me in a profound way. Of course when I tried to talk to him about it, it went very poorly. The argument ended when he mocked me for crying and asked me why I couldn’t talk to him like a normal person .

I can’t remember when it started but I began to have physical responses during any kind of conflict with him. Sort of like fight or flight maybe? My hands start shaking, I start feeling overwhelmed and confused, my stomach is flipping, and eventually the tears come.

This comment from my original post rings true:

“It seriously sounds like a low key gateway to emotional abuse. I can't imagine his BS only starts and stops at just hacking away at OPs self worth and then gaslighting her about what's happening.

Those people get worse as the relationship goes on, not better.”

The BS certainly didn’t stop there. There were so many instances during our relationship where I felt he had lied to me. There were constant interactions where my instincts told me he was being inauthentic or he was hiding something or not giving me all the details. The addictions. The attention he gave women on social media. Always needing someone to blame. An almost embarrassing inability to take accountability.

I still feel pretty conflicted about what I did. I went through his phone. I started by looking for a couple specific times in the beginning of our relationship where my mind had flagged something as off or a lie but I had no idea why. Like when he insisted we go drop a bottle of champagne off to a friend of his as a congratulations for getting a new job. At the time I couldn’t place what felt off about this. I looked at texts from this specific date and now I know that we were really there to deliver cocaine. When I was able to confirm what my instincts told me were lies it was off to the races.

It was all pretty bad. He was on tinder for the first 6 months we were together, bumble for 9, and plenty of fish 11. All texts with other women deleted. Secret drug use. It’s hard to even remember everything but I tried to just confirm what I had felt to be lies. 

There is definitely a ton of anger and sadness but more than anything else I felt relief. Everything my instincts have been telling me since the beginning have been accurate and I have been fighting a losing battle against them. It felt freeing. 

Why have I continued this relationship in spite my instincts for 2.5 years and endless stress and chaos? My hair has been thinning since the 3 month mark in our relationship. I’ve had brain fog and memory problems despite being known for my iron trap memory. Sleeping issues. Weight fluctuations. My body has been physically rejecting this relationship. Somehow I either couldn’t admit that it was him or I was really that out of it. I’m starting to try and unwind it all in therapy.  I have had 3 sessions so far and am scheduled weekly for the foreseeable future. What I have learned so far is I was taught to not trust my feelings as a child by my Dad, who is very likely a narcissist. I’m really excited to work on my toxic patterns and behaviors in therapy and make the relationship I have with myself better and my priority.

We have been living in separate bedrooms for a couple weeks. The initial confrontation was horrible and I hurled some really rough insults and names at him. A few weeks ago I was thinking that I would have a final discussion about why we were breaking up and the logistics of him moving out etc. It still almost felt like I was going to have to convince him that this was a good enough reason to break up. 

After a deadline for work is over in the next couple days I’m going to tell him the relationship is over because I want it to be. And I do. I’m going to offer to pay for movers so I have an exact date he will be gone. I am nervous about his reaction and scared of what he might say to hurt me but I have never been more certain I’m making the right decision  so I know I’ll be able to handle whatever happens.

Again, thank you endlessly to anyone who took the time to comment on my original post or reached out. I felt seen and heard that day in a way that woke me up and nudged me to really start paying attention and stop turning everything inward. 

TL;DR I wasn’t being too sensitive; we are incompatible. He was not only making my life a living hell with all the criticism, gaslighting, and passive aggressive jabs, he was also a liar and a cheater. Coming to terms with all of it and working on myself in therapy.

Oh and one more thing - In my original post I played dumb about what he was insinuating when commenting about the shorts with the wet waistband. I was so paranoid at that time I wanted to see if other people came to the same conclusion that I had. When I reread my post that stuck out to me as sad.",I think you should have someone you trust present when you tell him it’s over.,4274,103,2021-01-31 19:14:08,l9jhzy
relationships,Update: should I move out?,"It’s been about a week since I talked to my dad and I’ve had a couple people message about an update, so I figured I’d give one.

For those who didn’t see my original post, I (16M) had to move in with my dad (47M) and his family after my mom died and things have been extremely strained—the worst incidences being my half-brother ripping pics of my mom up and my dad’s wife leaving me locked out of the house—so I was given the offer to move out by my dad’s friend and his husband (Both 30’s M).

I followed a couple peoples’ suggestion and texted my dad’s friend that I wanted to leave and they ended up suggesting we all go out to lunch. I think they could both tell how nervous I was around my dad and my dad’s friend J ended up being the one to bring up the idea of me moving out. My dad seemed completely blindsided by it and asked why I wanted to move out. J and his husband B reminded him about everything that’s been going on at home and I just kind of sat there.

My dad seemed really upset and it made me feel terrible because I already felt guilty about leaving, but then he just asked if I really wanted to go. I said yes and he just immediately agreed.

It kind of hit me that I wanted him to try and fight for me, to say sorry for everything that he’s been letting happen, and for my dad to try and keep me at home but he just let me go like it was nothing. It’s been hard after my mom died and my dad’s the only family I’ve got left, so it really didn’t make me feel any better about leaving, even though I don’t have to deal with my dad’s family anymore.

B took me back to their apartment while J went with my dad to get my stuff from the house, and they had set up their extra room for me already. He apologized that they hadn’t been able to do this sooner and that they hoped I would like living with them. J came back with all of my things and they kind of gave me time to decompress. I ended up sleeping for almost sixteen hours because I was so exhausted.

Over the last week, they’ve been really nice about making me feel at home and have talked to me about getting me into therapy to deal with losing my mom and everything that happened at my dad’s house. They’re also trying to figure out how to move me into a different school so I don’t have to deal with my half-sister and everyone that knew my half-brother. It’s the first time in months that I feel like I can actually breathe and I don’t feel like I’m constantly on guard. My dad hasn’t texted me much or reached out in the last week so I don’t know what’s going to happen with him but, for now, I’m safe I guess.

So that’s what’s happened so far. Thanks for everyone that gave me advice and wished me well. It’s been really hard lately and it made me feel less alone.

TL;DR: I managed to get out of my toxic living situation, moved in with my dad’s best friend and his husband, and things are going okay, even if I’m still having a hard time

Edit: Umm wow this unexpectedly blew up and I’m kind of stunned. My other posts never gained much traction so I never expected this update to get so much attention.

A quick update over the last 24 hours or so. B’s sister somehow saw this and send it to him, so he and J came in and asked. They never heard about the picture incident and apologized that they hadn’t asked to get me out sooner. They had no idea how bad it was and said I can stay as long as I want or need to. I realized then that I hadn’t really said thanks to them because it’s been so crazy so I told them how much I appreciated having the place to stay. It was a really emotional moment honestly and I’m glad it happened.

They did think it was funny that they’ve been called everything from my “roommates” to my “new landlords”, so that’s helped soften the mood a little.

Sorry I haven’t been able to respond to many comments, this feels really overwhelming but I just wanted everyone to know that the support means a lot. Thanks.","Wow man... Before reading this update, I went back and read the other posts and all I can say is I'm *really* glad your dad's friends offered you a place to stay. 

While I understand that your father's wife was blindsided by the son of her husband and his affair partner (your mom, obviously) suddenly living with her, there's absolutely no excuse for her and her kids treating you like shit.

relationships,"UPDATE: I (17m) cannot get my parents (45m, 44f) to listen to me regarding my sister's (6f) educational needs","Original post here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/n5hlsh/i\_17m\_cannot\_get\_my\_parents\_45m\_44f\_to\_listen\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/n5hlsh/i_17m_cannot_get_my_parents_45m_44f_to_listen_to/)

Hi everyone! About 98% of you were super wonderful on my last post and seemed genuinely invested so I thought I'd give you all an update. 

It's been just under a week now and after trying some of the different tactics and talking points you suggested, in addition to reaching out to the deaf/HOH community, my parents and I have come to a compromise, if only to shut me up. But I'm not the one that's important here, that would be Ana (6f).

So, come the new school year Ana will be going to the school my parents chose BUT we (including me!) will be keeping in close contact with her teachers, specialists, etc, her progress and talking to Ana herself about how she feels. If it seems like it isn't a great fit, we will be transferring her to the deaf school. It's a little out of the area, but I think we can make it work. 

I did open up to my parents a bit - as much as they could handle - and told them that I feel like I've been, not robbed but had a stunted childhood and that my academic abilities forced me to grow up quickly. That, coupled with their emotional distance and lack of physical presence with Ana, made me angry and frustrated that my opinions on her future weren't being taken into account.

I wish I could say that was what did it, but honestly my points about the school not teaching Ana independence and other arguments brought up on the original post probably eased them over to my side a bit (I kept my temper even this time).

I mentioned in my edit on the last post that I'd gotten in contact with a Deaf Advocacy group and they've provided some wonderful resources so hopefully sometime soon Ana will FINALLY be able to meet kids and adults like her! (She's SUPER excited by this. She's the least reserved and most outgoing sibling out of us three so I've no doubt she'll make friends quickly.)

I've also made the decision to start seeing a therapist to maybe work on some of the issues that I've been reflecting on and to get some emotional support where my mom and dad drop the ball. I don't see them changing or even admitting they need to change anytime soon. But that doesn't mean I have to stay complacent. 

That's...more or less the main chunk of what I wanted to say. I notice the rules say we aren't allowed to upload images so I'll just describe the drawing Ana just gave me to pin up on my office wall (she's a brilliant little artist, I'm not even biased).

*An ocean surface. A large boat approaches from the left hand side, full of garbage. A great blue whale stands, mid-breech, opposing, brandishing a gun in one flipper. A speech bubble from the whale reads* ***'NO!'*** *while the ambiguously-gendered humans on the Garbage Boat scream in terror, presumably ready to flee.* 

(Her kindergarten assignment was to come up with a way we can protect our oceans from pollution and personally, I think she's hit the nail on the head.)

Thank you so much to everyone for your thoughts and feedback!

**TL;DR: my parents and I came to a compromise on my deaf sister's elementary school, I am working through my issues, Ana is getting to know her community and she drew an awesome picture today.**","You fought for her. That's amazing. I know we're strangers, but I was a 17 year old once, and I know how hard it can be to stand up to the adults in your life at that age, so I'm really proud of you. And I'm glad your sister has you in her life. You did a good thing. 

Tell her that her drawing is awesome!",4093,65,2021-05-10 18:26:01,n9c90l
relationships,UPDATE: I don’t know what to expect for my [23F] date with my best friend [23M] and I don’t feel ready for it,"[Link to original post:](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/nk1p9w/i_dont_know_what_to_expect_for_my_23f_date_with/)

My head is still spinning from our date last night. I was so nervous that I felt sick and I literally almost canceled last minute, but I'm so happy that I went through with it! I told him beforehand that I had anxiety about not knowing where he was taking me and I didn't know what to wear. He still wouldn't give away the surprise but he did tell me to dress comfortably, so I just wore one of my nice casual dresses. He made us an outdoor drive-in movie theatre (don't ask me how he did it because I'm hopeless with technology) where we watched my favorite movie and he brought popcorn and my favorite chocolate! Afterwards he took me to this new bookstore cafe in our town which had just opened and I had been dying to go to. I was so happy when he finally kissed me even though I had been previously dreading that he would. We actually kissed quite a bit. I found that my heart was beating not from nerves this time, but from genuine excitement. Now I look forward to intimacy with him and I feel like it'll just make us even closer. It's still unbelievable to me that this is happening, but it doesn't scare me anymore.

I never thought Connor would ever make me feel like this. In my head it just wasn't a possibility since we were such good friends. I couldn't be happier that I decided to give him a chance instead of just immediately shutting it down in fear of ruining the friendship. In reality, our friendship was never in any danger. Yes, there are real differences between dating and just being best friends but there are WAY more similarities than I was expecting. The conversation still flowed the same way it did when we were only friends and we still have plenty of fun and laughs. I'm overjoyed that our friendship dynamic hasn't changed because I was mainly worried that things would be awkward now and I wouldn't know how to behave around him. Now it feels like we're friends who just happen to be dating and IMO that's exactly how things should be. Seeing how happy he is just feels like the cherry on top.

TL;DR: I was terrified to date my best friend. I ended up being pleasantly surprised and I had fun on the date. Thank you so much to everyone who calmed me down and told me to be honest with him about my anxiety beforehand because your advice really helped!",I am pretty sure I just barfed sprinkles,4054,78,2021-05-27 21:04:34,nmhloz
relationships,My (F47) husband (M48) finally wants to try counseling now that our youngest will be leaving for college and I am planning to leave. Should I agree to counseling?,"This is a throw away for anonymity. For 25 years I have been in a marriage that has always been rocky. 12 plus years ago I was going to leave, told my family etc. Only to believe him when he said he would try. Of course things were better for a while...at some point I decided to stick it out until my kids were grown because I was afraid that having them in a visitation arrangement would be mentally damaging to them. That's his big issue, he is verbally abusive and controlling. I'm an independent, successful person and I am also  financially independent. I  have been able to keep him ""in check"" so to speak in regard to the kids most of the time because I simply won't tolerate his attempts to control them. That's not to say he has not habitually made our oldest feel less than or like he is a disappointment. Both of our kids are well adjusted, bright, motivated and loving. But, if they don't measure up in some way, his reaction is unbelievably harsh. He says hurtful things to the kids and they have both, at times, broken down crying about his treatment of them. All he cares about is ""his money"" and doesn't even want to help our kids with college. There's more, I could go on but, the question is, do I try counseling? My concern is that it's just a ploy to pull me back in. I begged him for years to go and he refused.

Tl;dr My (F47) husband (M48) finally wants to try counseling now that our youngest will be leaving for college and I am planning to leave.",Isn’t it a bit insulting to you that for 25 years he’s acted the way he has and only now he “wants to try” counseling? Like why weren’t you worth that before?  You know why? He’s manipulating you into not leaving.,3850,186,2021-01-16 20:20:26,kyqjar
relationships,How do I (28f) tell my husband (30m) that I am not a fan of his greasy ponytail without sounding like a jerk?,"When we were dating and for most of our marriage (4 years) he has had short hair. It wasn’t until covid that he started growing it out. 

Now, I actually like his long hair. I love it when he wears it down and it’s clean. The problem is, he never wears it down and despite me trying to show him different things like conditioners and product and how to brush it, he’s never had long hair so he’s not used to the effort it takes to maintain. He doesn’t seem interested in learning, either. He washes it with soap and sometimes goes days without washing it at all, so he transforms from Jason Momoa into Ed from 90 day fiancé really quickly. It’s always tied back into a greasy, stringy ponytail, and he wears it in a high pony which I hate because it makes him look like a cheerleader. He also uses my bright pink scrunchies and bows when we are around the house because it’s convenient, and also because he thinks it’s funny, but I don’t find it attractive at all. I also don’t want to use my brush and my hair ties anymore after he does just because his hair is so nasty. Imagine if Jojo siwa didn’t wash her hair for five days. That’s what I’m married to. 

How do I go about this? I don’t really want to hurt his feelings, but the little hints I’ve been dropping like trying to show him how to take care of his hair have not been working. I’m starting to resent his total lack of effort into his appearance. It’s  one thing to not comb your hair one day or just stay in your pajamas, but his hair is just straight up gross and I cannot take it anymore. 

Tl;dr: husband grew out his hair when covid happened, has no interest in cutting it now that things are opening up, but refuses to take cake of his hair and I think it’s gross. How do you confront a partner about their hygiene and appearance when they let themselves go?

Edit: thanks everyone for your suggestions. I don’t have time to answer everyone individually tonight, but the consensus seems to be that the time for sparing feelings has passed and a blunt conversation is the best way to go. I’m going to reread all your responses and put together what I want to say and give it a go. If it doesn’t go well, then I’ll take the advice of the one redditor who suggested I cut it off while he was sleeping.

Edit #2: wow, I didn’t expect this to blow up like it did. calm down folks, I’m not going to actually cut his hair while he’s sleeping, that was a joke. I might spray it with dry shampoo though.","I guess you could just randomly dump some shampoo on his head, which would force him to then go and rinse it out. 

Or, you know, you could just be direct. ""Babe, I love you, but your hair is nasty and it's not attractive when you don't wash it for a week and I'm going to have to burn all my hair ties.""",3816,196,2021-06-18 23:14:36,o32tvx
relationships,Husband (32) gaming for 6+ hours a night,"We've been married for 3 years and been together for 7. He is an avid gamer however its getting ridiculous now. I absolutely understand his need to game, it's his downtime and I would never ask him to stop altogether. However we haven't gone to bed together in over 2 years, he stays up till 3/4am every night gaming. I can't get any sleep, it's a small house so all I can hear is the clicking of the mechanical keyboard and him talking to the others online. He'll sleep till 12/1pm on the weekends, he games for most of the day and night, thinks spending an hour or 2 with me after I make dinner is 'quality time' (it really isn't). I've tried talking to him about this but it always escalates into a fight and he says that he'll be living a miserable life if he has to limit his gaming time.  I'm stuck doing all of the household chores while working full time and running my own business (a bakery). I love alone time as much as the next person but I feel so lonely as we can't do anything together because his world revolves around it. I have tried every approach and he won't budge. He turns it around on me saying that I'm being controlling, needy and that I'm changing him which I'm absolutely not, I have never asked him to stop and would never. He does work so I understand the need to escape and have time alone. Any advice is much appreciated.

TL;DR Husbad games all night, refuses to see it may be a problem in our marriage","I read a similar story on here a few years ago and the girlfriend/wife had good success with asking her husband to just track his hours, everything he did. Then rank his priorities in life and compare how he spent his time to his priorities. He would *tell her* she was his priority but she was able to demonstrate that is not where he was prioritizing his time.

IDK. My husband went through a phase where gaming was a problem, but it was that, and directly related to his mental health. 

Aside from making it extremely clear that he is prioritizing a digital life over his irl wife and that you are being negatively affected by his gaming and are not going to stick around for that forever or subject kids/dogs whatever to it. And that playing an hour or two at night and a couple hours on the weekend are fine but what he's doing is unhealthy for everyone including himself, there's not much you can do. It really is similar to dealing with an addict. You have to decide what **your** boundaries are and stick to them.

ETA: also. You are not obligated to try to fix him or try to solve this problem. This is a problem of his creation. If he does nothing and you leave you should not feel guilty. **You deserve to be treated well in a relationship, and not expected to sit on a shelf until your partner is ready to play with you. You are a whole person with needs and wants and it is a good thing to know that and fight for it**",3756,186,2021-01-10 13:15:08,kue9rm
relationships,"My (41F) husband (43M) is refusing (out of pride) to accept his parents financial help even though both of us are unemployed and in debt. I am honestly not sure what to do, we have a 6 year old kid with medical issues and we cant afford to keep up like this.","My husbands parents have a ton of money. I don't know the exact amount but I would guess just based on their buying and selling of property its somewhere in the 8-15 million range. My husband seemingly has always resented that he came from a rich background, he is a VERY do-it-yourself kind of guy and dislikes handouts. Even before the pandemic, his parents always offered to help us out with stuff and he always refused. We would argue about it but it was never that big of a deal because we were both financially stable. To him, this is a super sensitive topic, one which he wont even entertain. He always tells me to just act as if his parents have nothing. 

&#x200B;

Last year, my son developed some medical issues. I'm not gonna go over them, its not deadly, but he does need expensive treatment and eventually likely surgery. I took off from work to watch him, which put a major dent in our finances. Fast forward to 4 months ago, and my husband lost his job. The past 4 months have seen us arguing non stop about finances. His parents have PLEADED with him non-stop to help us out, and he refuses. He would rather everybody suffer, and he is like, 110% deadset on fixing this situation himself. He is COMPLETELY confident that he will fix all of these issues on his own, that he will find a job or start a business that will save us. Meanwhile, medical bills have piled on, our mortgage payments are late, and we have effectively burnt through our savings. We quite simply cannot keep going like this. 

&#x200B;

I mostly manage our finances. I think that, oddly enough, him growing up in a rich home and also getting a good job right out of college means that he doesn't entirely comprehend the kind of situation we are barreling towards, so even while he likes to sort of reject the benefits of having rich parents, in a way it also means he is blind to what it means to not be rich. Even while we are headed into debt, we haven't changed our lifestyles that much (we were frugal before this). The only difference has been debt piling up. 

&#x200B;

I am not looking for financial advice. I am looking for a way to get my husband to accept his parents money. We have been looking everywhere for a job for him, and as of right now with unemployment through the roof and his industry especially having been destroyed, we have no prospects in the near future. There isn't much of a solution except his parents helping us out. How in gods name do I get him to accept the money? For me? For his KID who has medical issues which cost a fortune? 

&#x200B;

TL;DR - - How do I get my husband to accept the money his parents are offering us? We are in debt and both unemployed and our kid has health issues, and he is refusing to take their offer.","If he doesn't want to accept a gift, he could accept a loan; it's better to be indebted to relatives than to some bank, so maybe you could convince him to accept the money as a loan, write up paperwork between him and his parents to indicate this is a loan, and he'll pay it back when he gets a job etc.",3725,205,2021-01-18 04:05:28,kzmpla
relationships,UPDATE: My boyfriend gets panic attacks when I go out with my friends,"UPDATE: It has been over a year since I (20f) made this post, and I only just realized that I 1.) never officially thanked you all for the responses, feedback, and support and 2.) never made an update on my situation.

SO- Today is actually the one year anniversary of our breakup. Ending things was simultaneously the most challenging, yet best decision I could have made. We had a slow breakup that dragged on for a while; it was heartbreaking and incredibly painful but I’ve grown so much more than I ever could have imagined since then. Confident to say that I’m happier than I ever have been :) 

As for my ex(19m)- we’re still friends (respectively). We don’t hang out very often anymore, but we’re in the same friend group and so bump into each other here and there. We’ve also talked a few times since, just kind of checking in and seeing how the other is doing. I am very very happy to also report that he’s been seeing a therapist and is getting help for his mental health and trauma. 


My own mental health is also at an all time high —— through the breakup months and time after, I struggled really bad mentally, and considered seeing a therapist. At one point I could found relief in convincing myself that I had severe OCD. I joined r/ROCD (relationship OCD) after spiraling and self-diagnosing but have since unsubbed after many conversations and actual mental health help. Thanking every star that I had/have such a strong support system in my life (hi, parents, siblings, best friend).**

**This little tid bit is sort of irrelevant to the update, but I wanted to include it in case anyone else is struggling or finding themself in a similar situation or is just hurting and looking for support. My DMs are always open.


TL;DR It’s my one year breakup anniversary but I’m doing better than ever and the ex-boyfriend is also doing good and is now in therapy

relationships,UPDATE** My(31f) husband(32M) doesn't enjoy sex with me,"https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/p3j4zo/my31f_husband32m_doesnt_enjoy_sex_with_me/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

I am on mobile so sorry if link doesn't work. I thought I should share what happened after the post to u guys since I got so many helping replies.

So first of all one thing I realised was that I never thought that he might not like what I like in bed. I believed he was also enjoying as much and never properly talked to him about it.

And then me and my husband had a long conversation about the issue. At first he was like there is no issues at all. So I asked him what part of our intimacy did he like the most. He told me he liked undressing me and seeing me naked the most and then after sex cuddling as second. So basically the specific PiV part was not liked. I asked him if he has any specific thing he wanted to introduce. He didn't have anything perticular in mind so I asked him to look it up with me. We read some online stuff about different kinks. He showed interest towards blindfolds and handcuffs. So we bought it.

The next night we decided to try it out. He handcuffed and blindfolded me. Halfway through, he suddenly opens my blindfolds and tells me that it was even worse than before. So I thought it was a failure.

Yesterday night, I was thinking about some other stuff we can do when he came to me with the handcuffs. But this time... He wanted me to use it on him instead. At first I was like wtf?? But I decided why not it won't hurt to try. So I handcuffed him, took the lead. And for me... I enjoyed the fuck out of it. His reactions were amazing to watch. I did fumble a few times but we reached the end. He also told me this was hugely better. So.... Yeah looks like he was a submissive type. I myself am not a pure dom but I liked to take to lead too. 

And I also asked him that he told me at first that he liked seeing me naked so how is he also liking being blindfolded? He said that he did like to see me but the fact that he wasn't able to turned him on. Can anyone explain this to me? 

Otherwise reading ur replies was a big big help. So thank u to all of u. I would also be happy to say he is not asexual or has someone else. 

Tldr: husband turned out of be a sub.","About the him liking not being able to see you. It's more of the same: submission. 

It isn't the fact that he isn't able to see you what gets him off. It's the fact he wants to see you but can't or isn't ""allowed"" to. This fact basically underlines that he isn't in charge or that it isn't about ""what he wants"", if that makes sense.",3661,68,2021-08-18 08:28:08,p6n201

Never thought I would be updating this. I took the advice and decided to take it slow and just not spill my feelings but the idea of spending time with her without telling her my feelings felt terrible. I was pretty miserable for two days and she ended up asking me why I looked awfully sad and if she could do anything to fix my mood. 

I spilled all my feelings for her, it was probably the most unromantic confession ever. She was really surprised that I was into her. We spend the whole night talking. She told me she had been crushing on me for ever since we moved in. She said she never though someone as sweet as me could fall for a 'callous inconsiderate B' like her. 

I have never heard Bullshit like that before, she is a bit cold and she doesn't smile a lot but that doesn't make her callous or inconsiderate. She has done a million things for me since we have moved in. I think we both realize that we could have been together way earlier if it wasn't for our fucked up self perception issues. We mostly joked about going to therapy and shit we went through growing up. She is fucked up too but in a way different way than I am. lol. On a serious note, we are both planning on going to therapy. We could have been together for so many months! but we both thought the other would never both with the other. wtf.  My parents actively discouraged me from doing it and her parents said she needed therapy to be kinder. So haha. This is pretty scary but we both are gonna try to make this work.

TLDR : Talked to her, she had feelings for me, we are dating now and searching for therapist.","I love this kind of story! Even more, I love how mature y’all are being about it now! Instead of saying “we balance each other out and make each other better” you’re actively taking it upon yourselves to become better versions of yourself! 

So happy for y’all and I hope you grow together for years to come 🥰",3549,49,2021-09-06 15:09:25,pj17y3
relationships,How do I start a relationship with my nieces and nephew when their father was responsible for my brother's passing.,"One of my employees mentioned that this may be a good place to get some advice for my current dilemma. I (46M) am one of 4 kids. My older brother P (48M I think) who I no longer have any contact with, my younger brother J who is no longer with us, and my youngest sister K (44F). Recently P’s children (2 girls and 1 boy, all in their late teens and early 20s) reached out to me and expressed a desire to have a relationship. I have zero contact with their father and swore that I would beat him black and blue if I ever saw him again.

A little back ground:

My oldest brother P was always the golden child. No matter what he did, my parents always had an excuse for why it was not his fault. Bad grade? Teacher had it out for him. Cheating on every single one of his relationships? “Good thing you did it to her before she did it to you” (That one was my personal favorite). He also used to torment J and I constantly when we were smaller than him, until in high school, when I hit a growth spurt and sprung up to about 6’4 and 230lbs worth of muscle. After that I became the typical jock type. Played football, partied, bunch of friends, etc. Well, my younger brother, J, didn’t get as lucky and stayed pretty small and scrawny throughout high school and college only getting up to about 5’8 and didn’t have a super active social life. Despite the difference in our schooling experience I was always very protective of J, especially since we were always having to put up with P’s bullshit. Which stopped once he realized I could pound him into the ground and not break a sweat, as he was also a lot smaller than me at only 5’10. Not much to say about K. She was a great younger sister and P didn’t dare mess with her or he would incur the wrath of our mother.

So, in the late 90s, J met his first real girlfriend, A and was over the moon about her. He spent every spare moment with her, and when he wasn’t with her, he would do nothing but gush about her. I had never seen him so happy. Well, one day, he comes to us, all smiles, and announces that A is pregnant and they are expecting. The mood quickly turned however when a week later it came out that A had been cheating on J for the duration of their relationship with our older brother P. This broke my brother, and of course P, being the golden shit that he is, didn’t even get a disappointed glance from our parents. To this day I have never seen someone look so broken as J had looked the last time I saw him. I believe his heart ache was only compounded by the fact that my parents basically told him to get over it and be happy for our brother. Well about a week after this revelation came to light, J took his own life. I had never been so sad and angry at the same time in my entire life. Sad that I would never see my brother again, and the pure rage of knowing that this was my brother and parents’ fault.

During the funeral, P walked in with A and I saw red. Thankfully I had other family there to stop me from doing anything stupid, but I told P that if I ever saw him again, I would kill him. Shortly after that, I cut contact with 90% of my family, with the exception of K and a cousin I had always been close with, because everyone except them wanted to make excuses for my parents and P.

Fast forward to present, I never had any kids and truth be told, I never wanted any. I much prefer the role of the fun uncle. K met a great guy and had 2 daughters, who I absolutely adore. P had two more kids with A before cheating on her (shocker…) and splitting and I’ve never met any of them. My parents have tried to make contact a handful of times but I always told them to kick rocks. So last week, I’m chatting with K’s daughters (19 and 17) and they mention that their cousins have wanted to meet me for a long time and were hoping I would be willing to meet them as well. I don’t believe they know everything that transpired between their dad and I, but I would be lying if I said I never had any desire to meet them.

So everyone, I’m hoping to crowd source any ideas/suggestions on how I begin/maintain a relationship with P’s kids while also keeping him and A out of my life. Any suggestions are welcome.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: 20+ years ago my older brother caused my younger brother's suicide. Now his kids want to meet me and have a relationship but i don't know how to have a relationship without my brother getting involved.

&#x200B;

EDIT: One commenter just brought up a good point that kind of changes my question. The reason i wanted to meet with them soon is because they are all back in town at once from college due to covid, but someone gave me the idea that maybe meeting them one at a time once they return to their college campuses/old living arrangements is the better option. Thoughts?

&#x200B;

EDIT 2: I've had multiple people ask me why K still talks with the people i cut contact with so i'll just copy/paste one of my replies here.

Even though my sister was just as crushed about J's death as i was and was angry for a long time. She and her then boyfriend (future husband) hit a financial rough patch after graduating college and were forced to move in with our parents. Due to unrelated drama at the time, they couldn't stay with me. So my sister stayed with them for several years and over that time their relationship improved and even though i wasn't thrilled at the time, I understood. She still doesn't really have a relationship with P but is cordial if they meet. I don't blame her, because our parents did a lot for her and daughters love their cousins, so i didn't want put her in that kind of position of choosing.",Did you already ask K's daughters if their cousins know the truth? Since it is very important for you then maybe K's daughters could help you figure it out as they seem to be in a good relationship with them,3514,101,2021-07-16 17:41:17,ollvr8
relationships,UPDATE: My (20F) friend (20F) tried to hook up with my boyfriend (22M) a few weeks ago and he didn't tell me about it,"[https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/mh0zpp/my\_20f\_friend\_20f\_tried\_to\_hook\_up\_with\_my/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/mh0zpp/my_20f_friend_20f_tried_to_hook_up_with_my/)

&#x200B;

So, I told my boyfriend that I understand why he did it and that I get that he wanted to avoid hurting me but that he doesn't get to make that choice for me. He said he understands that he should have told me, but that he had kind of hoped that she was just having a weird moment and that it wouldn't happen again and we'd avoid the entire thing completely.  I told him that from now on I want him to be upfront with me about this kind of thing. I also told him that if he was worried about if I'm going to believe him over my ""friend"" or not he shouldn't be. Because I honestly suspected that she was into him anyway, I would have definitely believed him. 

Anyway, I feel like he totally understood where I'm coming from. If anything this whole thing kinda made us be in on the same page about this type of stuff. 

I want to thank everyone for the advice because I was honestly getting paranoid because I've been cheated on before and my friends are kinda cynical so they expected the worst which me made me do the same. Ironically because of this whole thing and the talk we had after, I feel like I can trust him more. For now I'm gonna try to stop assuming the worst. 

Thanks to everyone who chipped in. 

TLDR: My boyfriend and I had a talk about what happened. He explained to me his point of view and I explained to him mine. He understood why I was upset and I feel like we really got on the same page. So, everything worked out for the best.","And that, kids, is why we use communication with our S/O's.",3467,43,2021-04-02 12:15:15,mij4ms
relationships,UPDATE: My (19F) Biological father’s (45M) wife (40F) wants me to just “leave them alone”,"Hello! Sorry this update has taken a while to come out, but I promise there is a good reason for it!

1. My girlfriend drove down to visit me for a week and I was preoccupied spending time with her

2. I was really hoping that the news I have to share with you would change

So long story short, I took the advice I was given and muted Heather’s messages to me. The stuff she was saying to me has really gotten to me and at this point I’m not quite sure if I’m the bad guy. I called Harold and talked to him about the situation, and told him that I don’t think it is in my best interests to be talking to his wife. 

This is where things took a bit of a sad turn. Harold agreed with his wife and said it would be best if I just left them alone for a while. I was stunned for a few moments, because this is the opposite of what he had told me less than 24 hours earlier. That said, even if he had said something else beforehand, I know that I have to respect his decision. I told him that I would stop all contact, and when he is ready to talk again it will be on him to message me. That’s where the call ended, and we haven’t spoken since.

It sucks. I’m kinda hurt. I know I have no right to be hurt about it, but I still am. I’ve come to the decision that it’s not my job to make them like me. This was probably not going to end any other way. It’s painful, but it’s the world we live in.

I’m sorry I don’t have a happier ending to share, but I’d still like to thank you guys for the amount of support and loving messages I received on my first post. I don’t think I could have endured this without you guys, and the validation you provided me. Thank you for taking the time out of your day to send such kind messages and helpful advice. I appreciate each and every one of you, and am sending virtual hugs!

TLDR: Harold’s wife got to him, and there is no more contact. She won, and I am leaving them alone.

(ALSO if I link the old post wrong, please let me know so I can fix it!)

EDIT: Yooo!! I got on one of the Reddit YouTube videos! Apparently everyone on YouTube either thinks the story is fake, or that Heather’s sons don’t belong to Harold. ALSO, I still haven’t heard anything from Harold. I’m starting to think that something is either very wrong, or they genuinely don’t want me around. I’ve stuck to my guns though, and I’m not contacting them.

Edit 2, in October: Two things have happened! 

1. I needed to reach out to him because my cat got sick again and he works in pet insurance and care, and I asked him for advice on what insurance carrier to use. It was cordial and completely professional. No emotions and nothing other than business. It hurt to see him act so cold, but thus is life. 

2. His wife, who my Dad (Markus) now refers to exclusively as “Heather”, updated her Facebook so that it says “Stay in your lane, Bitch”, directly under her name when you click on her profile. I feel grossed out that she’s acting like I’m some jealous lover who wants to “steal her man”. I’m his kid, not his affair partner. 

Also I’m going down to see my girlfriend this December!! She’s been the biggest help and support throughout this disaster. If I ever get a more significant update, I’ll ask the mods to let me post a part 3! I doubt I’ll get one though. I think this is where this saga ends. I have an adopted dad who loves me, and a biological mother who loves me. I think I can be content with that. :)","Lol, dont think ""she won"". Neither of them did, and you shouldn't feel bad for that. If anything, you should pity them.",3454,124,2021-08-10 13:43:44,p1pg2b
relationships,[Update] My [27/F] GF [30/F] hasn't had a job in 4 years and it's wearing me down,"[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/jjb9kf/my_27f_gf_30f_hasnt_had_a_job_in_4_years_and_its/)

# TLDR: Broke up. She was taking advantage in the last two years.

I posted about a 4 year relationship causing me mental, emotional, and physical health problems due to said partner failing to find a job or contribute to the finances in any meaningful way. I made the post at the height of the COVID in my area, trying to keep the relationship alive. At the time, we had moved to a new state and a smaller town to live more cheaply, and to help address my physical needs that couldn't be met in the city with everything and everyone locked down. 

Things were good for a few months. However, the job question came back again. I was working full time, and had taken on new responsibilities for keeping myself in shape, working hard to lose the weight. That's when I noticed she was just kind of... existing. She wasn't excited about anything in the area, and wasn't doing much to find jobs. I had a talk with her in October, and we agreed that perhaps my request that she find a salaried 9-6 job could be relaxed, and part time would be sufficient to help out. After all, I only needed two things from her: space from time to time, and her to help out in any way she could with the finances. 

The first of two final straws occurred that winter: I was working to build a new business from scratch, and I had to leave my job in order to do it, which meant around ~4 months of negative income. It was going to be tight, but she agreed to help support by finding an easy job. This support never came. She couldn't do it, or didn't want to. I began to notice it felt more like the latter. As a result, we barely made rent in February, thanks to my taking on contract work on the side (effectively working two jobs). 

We had a huge fight in February over this. I wasn't willing to be that close to being homeless just because she didn't want to work a job that was beneath her qualifications. I made it explicit that this was a deal breaker for me, and that I would not move an inch in the relationship until she started contributing in the way we discussed. She agreed. 

Another 5 months went by with no job. At this point, frustrated with her lack of success, she asks me to move with her to her hometown and move in with her parents while she looks for a job where she had a network. I flat out refused and we went on break. I moved to a new state and hoped that maybe some space would allow me to think clearly about the relationship.

By September this year, I realized I felt completely happy to be on my own, and stress free. We broke it off completely. To my knowledge, she still doesn't have a job as of this post. 

I feel used, emotional, physically, and financially abused, and hurt by how casually someone could run me into the ground like this. But I also feel hopeful about myself, and I'm seeing a therapist who's helping me unpack it all. Further, my business was worth it, and it's taken off and given me enough time and space to deal with all of this while maintaining a healthy lifestyle. 

Overall, the biggest downer is I feel like i've just wasted 5 years of my life with someone who I'm fairly sure was a subtle abuser the whole time. It hurts to say it, but the way I always felt like the bad guy, or the way she would guilt trip me and keep me from my friends... bad news. I'll never let anyone do this to me again.","You didn't waste 5 years, you saved yourself 50.

This experience will help you if you decide to have another relationship. You will know how to identify positive traits and will not give too many chances when dealing with negative traits. You're much more likely to have a happy future.

relationships,UPDATE: LDR boyfriend (M23) cheated on me (F20) after 3 years together with another girl (F<20) - do I tell the other girl?,"Update to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ns0k6y/ldr_boyfriend_m23_cheated_on_me_f20_after_3_years/) post. **TL;DR from that post is:** Boyfriend of 3 years cheating with someone else, they've been together for 9 months. I broke up with him. She doesn't know I exist. She sounds severely depressed, suicidal and self-harms plus issues with drugs and alcohol. He asked me not to tell her as she would ""kill herself"". Unsure if I should - moral conundrum. Help.

&#x200B;

I told her. Sent her a long message from my own instagram account (no burners or anything). Lots of empathy and kindness. Told her I was on her side. She asked for proof, sent that through. 

Ex texted me 5 mins later with ""You did it hey?"" (I'd blocked him on all social medias except for phone number). Then he weirdly thanked me; said it was better for his head and mental health now. I did him a favour. Baffled me a little. Sent him a couple harsh text messages explaining it wasn't for him, but for her. She deserved the truth. He apologised again, lol, and then I sent him a final message and blocked.

Girl seemed devestated, not angry at me thankfully as I was scared of her spinning it against me which I don't think I could've handled in my... delicate state lol. Told her I was there for her. Had a little chat, but haven't talked to her since (12hrs ago). Not expecting to continue talking. Dunno if she properly broke up with him, or taking a break since they still follow eachother but she changed her profile pic so it's no longer matching and relationship date from her bio is gone. None of my business what happens next, I just hope she's okay and takes the next steps which are healthy for her. No idea if she's suicidal/self-harming - I had that in the long message sent to her that 'he told me you were vulnerable and suffering from depression so I debated sending this msg but I think you deserve the truth'. Inevitably, I think it's better for her to know rather than confide in a liar who is abusing her vulnerability. 

Thank you to everyone who replied on the previous post, definitely helped to see other strangers agreeing with sending a message and informing her. If anyone ends up in a similar situ, I hope you never do, but send the message to the ***unknowing*** affair partner. It'll relieve your conscience I think, even though you're not in the wrong. That sounds weird, but trust me I know **I** was the one cheated on and that she was the 'other woman' but it still felt good to tell her what the real truth was, rather than him spinning it against me or never telling her. It's kinda like a final kaboom in my exes face, making sure he can't just go crawling to his other girlfriend now that I broke up with him, and she knew the full truth and can decide what to do next (break up or stay together). 

I feel relieved. I have finally stopped feeling nauseated and throwing up. Had my first good nights sleep since I found out. Nothing but bad feelings for the ex. I dunno if it's hate, that's a strong word. I resent what he put me through, and the waste of time, and the lies for such a long time. He's made me unsure of myself and everything he told me, but I have enough self-respect to break-up with him. Miss what I thought we had I think? I dunno. It was all lies I guess. I want him to figure himself out, mature and eventually settle down (not with me). Holding all my resentment against the cheating ex, not affair partner. 

The hurt is setting in now. Last couple days it was anger. Now it's just pain lol. Now, can anyone offer post-discovering-your-long-term-partners-been-cheating-on-you-for-almost-a-year advice? I'm not used to not being busy and am having too many thoughts, I just finished final exams so have been studying for months and been busy and now its... nothing. Glad I found out after exams, but not sure what to do now. Advice appreciated.

**TL;DR:** Told the unknowing affair partner via Instagram DMs on my personal account. Long, empathetic message telling her I'm on her side + proof when she asked for it. Ex texted me ""you did it hey?"" and then thanked me. Blocked his number. She seems sad, unsure if 100% broken up but pfps and date in bio changed. I don't care, not my business. Hope for the best for her. Now I need advice on how to heal, if anyone has any. Thanks.","When he comes crawling back (and believe me babe, he will) you shoot me a message and I’ll venmo you money for a drink on me. So proud of you girl.",3285,34,2021-06-06 09:36:17,nti1h4
relationships,My (57M) daughter (32F) is refusing to speak to me because I went on a trip while she’s struggling financially.,"I have four daughters – two biological (“Sarah” 32F & “Suzie” 30F) and two stepdaughters (“Amy” 31F & “Annie” 28F). My oldest daughter and youngest stepdaughter don’t really like each other anymore. They’re barely civil, and they completely ignore each other unless they’re forced to interact.

Sarah is struggling financially. It’s partly due to the pandemic but mostly due to her husband and his lack of work ethic or financial sense. He spends money faster than they earn it and we’ve bailed them out multiple times already. The pandemic has hit me hard financially so I’m no longer in a position to help them. 

On the other hand, Annie is married to a wealthy man and has generously been helping everyone (excluding Sarah) financially for the past year.

Annie invited my wife and me to join her family at her in-law’s holiday home. She offered to cover all of our expenses and my wife missed her a lot, so we agreed to go. We didn’t really think about how it would make Sarah feel.

Sarah found out about the trip and is now furious at me. She thinks I’m lying about not having money to help her and doesn’t believe Annie would pay for it. She is refusing to speak to me and has told Suzie she feels like I replaced them with my stepdaughters. 

I would really like to fix this, but she continues to ignore any attempt by me to get into contact with her.

TL;DR – I went on a trip to visit my stepdaughter, she covered all of our expenses but my oldest daughter, who is struggling financially,  doesn’t believe me and is now refusing to speak to me.","A 32 year old married woman has her priorities all wrong. Even if you did pay for that trip...she’s too old to feel so entitled to daddy’s money. She needs home truths about being a grown up, solving your own problems and being responsible for yourself more than anything else. Yes it’s nice to help where possible, but her and her husband can’t be expecting you to not live your life just because they’re struggling",3094,168,2021-05-22 21:55:25,nit3wr
relationships,My (17F) sister (15F) smells really bad and every time I try to tell her she takes it as teasing,"
Sorry for any errors, I’m writing this on mobile.
     So my sister has never been one for good hygiene. She didn’t take brushing her teeth seriously until she got two cavities and to this day refuses to brush her tongue so her breath smells bad (I sometimes get on to her about it but she’ll lie and say she did). She’s never really taken care of herself because my mom has always babied her.
      
Anyway, her bad habits have extended to her room. One of our dogs like to stay in her room, and because of that it will poop and pee on the pee pads we had to start placing. One of her only chores was to pick up the waste and keep her room clean, but she doesn’t. She will literally leave the poop there for days and rarely changes the pee pads, and it’s to the point where I have to go in daily now to do it. Not only that but she never cleans her mattress (we tried to once together and brown stuff kept coming off the mattress but it’s still not clean) and rarely washes her sheets. Because of all this and more, she smells terrible and I can’t stand the smell of her room (our rooms are right next to each other too so when my door is opened I can smell it). 
      
I have a really sensitive nose and some sensory issues so the stench always sends me into a sensory overload episode and I can’t really stand to be around her anymore. I try to tell her that she needs to wash her sheets and keep her room clean, but she just does the whole “no you” routine because she thinks I’m teasing her. 
      
I don’t know what to do. I’m going to college in a few months so I won’t be able to pick up after her and I don’t want this to keep going into her adult life. Does anyone have any advice on how to get her to listen to me seriously?

TL;DR: My sister smells really bad because she doesn’t clean her room up and takes any advice from me as if I’m teasing her. I don’t know how to get her to listen.

Edit: I want to clarify that the dog is a chihuahua and her room isn’t like covered in poop or anything. It’s just that there are small areas where the dog will poop and she’ll just ignore it while she does something else. Also, she usually smells fine after she takes a bath, the problem usually rises when she gets out of her room in the morning until she bathes again (because we generally stay in the living room and hang out in the evenings so she doesn’t really go back in there).","You should say all of this to your mom and your mom should speak to her and make her accountable for actually doing her chores and keeping herself/her room clean.

I don't know if anyone wanted an update, but I kind of want to have it here to remember why I'm done with this relationship in case I stop being mad.

So the new secret friend I mentioned before? My hunch was 100% correct. Even before my ex bf and I discussed breaking up, he informs me that him and this new guy were talking about being together. They have a trip to Disney planned and are meeting in person next week.

No wonder he had no time for my grieving, he was too busy thinking about life with his new man. Yay.

So I'm officially single and officially know what I don't want in a partner now so there's that!

TL;DR Life never seems to go to plan","Well done! You deserve better and you've chosen better.

I'm so sorry for the loss of your brother. Fill your life with those that can support you through the grieving process. Your ex wasn't and will never be that.",2982,65,2021-08-11 18:41:02,p2j9dd
relationships,How to deal with my dad (50/M) moving his GF (48/F) in as a 16/F teenager?,"

My dad recently moved his partner in without asking me or my siblings if it was ok.

This has created a lot of awkwardness for us, and my 2 younger siblings keep telling me they are uncomfortable living with her because it’s like having a stranger in our house. I feel the same way. I don’t really know how to cope so I’ve just not really talked to her beyond saying hi and good night and how was your day to her. 

Recently, my dad has asked me why I haven’t talked to her more and I told him that I’m not that outgoing or talkative with strangers. He said that she wasn’t a stranger and I said she felt like one. I asked why it wasn’t ok for me to just coexist with her in the house and to just only exchange small pleasantries, and he got angry at me and said I needed to make her feel welcome. 

I just don’t know how. She seems nice, but I’ve been feeling depressed about not seeing my friends, and so I’m tired and run-down a lot. I have a bad relationship with my mom, too, so I’m wary of older women and women who are in a position to be maternal.

Tl;dr: I’m looking for advice on how to deal with my dad’s girlfriend moving in.","Honestly? Sounds like you were doing fine. 

Be polite. Be pleasant. Maybe periodically try to engage with her. 

It’s not on you, the kid, to develop a relationship with this older adult. And if you aren’t there yet, that’s fine. 

Maybe ask your dad why this is such an issue for them. What do they want to happen? What do they view as wrong here?",2908,106,2021-01-17 13:28:15,kz6fpy
relationships,My (24M) fiancé (24F) insists that we take care of her autistic younger brother. (21M) (5yrs),"My fiancé and I have talked about this a few times, and it always ends with her angry and crying. I love her so much but I cannot get past this point. Here’s the issue:

She has a younger brother I’ve known about since we’ve dated in college. He’s a very low functioning autistic, to the extent that he will need full-time supervision and care for the rest of his adult life. He’s a sweetheart and a great kid, and he and my fiancé are about as close as siblings can get. 

We want kids, but whenever we get on the topic she brings up her brother and talks about how “you won’t even notice he’s there” and that “he can really take care of himself, he just needs some supervision is all.” I’ve taken a lot of time to consider it, and as much as I like her brother, I’m not marrying her for her family. 

She wants us to take care of him alongside our children, to live with us as soon as I’m done with Med school until presumably we die. 

I’ve told her I love her brother, but I don’t want him to live with us and our kids, if we choose to have them. Her parents are two wonderful people, and I feel they are much more equipped to take care of him like they have the last 21 years. 

My position is that he will be happier and better taken care of with his parents, and that it is their responsibility to do so. As far as I’m aware they’re planning on doing this anyway, but every time my fiancé and I have this conversation it ends with tears. 

TL;DR - My fiancé wants us to take care of her autistic younger brother, I don’t think it would be best for him or us. We are not as well equipped as her parents to do so.","My friend has 2 autistic siblings who require full-time care, and their parents are older. She got married a couple years ago. One thing she made clear to her husband from when they started dating was that she was going to take over caring for her siblings one day. He decided he was okay with that and married her knowing that was their plan. This really is something that needs to be worked out before marriage though, and it’s not really an area where you two can compromise. Taking care of a disabled person is hard work, and you’ll resent her if you get forced into it, but she’ll resent you if she has to put her brother in a care home. This might be a situation where your goals are just not compatible, and it is a deal breaker.",2801,216,2021-05-15 23:56:59,ndbv44
relationships,I (30F) live in a fantasy world (married to 30M),"I have always had an active imagination and a rich fantasy life. It helps that I like to write and I'm able to bring a lot of that to my stories. But I also have a rich fantasy life that I keep to myself as sort of an escape from reality. My therapist wants me to unpack this a little and distance myself from it. And I guess I'm looking for a little perspective. 

For background, I've been married for 5 years and together 12. My husband is a good man, kind and loving. We have one child (4F). We both work full time, and we have dates and time together. In many ways I'm satisfied. But at the core, my husband and I are different people. He is not passionate and not interested in the same things I am for the most part. I also have little interest in his hobbies. So we both have inner lives that are separate from the other. 

I'll make up stories to get myself through the day. Like I'll see a stranger at the library and I imagine a meeting of the minds relationship with this complete stranger. Or I'll leave home at night and go for drives and listen to romantic songs and put myself in the lyrics. I thumb through travel websites and imagine entire lives in those places. My therapist has been gently telling me that this might be unhealthy behavior, and that I should give more thought to being present in the world. Anyone else dealing with a similar dilemma? Any advice?

relationships,UPDATE: My(30M) GF(32F) of 6 months has changed her behaviour recently and I want to leave,"OP: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/r5oop6/my30m\_gf32f\_of\_6\_months\_has\_changed\_her\_behaviour/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/r5oop6/my30m_gf32f_of_6_months_has_changed_her_behaviour/)

Some things I want to address first:

* I work at the same place I have done for years because of my anxiety, I know how to do everything at my job and it helps me feel grounded and not worry. When I said I'm basically a manager, I mean that I do sometimes fill in shifts and responsibilities for them, and we have talked about me officially being manager before, but it's not what I want. I don't want to take my work home with me and never be able to switch off like I see some of them do. That said, I do want to have some more ambition in my life going forward, and I am going to be looking at other ventures.
* My clothes: My band clothes are now back at my house, I still have the new clothes we bought as I paid for a lot of them and I plan to continue wearing them too. I can see what she meant by wanting me to wear new clothes, I just didn't like her end goal or the way she went about it. For the people thinking I dress like those goth people dancing under a bridge, I don't. It's usually just a band tee/jumper with some normal jeans, I'm not a teenager, just a 30yo who still loves the same band haha. (No hate to those dancing goths, I love that meme)

OK so on to the main story. I took advice from some of the responses to the OP, we live separately so there wasn't any issues with leases, but I did change my lock as I had given her a key a few months ago. As for the breakup, it didn't go well, but it did go at least. I was at home thinking of how to do it, which cafe/restaurant I was gonna do it in etc. She finished work and came to mine without any prior discussion, not out of the ordinary to be fair. Anyway she could tell something was off, and because I'd been thinking about it all for hours I was 150% sure I wanted to do it so just did it here instead. I first told her that I had lied about donating my clothes and that I'd actually taken them to work instead. She was angry and calling me a liar and everything. I apologized for it, and tried to explain that I felt a lot of unfair pressure to get rid of them when I didn't really want to and my collection wasn't hurting anyone. I don't really feel that the argument was fair, and I feel that her actions made me lie to her, but I hate saying stuff like that so I just left it and moved on. 

I then told her I was really annoyed about her calling my boss, she said she was sorry but I should be a manager, I said that's OK and she looked confused but accepted it I guess. Then I just said I didn't wat to be with her anymore because she actually had given me a second to speak. She looked shocked and asked me what I meant. I just said I didn't want to be with her anymore, and that I wanted her to leave and would be changing my locks but was open to calling to messaging about picking up her stuff. She said stuff like we don't have to break up but I kept saying my mind is made up and technically we already had, she called me pathetic as she walked out the door and slammed it behind her. This was the other day, I haven't heard from her but I sent her a message about picking up her stuff, there isn't much of it here so maybe she doesn't want to?

Anyway, since then, I called my boss to explain that situation and be wary of any contact from her, we've worked together for years and we're good friends so he was very understanding and said if I need help in anyway he'll try to provide it. We go for drinks often with other colleagues so I'll explain it all to them there probably. 

As for me, like I said above, I do want to work on myself a bit, partly because of the things she said, but not for the same reasons, just for me to grow a bit in terms of work experience and fashion sense. I'll be buying more 'smart causal' clothes to wear as well. I don't think I'll ever fully stop wearing the band clothes though hahahaha. I don't quite know what I want to do in terms of work, but I have the experience of team work and leadership from the store which I think is usable and transferable to other jobs too. 

I'm feeling weird, but OK, it feels great to have acted decisively, I haven't felt sad yet, not happy either just relieved mostly. Some of her stuff is still here and it feels weird to see it knowing it'll never be that way again, I don't know how to describe that feeling. Anyway I've spoken to friends about it and will be seeing them soon. Idk what she's been up to or what she'll do, not sure if I want to, there's nothing left for me with her anyway. 

Just wanted to thank everyone for their kind words in the OP, it felt really good to know I wasn't being treated fairly and I wasn't just being stupid like she said. Some even messaged me with similar stuff or how much they liked their partners with similar habits to my band clothes which was really nice. One of the reasons I still wear the band tees is sometimes other fans spot them and we'll have a nice conversation about it and always end the conversation smiling haha, it's just nice. 

&#x200B;

TL;DR GF came to my house and it took an hour or so but I broke up with her and she left. Locks have been changed and clothes returned, thins are weird but definitely better. I'll be working on myself but doing it purely for me not for her or anyone else. Thanks again for kind words and advice everyone, hope you enjoyed the story.","Not everyone wants to move up in their career. That’s ok. If you can make what you need, then that’s fine. Not everyone is cut out to be a manager. Do what you want. 
I’m glad you’re rid of your girlfriend. She was toxic and so negative. She wanted to change you to her vision of what you should be, not what you actually want.

relationships,my (14m) family is falling apart," 

Up until about March 2020, my family was fine, my parents were divorced on very good terms (had been for 9 years) But right as the covid restriction began, my dad pretty much began losing it. In turn, this really screwed up my 18 year old brother, who turned to drinking. This is how things were for a while, until about august, when my brother got a dui. Wrecking a car my dad had just bought him. And my dad isn't rich by any means. He's unemployed, with virtually no money. At this point my dad went virtually insane. Then, my dog, and cat died. Not exactly helping. Then, in december my dad finally decided to go to an impatient facility, he came out two weeks later, feeling good. For about a week. He went back a month later. Same deal, felt good a week, went back. And now we're here. He came out, same thing. But now, he's totally estranged. He told my mom ""I loathe you, fuck you."" and won't give her back the $6000 he owes her. So my mom is also financially fucked up now. My brother is in constant conflict with my mom, and my mom is crying almost everyday. I just don't know what to do, I'm mind bogglingly stressed everyday and can't focus on anything.

 tl;dr: family coming apart, dad resents mom for no reason, 18 yo brother picking up drinking","The best way to support your family is to support yourself. It sounds selfish, but if you spiral with your family, you won't be able to do anything to help at all.

You are under so much pressure, but you are not alone. You can get through this.

What can you do to take care of yourself? Would staying with friends or other family help you feel safer? Are you open to speaking with a therapist? Would finding a support group where you can speak with people in similar situations help?

Even starting just by opening up to a teacher you trust or a school counselor who can help you find the resources you need could be an excellent first step. But please do what you need to do to keep yourself safe and sane. We love you so much.",2714,79,2021-03-15 21:11:12,m5uznm
relationships,"Roommate (27F) thought I (25F) was a lesbian, finds out I’m bisexual, now wants to dictate what I can’t wear around her boyfriend. Help.","So I (25F) live with a woman (27F) who I’m gonna call “Mary”. We met each other off a Facebook roommate finding group and have lived together for two years. We live well together but we are very different and not friends. We plan to find our own places this coming May.

Mary has a boyfriend (30s?M), “Sam”. Sam is a fine guy. He’s really quiet and we sometimes chat about Marvel. He’s at our apartment a lot, like maybe five nights out of the week. They don’t bother me.

Mary and Sam are having relationship issues. Mary is VERY emotional and Sam is emotionally closed off. More than once I’ve overheard Mary crying and Sam just shutting down. 

A few months ago there was an “incident”, let’s say, where Sam left her. She was despondent for a week…then they talked, and they were together all smiles at my place! Mary said Sam hadn’t meant to leave her, that it was a misunderstanding. This doesn’t having anything to do with the story I just think it gives them some context.

So back to me. I’m bisexual. Mary has only known me with one partner, a woman. We broke up last year and I only recently started dating again. Sometime last month, I went on a date with a guy who I really liked, so when I came home I couldn’t help but gush about him to my roommate. She was surprised I was seeing a guy. I guess she just assumed I was a lesbian (I am a bit of a tomboy lol). I came out as bi. She’s also bi, so it was a pleasant conversation.

Now, this being my house and all, I do sometimes do things like walk from my bathroom wrapped in a towel, or wear pajama shorts, or work out in a sports bra. Well today, Sam’s not here and Mary sits me down. She wants me to stop walking around in a towel or bra or “sexy PJs” when Sam is here. She told me it was making them uncomfortable and I needed to respect this boundary.

I said I would have to think about this. 

I feel like it’s obvious this only became an issue once she found out the true nature of my sexuality, like I was “safe” to be around her boyfriend when she thought I was a lesbian. I’m not attracted to him nor is anything I’m wearing overtly sexual, and this is my home! I don’t want to change how I’m living because she’s insecure about the feelings of a man who doesn’t even live here.

Soooo. What do I say? What do I do?


TL;DR My roommate found out I’m bisexual, and suddenly wants to dictate what I wear around her boyfriend. How do I respond to this?","She can go to Sam’s house 5 days a week instead.
Fuck Mary. She was already weird and unfriendly, now she wants to control you as much as she controls Sam.
Maybe get a robe, but don’t change your routine for this nutter.",2707,135,2021-10-02 05:00:14,pzoraf
relationships,"*UPDATE* :My old classmate (M, 21) wants me (M,22) ""to put in a good word for him"" at my job","Edit: WOW,  last time I checked, my post had been removed, only checked now to see all this. THANK YOU ALL FOR ALL THE COMMENTS  AND SUPPORT. MUCH LOVE! <3

I figured I should make an update in case anyone who commented on my previous post  wanted to know what happened.

My previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/pbz4sp/my_old_classmate_m_21_wants_me_m22_to_put_in_a/

Anyways, I got a lot of suggestions on what to tell him (Thanks for that) and I pretty much decided on 3 things.
 #1. Tell him to send an application on the jobs portal like everyone else. 
#2. Once he applied, I would ""put in a good word for him"" (I wasn't gonna say sh*t)
#3. NOT give a single co-workers email, number, contact etc. To him. (I did send him to the company's page on LinkedIn, though, if he really wanted to talk to my co-workers).

Backtrack, as we we're talking he started asking more and more questions about my job and just other stuff, eventually I found out he was sharing with other people our convo. Cause our mutual friend and others brought some of the stuff up to me out of the blue. It was no biggie, it's just i didn't want many people to know I got a new job before I was settled in and my ex classmate went and told people behind my back. Also during our convo i sensed a hint of jealousy, because he started to downplay my job and my employer and laughed when I brought up work stuff, yet he wants to apply to where I work only after hearing the pay? It just made no sense.

So yes what happened next.

I told him step #1 and #2 but he insisted that I give him my co-workers contact info first and ""put in the good word"" then he'll pick things up from there. I said no...we went back and forth.

After that didn't work he wanted me to apply for him. (His angle was playing dumb, and thought I knew it best).

I said no he had to do it himself...he wasn't happy and tried to guilt trip me HARD. 

Eventually I said, ""if you just apply I'll help with with step #2 and #3"" it was evident he was too lazy to apply.

He said ""are you gonna help me or not?"" (Convo took a turn)

I said ""that's all I can do for now take it or leave, it's your choice""

Then he blocked me lol

TL; DR update, ex classmate blocked me after I didn't ""put in a good word for him"".

But yeah thanks guys and gals for the advice.",He wants you to do everything from application to the actual job. Nope. He's a lazy fellow. You'll destroy your name if you let this kind of employee at your job who doesn't want to do anything.,2662,85,2021-09-08 13:20:45,pkae09
relationships,Married friend (26F) can’t stop talking about my (27F) ex boyfriend,"Update: thank you all so much such amazing support and helping me see through things! I sent her a message saying how uncomfortable last night was for me, that it was not right to rub her friendship with him on my face and how it felt like she valued her relationship with my ex more than our friendship. I told her I can’t dictate who she can be friends with but that I cannot be friends with someone who’s a close friend of that one person who messed me up mentally and emotionally. I wished her the best and blocked her from everywhere. 


I have known her since we were in grade 4. We lived in the same neighbourhood and went to the same school. We were good friends till high school and eventually drifted apart. My best friend and she used to go to the same college and used to tell how she was clingy with a guy even though she had a boyfriend who went to a different college. I kept away from her and thought I would never be in touch with her but we were friends on Facebook. I finished college and moved to a different country when I learned her father had passed away. I felt really bad and reached out to her. She mentioned she was also moving to the country and we decided to meet up. My boyfriend and I met her for lunch and eventually my boyfriend and her husband became friends. I broke up with my boyfriend and she said how she would have gone after my ex if only she wasn’t married because he’s really cute. I told her what he did to me but it made no difference to her. She had plans of meeting my ex out for dinner and invited me out too. I stopped hanging out with her after that. She kept messaging me to meet quite a few times and I kept making excuses. I finally cave in and planned a dinner with her for today, but she wouldn’t stop talking about my ex. Telling how he is one of her close friends and how they keep sending each other snapchats (like it was a big deal for her). It felt really annoying I cut the dinner short and headed home. I don’t want to be friends with her anymore. How should I tell her that I don’t want to be friends with her without hurting her feelings? How do I stay away from her?

Tldr: married friend became close friend of my ex after we broke up and keeps talking about him every time we meet.",Girl you're still worried about sparing her feelings after all of this???

relationships,UPDATE: My (23M) coworker (21M) is a really great guy. How do I stop jealousy from ruining our friendship?," Update to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/qjztwf/my_23m_coworker_21m_is_a_really_great_guy_how_do/) post.

In my last post I basically said that I'm jealous my coworker gets flirted with a lot, and I ended up turning down an invite to hang out with him because of my insecurities.

Well, I decided to ask him yesterday if I could take him up on that offer of watching movies like he previously mentioned. He smiled really big and genuine and said he'd love it. Why not tonight?

I couldn't believe he actually said yes, and even wanted to do it THAT NIGHT. No excuses, no pushing it back for weeks. I was fucking ecstatic.

We couldn't decide on a film, so we started talking about TV shows, and decided to just watch Breaking Bad, since we'd both watched it and enjoyed it before.

Tbh we talked through most of it, but it felt amazing to just be able to let go and be comfortable around him outside of work.

Thanks to everyone who talked to me and helped me!

TLDR; I decided to ask my coworker to hang out and it was great. Hopeful for the future","That's great!

When you're a bit more friendly with him, and you start talking about relationships, just don't lie to him. Tell him the truth. You're insecure and you never had a real GF.

He sounds like a good guy, he'll probably offer to be your wingman!

Don't be jealous of your friends. They are there to push you up, not to bring you down. So push him up and he'll do the same for you.",2568,34,2021-11-05 06:11:54,qn4rsl
relationships,How do I (25M) to support my newly paralyzed girlfriend (25f)?,"My girlfriend was recently in a car crash and the outcome is not good. 

The doctors ran their tests and scans. The results of those scans, not good. Her spinal cord was damaged in the T10 and it is a grade a. Which means she is paralyzed from the waist area down with no function. 

This is a huge life changing thing for her. Before, she was a model, we played golf and tennis, ran, hiked and traveled a lot. 

How do I support her through this?

TL;DR - My girlfriend was just paralyzed, how do I support her?","Hey, kid of a paralized dad here. My dad was in a road accident, too when he was 27yo and is paralized pretty much from his bellybutton downwards. The scars the Opa rations left and the obvious impact on his life really hit him hard back then.

One of the worst things he sais that happened in that time were that only his youngest brother came to visit regularly, he felt really alone. All his hobbies were shattered along with his back and only his younger brother came to care.

His girlfriend at this time came in once to tell him, that this is all too much for her to bear, so she left him.

The fist months he was incapable of doing anything alone and he hated it. He hated the pity he saw in people's eyes, and he hated what his life was now.
So he changed it.

For now all you can do for her is be there. When she has a good day, you can show her what wheelchair users are capable of. Aren Fotheringham is a good example for this, but even on the lesser extreme side of things, with just a few adjustments a wheelchair user can do just about everything anyone can. Just differently.

When you get out of the hospital help her do the paperwork. Collect and bring papers whenever possible, so she doesn't have to be confronted with things she cannot overcome just yet like stairs or even elevators, when she is in a lying down wheelchair, as my dad had to be a few weeks after surgeries.

When she gets fit enough to sit again make sure she gets a good wheelchair. Those are her legs. Don't save on that. If you need help on what to look out for regarding wheelchair fit dm me, I worked for a company that handbuild tailored wheelchairs, as does my dad.

I can imagine getting back into tennis or golf could be either very good or very bad. You know your girlfriend better to know what type of person she is.
But as she obviously likes sports, try and find a sport she enjoys. Almost all sports are with a few rule adjustments possible to do from a wheelchair.

And most importantly: Don't help her go through her day. Help her figuring out how to do so herself.

I grew up with a wheelchair as a hobby. My dad taught me how to balance it on two wheels, how to get up curbs, how to ride escalators, how to go down stairs. As long as something is not out of reach, or to small for her wheelchair to fit, she can learn how to do everything her daily life might throw at her.

For most wheelchair users I know this is the most vital part. Getting your independence back, being able to live without someone's help, and seeing just how much they are still capable of doing.

Edit: thank you guys for all the nice comments, dms and awards. I just woke up to see all the responses and it already made my day start out great!",2528,64,2021-10-09 17:37:52,q4q1jg
relationships,UPDATE: I (28/F) need some advice on how to cope with a difficult coworker/boss (40s/F).,"My [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/j3bekh/i_28f_need_some_advice_on_how_to_cope_with_a/) didn't get a lot of attention, but I figured I'd share an update anyway.

I figured out some good techniques to apply to our working relationship (through the help of a book about dealing with difficult people), and had gotten to a point where she wasn't driving me so crazy anymore. She went from being someone that I absolutely *hated* and could barely work with to just my least favorite person in the office, but no more than that.

But then today, I was informed by one of the other bosses that she no longer works for our firm! Apparently I wasn't just being over-sensitive or not meshing with her style as a boss, but  was correct in thinking that she was difficult to work with to the point of incompetence. 

tl;dr: I mostly figured out how to deal with the difficult coworker/boss, but then she got fired.",Good for you. You learn to be a better coworker. And your problem magically goes away. That's a double win.,2528,31,2021-01-04 17:30:16,kqdcl7
relationships,(UPDATE) My (36M) family is upset I'm 'prioritizing' my BIL over my niece after my sister (27F) cheated.,"Link to original [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/nsbhlr/my_36m_family_is_upset_im_prioritizing_my_bil/)

Firstly, thank you everyone for your comments, messages, insights and support. It really helped me strengthen my resolve and find solace in what I was doing. I'll address a few concerns/questions that popped up before my mini-update.

Yes, Bill knows Jane is his. When Tom got his paternity test done, he and Bill had him go separately to be tested.

Why am I letting Tom stay with me? Well..he was family for years and for me, you don't just chuck family onto the streets except for extreme situations. Divorce takes a year in my state and Tom is opting to stay to make sure it can all be handled quickly and smoothly to get it finalized as soon as possible. That said, he plans on moving back to his homestate after that so I am letting him stay with me so he can save money for his move and moving expenses. Otherwise, the only places he could afford on his own require 6 and 12 month leases.

Supporting Tom and Bill may result in my sister and I having little to no contact. True, it may, and that'll be our crosses to bear but I can't find it in me to ignore others needing help just to satiate her and excuse her behavior. I still love my sister, whatever my feelings or opinions of what she did or is doing have no place in this, nor is it really the time for me to go expressing them to her. Bill's lawyer says its very likely Bill will wind up with a custody arrangement and he has assured me that if things do go south with my sister that she won't let me see my niece, I'd always be welcome to visit them to see her during his time with her.

Now for the update..its not a huge one but rather surprising. My sister is still being cranky and doubling down, doing all she can to guilt Tom into reconciling and adamant about Bill not being involved because 'she has a husband that just needs to realize they can work through this, Tom is Jane's dad and Bill is not needed'. So..meh there. Last week I went on a fishing trip with both Tom and Bill for the three of us to just relax and forget all this nonsense for a bit. Once we got back my mother showed up to try talking to me about why I am doing any of this.

Surprisingly, we had a decent talk after some heated tension. I wound up showing her the post and while she wasn't happy I was airing our laundry, it helped a bit. Ultimately I was able to get it through to her that given the circumstances and the high probability Bill is going to be a presence in Jane's life from here on out, the best thing for Jane would be if our family and Bill could at least co-exist. I asked her how she would feel if her granddaughter was constantly having to choose who to spend time with for birthdays, graduation, prom pictures, etc, or gods forbid, we all put her in a position that she would have to lie to everyone about what she wanted just to not hurt feelings. It took a while but that seemed to at least get through to her a bit. She's still not happy about the whole situation, but she did agree to a dinner in a public place to meet Bill and some of his family and I'm happy to say that that wound up going off really well and Bill's mother had a good heart to heart with her. So, some progress. Thanks again everyone for the support.

TLDR: My sister is still trying to pressure my BIL into reconciling and mad at me for supporting BIL and her daughter's father, but my mother is at least making some progress towards accepting my niece's biological father.","Damn. 

So your sister lied to both of these men for years and now expects them and everyone else to bend to her will? It sounds like you, Tom, and Bill have Jane's best interests in mind more your sister or parents do. 

Kudos to you for doing the right thing.",2394,52,2021-06-21 17:05:51,o4zzmz
relationships,My [26m]'s girlfriend [24f] wants to break up because of my disability,"Hi all, honestly I know how this is probably going to go but I wanted to make this post to get other people's opinions and maybe get some help so I know what I can personally do better to avoid something similar in the future.

Obligatory I'm on mobile so please be lenient.

I've got cerebral palsy that affects both my legs and one arm. That's my official diagnosis but what you really see is I walk with a limp. I'm a software developer so job wise, I don't have any issues. I knew when I was a kid that using my brain is the best way for me to survive on my own without relying on other people. I haven't had the chance to get my driver's license but according to therapists and doctors that shouldn't be an issue. That's the background about me.

My girlfriend and I have been together for a year. We met back in April 2020 of last year and we decided to get together in May 2020. I told her about my disability before then but she wanted to try and make it work. We video call on discord every day almost always when we're awake and recently we've been going on dates. She's more then happy to lend me an arm and she notices things about me that even I miss myself. Outside of my family she's the most loving and caring person I know and she's my motivation to do better and improve myself. Honestly, I never thought I could find someone I trusted enough to share my more negative thoughts and problems. I always tried to seem happy so I don't worry others. The emotional support she gives me is really irreplaceable.

The problem is is scared that, in the future she will have to take care of me or most of the work will fall onto her. To make matters worse her mom has been telling her for the past few weeks to break up with me because she can find better and she doesn't want her to have the burden of caring for me. She's also really afraid that I will get arthritis early due to my cerebral palsy and if that happens, a lot is going to be on her.

I've tried doing things like stretches and exercises to maintain and improve my muscle tone but she is still afraid I'll get worse. 

Reddit, please help. I'm an introvert I don't know a lot of people and honestly I don't even know the options I've got to look at. I want to prove that I can be independent and that if things do go wrong, it won't just be on her. I'm in Ontario Canada. Are there things I can look into and do to assist with my disability or things I can look into so if things do go wrong, I won't be a burden on her?

Please Reddit, I'm at the end of my wits. I've never really hated my disability but I've always kept myself going by being tempering my expectations and thinking, ""my disability is going to make it really hard to find someone"" and she's the first person to make me feel like ""ya, it doesn't matter"". I want to do anything to show her that I won't hold her back in the future but I'm out of ideas. Is there anything I can do?

I don't want to worry anyone I'm with with these issues but I'm at the end of my wits. Please Reddit, I need ideas. I don't even know if my relationship is lost but I don't want this to happen again and I want to know what I can do myself so I can reassure my partner so they know I won't hold them back in the future.

Has anyone had similar experiences? Maybe there are resources that I can tap into? I don't know if there are things I can look into to better plan my future so it's not a concern 
for my partner. I really need help. 

The worst part is, I've always thought my disability doesn't matter. But with all of this happening it's really hard to convince myself otherwise. 

TL;DR I've got a permanent disability and I don't know how to reassure my girlfriend that I can handle myself in the future.","Ok I can see I'm gonna be the outlier here but I'm not sure this is actually about your disability at all, at least at the core of it. I'm reading a lot of things that tell me you are overly dependent on her emotionally. 


>Outside of my family she's the most loving and caring person I know and she's my motivation to do better and improve myself. Honestly, I never thought I could find someone I trusted enough to share my more negative thoughts and problems. I always tried to seem happy so I don't worry others. The emotional support she gives me is really irreplaceable.


This can be great but if she's the only person you are sharing your negativity with it can also be a lot, and just because she's a caring person doesn't mean it doesn't affect her. You have said stuff like you don't have your license (why not? Who drove you places before? Does she drive you now?) And that she's the reason you smile (being responsible for someone else's happiness is a huge burden). I suspect that she's already feeling some caregiver fatigue from the emotional stuff and having her mom whisper in her ear that you may someday need physical help as well is just a bridge too far for her. Hypothetically getting arthritis early because you have mild cerebral palsy which manifests as a limp just doesn't sound like a serious deal breaker to me if someone is really into you. 


I would say that in addition to being proactive about your condition, you need to get a larger support network so she's not your only emotional outlet. If you can't talk to anyone else about your problems, hire a therapist. I also think more independence (getting your license, moving ahead on buying that house, etc) will show that you are and will be capable of handling your own shit when the time comes more than taking her to talk to a specialist or something like that.  Besides my gut feeling is that this particular girl is probably not worth chasing after (not that she's not worth it but that chasing after someone who isn't into it anymore is a losing game). These lifestyle changes will make you much more attractive to the next person that comes along and less desperate to keep them.",2366,134,2021-05-22 04:47:04,niaytx

I just decided to tell him to stop making those jokes. He listened to me apologized for making them and said he would stop. He wrote me a sweet letter telling me that I was his type.  He hasn't made one that particular joke once but he started to make a lot more jokes calling himself an idiot. 

I again asked him why he was doing it and he said it was just jokes but it didn't feel like it. I finally sat him down asked if he felt okay and happy? I remember one of the commenter saying that he may have been unhappy in the relationship and that had gotten to me. He said he happy with our relationship but he was not happy with himself and he felt deeply lost and he constantly keeps critiquing himself. He said everything he did comes back to haunt him. 

I have realized that he has a very low opinion of himself which I find tragic as he has so much to offer to the world. so many people look up at him and love him but he probably feels like he doesn't deserve it. He is going to get a referral to a therapist. 

I feel a bit insecure because I feel like I contributed to his problems. I am sometimes critical of him but apparently he doesn't mind that because he feels relived when he knows what exactly he has done wrong? I don't understand this completely but I think I will just try to be there for him. I hope he feels better about himself. He is the person that makes me the happiest and I want him to be happy too.  

TLDR : My boyfriend corrected his behavior but continued to make other self deprecating jokes. He seems to have sever self esteem issues. He is planning to go therapy.",">I feel a bit insecure because I feel like I contributed to his problems.

One of the worst parts about having low self-esteem is that it's easy to assume that everyone around you is mad about every single thing you do, and your imagination can get pretty creative at coming up with plausible scenarios where it makes sense that they would be mad. When that happens, it can feel like waking up from a nightmare when they say ""It's kind of frustrating that you haven't taken the trash out yet"" and you realize that the only problem was actually very minor and easy to handle.",2357,48,2021-07-28 17:50:28,otf3wb
relationships,My( F 21) fiancé’s (M 23) best man just told my fiancé he hates me!?," So long story short... 

My fiancé’s best man (we’ll call him Liam) recently told my fiancé that he hates me. Liam hasn’t said much about why he doesn’t like me other than the fact that i’m supposedly holding a grudge over him, treat him like shit and don’t talk to him. For me personally i have loved this guy! I thought he was a great best friend to my fiancé, we’ve all been on trips together, he was super excited for us to get married and even posted on social media and privately expressed to us how proud he was to be apart of our wedding when my fiancé asked him to be his best man. It honestly came as a shock to me and my fiancé to find out Liam can’t stand me, it was very out of the blue... Liam told my fiancé he would still come to the wedding if that’s what my fiancé wanted but made it very clear he would only be there for him and not us. There has been no incidents that i’m aware of that could cause this to happen. I’m honestly torn up and have been feeling an all time low. It sucks to find out that someone i love and care about has secretly hated me. 

Oh and not to mention , our wedding is a month out! What do i do? 
I know for sure i want him there because no matter what i still have love for the guy, but i don’t want to make liam feel awkward and be apart of something he supposedly doesn’t care about...

TL;DR : My fiancé’s best man said he hated me out of the blue and i have no idea what to do

Edit: I’m getting a lot of...
1. How does my fiancé feel? 
2. I’m withholding information
3. That this is a the similar“Love Actually” (Never seen the movie, will definitely be checking it out now) 
4. We’re  too young and this is high school drama 
5. Lack of info about Liams status in personal relationship and where my fiancé stands in the friend group. 

My fiancé is crushed. He feels that if Liam was able to do secretly hide this , what else could he have been lying about and or if he really believes Liam when he said this stuff. He is crushed for me as well because he knows how close me and best man were. 

The information i was given about this convo was very reliable. This conversation happened via text between the two of them and i have read the whole conversation. I know texting can be very misleading , if just having trouble knowing that he was saying such and such about me and we have no idea why. 

Yes, we are young. I know this and so does my Fiancé. We’ve been together since i was 16 , almost 17 and have never questioned one another when it came to our feelings for one another. We have had the support of each other’s families and friends through this whole relationship, including Liam , which is why this was a shock. Regarding this being a drama situation due to us being young, this has been the first hiccup, a shocking one which is why we didn’t know how to handle it. This happened two days ago and my fiancé messaged him yesterday about meeting up and talking in person and he got no response, my fiancé took it as Liam maybe needed time or that Liam might’ve have realized what he said was out of the blue and doesn’t know what to say now. 

Liam is single, had been for a long time. No actual serious relationships. My fiancé is the first one in the friend group to be getting married so i found the advice about that maybe being and issue to be very helpful. 

To wrap it up, I have not yet contacted Liam because he won’t even reach back out my fiancé. I feel hurt and i feel awful for my fiancé. I agree, something does seem fishy and i’m wondering what it could be, so wanting to have answers is definitely heavy on my mind. Thank you to everyone who have reached out so far and given there advice, we both very much appreciate it.","I'm going to disagree with others on Liam being gay, and it rubs me the wrong way that so many people are jumping to that conclusion without any evidence. Sometimes men don't like women and they can hate a particular woman without being gay. He could, as some others have suggested, simply be jealous (still straight) and worried that his friend getting married means a radical change in their friendship. Maybe he is really feeling apprehension and isn't putting the right word to it. 

That being said, how do you know this isn't just a misunderstanding? Sometimes people just have such radically different personalities that behavior that one person might consider endearing or affectionate, another might consider as obnoxious. If it were me personally, I'd reach out to Liam myself and try to clear the air and let him know that you really liked him and finding this out was upsetting to you. Not to blame him, but just maybe to find out whether there wasn't some kind of misunderstanding. 

If he genuinely hates you and has been lying to your face this whole time, tbh is it really appropriate for him to attend your wedding? I wouldn't feel comfortable with him there if I were in your position, because I may be preoccupied with him rather than focusing on the important occasion",2299,116,2021-07-04 05:27:25,ode0gj
relationships,My (29f) husband (39m) doesn't get that meeting my needs and running errands isn't self care for Moms.,"My husband seems to think that stuff like having a quick shower after going without for 5 days, running into the grocery store by myself for 25 minutes, or getting a quick basic haircut after 2 years of not getting it done, or simply any time where he is watching the kids all count towards my self care ""me time""...

I kind of think that this stuff just counts as maintaining basic hygiene and doing chores/errands. 

My husband goes out for a few drinks 2-4 times a month. So tonight he's going out and I said I was jealous, it sounds nice to go out a have a few drinks without the kids. I don't really get to do stuff like that for me. 

He said that I am going to a Drs appointment tomorrow and that's for me, it's something I wanted to do. I told him a DRs appointment isn't the same as going out for drinks, it's not enjoyable or stress relieving. He just kinda brushed it off. I'm still so mad that he thinks those 2 things are at all equal.

I just don't know how to get it through his head that I need actual time for stress relief. He always acts like if I want to go out for a coffee or have a glass of wine and have a nice bath or something that I'm taking extra time on top of all the ""me time"" he thinks I'm already getting. Like I am unfairly burdening him with watching the kids when he already works 8hrs a day. 

He just was on 3.5 months of parental leave and said it's so stressful watching the kids 24/7 and would give me breaks a lot. I thought he finally understood what it's like. How do I make him get it? Taking time for myself isn't nice when I know I'll just get lectured on how the kids were screaming and it was so hard on him the whole time.

TL:DR
My husband thinks any time he is watching the kids is self care, stress relief time for me. How do I get him to understand it's not?","\> Taking time for myself isn't nice when I know I'll just get lectured on how the kids were screaming and it was so hard on him the whole time.

Don't give into the guilt trip. I'm sure they scream when you are watching them and it's hard for you too. Such is the life of a parent.

relationships,My [27M] girlfriend [27F] of three years told my mom that she doesn’t think it’ll work between us. I’m abroad finishing a trip and dreading coming home to be broken up with. How should I react?,"tl;dr how to react healthily to an impending breakup that I cannot reveal I know about to my partner?

To be honest I’d been considering breaking up as well. Our sex life has been poor by my measure for months. She has been waiting for a proposal that I feel we’re nowhere near ready for. 

But, and this is selfish, I have never felt safer than with her. She cuddles me and strokes my head and tells me she loves and believes in me. She helps me improve and wants me to be better than I already am. 

I struggle with depression and I really don’t know if I can go back to being alone after three years of this safety. 

Moreover, I took an extra week on a family vacation and let everyone go back including her while I travelled for a week. She apparently told my mom on the flight back that “she thinks this will be her last trip with my family and that things won’t work out with me”. She also asked my
Mom not to tell me so as not to ruin the remainder of my trip but Mom didn’t want to keep secrets from me. I understand my mom’s reasoning but now it’s all I can think of and I’m going to obsess over this. I’m freaking out.

Edit: just to be clear I did ask, twice, if she would like to join me. I just love Italy, I don’t really regret having made the choice to stay.",It sounds like she senses you’re just keeping her around as a security blanket and she knows the relationship has run its course.

relationships,UPDATE: Going to confess my (23F) feelings to my long time friend (28M),"[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ph0tow/going_to_confess_my_23f_feelings_to_my_long_time/)

I remember that someone asked about update and it is always nice to share good news! :)

So, TLDR is quite easy: I did confessed my feelings eventually and it looked like my friend shared similar feelings! We agreed to pomote our friendship and try this couples thingy. :)

But I almost messed this up in every possible way. We had dinner and for few hours I was not able to force myself to start this topic at all. We almost parted our ways but as we were talking in front of restaurant we figured out noone has better things to do on Friday evening this time. So we agreed to spend some more time together. We went to 2 other places to drink and dance a little and me being me - I still was not able to say anything. That was just heart breaking at this point.

I had a last chance, he told me earlier about some projects he was working on so I asked if I could see it. We went to his place, had one more glass of wine and were chilling for a bit. At one point we were teasing one another (in a playful way) and messing around. He was tickling me and to make him stop I pinned him down. I have no idea what I was thinking at that time but I kissed him! I immidiately panicked and backed off and he was like - *what was that*? I was scared like hell, but I told him that we have this unique bond and for some time I was feeling like I would like something more and asked him if he could see us as a couple.

He told me that he really appreciates our friendships and trusts me a lot and then complimented me a little. But next thing he told me was really earth-shattering. Basically he didn't thought I might be into him romantically. He reminded me about one conversation we had. It was after my last breakup. I said something like there are no man I am really attracted to (which was straight up lie - I was attracted to him, just couldn't admit that) and because of that he was never thinking we could be a couple nor anything like that. I told him it was stupid thing to say then and I am attracted to him.

So yeah he proposed for us to try this and we kissed. I felt so happy and relieved and I started crying a little. But he was really comforting about it. And then one thing led to another and hmm.. I was really great end of the day and all.

So long story short - we are meeting today again for a real date. It will be a little bit weird as we already have trust and intimacy (from our friendship) that is usually build during dating. But it is nice to try it. I cannot wait - I think I was never so happy!","So you go to dinner, dancing, wine, tickling each other at his place alone, and he still didn't have the idea that you might be into him because you said something about men in general right after a breakup?

Ladies, we men need your help. If you are into us, let us know. Even private wine tickling at his place isn't enough to get it through our heads.",2263,43,2021-09-05 11:57:36,pibsp5
relationships,I (29M) need to establish some new boundaries after my mom (57F) was aggressive towards my wife (28F). Would it be appropriate to talk to my dad (57M) about it first?,"My wife is pregnant and my mother offered to throw her a baby shower. This has now turned into a dramatic nightmare. My relationship with my mom is already strained because she has never been a kind person, and she has some narcissistic tendencies. This week she told my wife what she planned on doing for the big food item at the shower. My wife said it sounded good, then said if my mom still needed sides and treats, my wife found a mom's craving table idea, and sent 4 snack-like items she has been craving. My mom then snapped at her and said ""Did I ask for your input? Why don't you just show up and be happy?"" We were very taken aback and I have no idea where it came from. It is kind of the last straw and I want to set some new boundaries. My mother needs to know that she doesn't get to see her grandchild unless we say she can, and for her to be invited she cannot act like that. Would it be appropriate to talk to my dad about this first? My thought is I want to explain that he didn't do anything wrong and I'm sorry if this affects how much he gets to see his grandchild (my parents are still married)


TL;DR on top of an already rocky relationship with me, my mother was aggressive towards my wife out of nowhere, and new boundaries are needed. Would it be appropriate to talk to my dad about my thoughts first?","No.  You go directly to your mom and you do it without your wife present.  You can speak to your parents together, but you tell them the boundaries and why and you also, with the wife’s permission here, tell her the shower she is throwing is cancelled, or you just won’t be there.   I’m surprised you haven’t said anything to your mom in that moment or yet about the way ag spoke to your wife.",2188,87,2021-08-01 13:42:45,ovsci3
relationships,How can I (17F) thank my step mother (41F) for everything she has done for me?,"Hi everyone,

Yes it’s a throwaway, english is not my native language and I’m kind of writing this While waiting for my oven dish to be grilled well, so sorry if there are any spelling mistake.


My story is quite ‘strange’. My father (45M) and Anna have been together for a bit more than 18 years. Before that my Dad and my mom had a fling that lasted 3 months and then it ended and he met Anna.

My mom and dad didn’t talk until I was 3, so both my dad and Anna were unaware of my existance. My mother didn’t want to tell him, or didn’t care. I don’t know. What i do know is that when I was 3 she contacted him, a DNA test was done and she basically forced us to have a relationship.

While this was a shock to my father, Who suddenly had a 3 year old walking around his house, it probably was a bigger shock to Anna. Who thought that she had just moved in with a child less man yet she got both a boyfriend and a toddler.

Anna has been, from Day 1, a brillant person. I always felt welcome, she drove me to school, to the doctor’s, to playdates, to hockey practice. She thaught me to ride à bike, included me in everything yet gave me and my dad the space to have our own relationship as father and daughter.

She never imposed herself, she never made the decisions which concerned me, she left that for my dad and mother. She always talked respectfully of my mother, even when I was mad at my mom. Even when my mom Said mean things about her, Anna never said mean things about her.

My relationship with my mother is not good. But I am happy to have Anna in my life. I see and hear from friends with stepparents how difficult it can be. I read and hear about kids who were ignored because their parent’s new partner didn’t want to them be a part of their lives.

I was wondering how I can express my gratitude to Anna for everything she die to me?

EDIT: Oh my God, this blew up. Sorry I didn’t read this sooner. It’s almost midnight here but I will try to answer each and every one of you.


Tl;dr: How to thank my stepmom?","Write her a letter telling her how much she means to you, and how grateful you are for everything she's done for you.",2151,90,2021-07-08 17:41:34,ogcady
relationships,My (28F) uncle (49M) is fixated on the idea of my husband (28M) having a mistress and getting him to say he would leave me if his mistress was pregnant.,"My cousin is pregnant with a married man’s baby. It’s been a huge scandal in our family, but my uncle has been doing his hardest to convince everyone that my cousin is the real victim in this situation. He thinks that the married man, who has small children with his wife, should abandon them and take care of my cousin and their baby instead.

For some unexplainable reason, he has latched onto my husband to try and push this narrative that the married man has more obligation to his mistress than his wife. At first, my uncle coaxed my husband into agreeing by not giving him the whole story. I was furious and exploded at him which made my cousin cry.

Now, my uncle is obsessed with the idea of my husband having a mistress.

In 2019, we took a family vacation with my extended family. During that vacation, my husband got a lot of female attention. This isn’t unusual for him; he has always got a lot of attention, so he’s used to it. There was this one particular girl though, that brazenly invited my husband to her room in front of my uncles/cousins. My uncle keeps bringing it up and mentioning how my husband must get a lot of invites like that and travelling alone must get lonely at times. Pre-COVID my husband used to travel a lot and sometimes for long stretches.

He also has outright said that my husband is in the perfect position to have several mistresses and he doubts he would ever get caught. He has asked him if he has a second family in a different country and has “jokingly” suggested he leave if his other “wife” is better looking than me.

One of the worst parts is that two of my male cousins have asked my husband if they can have the numbers of anyone he is bored with because they believe he is fooling around because my uncle is going on about it with so much confidence so often.

I’m honestly at my breaking point here. My husband has outright told my uncle that what he is saying is inappropriate, but my uncle tries to act like it’s all one big joke. I can’t go no contact with my uncle because my elderly grandparents live with him and he won’t let me see them if I do.

What are my other options here? How can I make him stop?

TL;DR – My cousin is pregnant with a married man’s baby. Now my uncle is obsessed with implying my husband is having an affair and that if he gets his mistress pregnant, he should leave me for her.","My ultimate advice is to make a huge thing about it. Next time he brings it up say something like

“Why do you think cheating on your spouse is okay? Is there someone you’d like to tell us Uncle? Is this your way of telling us that you have a secret affair-child that you have hidden away? Or that your current wife actually use to be your mistress?”

Lets see how much he likes it. You and your husband, and your mother apparently, have already tried being civil about this. If he can say it to you, why can’t you say it to him?",2145,89,2021-05-07 17:04:40,n73ed6
relationships,My(30M) GF(32F) of 6 months has changed her behaviour recently and I want to leave,"So I met her earlier this year, we were fast friends within a month of meeting and dating after a month, official for 6 months or so. Met her on a night out with some friends. 

We live separately but she spends a lot of time at my house as it's nearer to where she works. Our relationship started really nicely, I felt like we just got on really well and she was very supportive of me as well. But recently she's been quite pushy about me making changes to my lifestyle and seems angry and disappointed with the results. The two big ones are my work and what I wear.

As for my work, I work at the same store I've worked at since I was 16, it's just an easy job, pays my bills and I know how to do everything there, I'm basically a manager without the responsibility of actually being a manager as I don't want that level of responsibility for no extra pay. I also make money via stocks and crypto currencies so I don't struggle for money.

As for what I like to wear? I have many jumpers and T shirts of an emo band my friends and I loved when we were young, I genuinely have like 50 or so that I wear a lot because it makes me happy, and doesn't hurt anyone either.

I admit I have a bit of a problem with anxiety, familiarity helps me with it, some family thinks I might have OCD but I've never been diagnosed. 

My girlfriend a few weeks ago expressed frustration with my clothes, saying I need to grow up and get new ones. She spends a lot of money to get whatever clothes are in fashion, I don't have a problem with that as it's her money to spend and she isn't hurting anyone. But I don't know why she has a problem with my clothes. The argument was big but resolved and we went shopping and bought me some new clothes, they are actually quite nice and I like wearing them too. A few days later I was wearing a band T shirt again because the new clothes were in the wash and she was really angry about it. I explained the new clothes were in the wash and it wasn't decided that I'd completely stop wearing the band stuff. She wouldn't talk to me for the rest of the day, the next day she had cooled off and explained that she thinks new clothes will help me grow as a person. We talked a long time and I eventually agreed to get rid of the band clothes. 

While I was packing them up I started crying and she called me stupid and I asked her to leave. She came back a few hours later and we made up, I packed the boxes into my car and told her I was gonna donate them, she was really pleased and said I was making the right choice getting rid of them. I didn't donate them, I took them to work and I'm keeping them there until further notice, my boss was confused but understanding. I got back home and she'd ordered my lots of new clothes. She told me she understands it was upsetting but I'd be better off for it. That night a few hours later she wanted to talk about my work and why I'm not a manager. I explained to her that I don't want to be.

She's been distant and only talks about how I should ask to be a manager, I've explained why I don't want to be, and that I wouldn't even be paid more, nor is there a need for it at the store. She just keeps saying that I need to fight for a pay rise as well so I can treat us to nice things. I told her that isn't how it works and that I make money in other ways and that she has her own money too so it shouldn't matter. She shouted at me that I'm useless and stormed out. My boss also told me she called the store and asked him why I'm not a manager.

After being upset and feeling useless for a few hours I decided that I don't want to be with her. I realized I don't see my friends as much as I used to because she likes to spend all our free time just us.  I just don't feel happy with her anymore and feel like she actually acted differently when we started out just to get close to me, she even said she loved all the band stuff when I first showed her. I think she may be right that new clothes might help me a bit, I genuinely appreciate that and like how I look in some of the clothes we bought. But I also liked how I looked in the band stuff, and still think it wasn't over the top, I'd normally just wear jeans and a T shirt or jumper anyway, I don't think it's as ridiculous as she said it was. I just thought of it as a wearable collection, people collect weirder things.

As well as this, I really don't like that I lied to her about donating the band stuff, it felt horrible and dishonest, my boss and colleagues could tell something was off when I took the boxes into work. I try to be honest as I don't want to upset people.

\*\*TLDR\*\* my gf of 6 months has become controlling and angry at me and made me get rid of some clothes that are special to me, is also trying to get me to become a manager at my work, even called my boss to ask about it. I've decided I want to leave her but I'm scared to because she can be manipulative and angry.

Anyway, I want to break up with her but I know it's gonna be difficult, she's good at talking me into stuff but my mind is made up 100% on this. I'm still not sure when or how to do it though, I'm feeling really anxious about it. Wondering if you guys can give me some advice or help? How can I be assertive about wanting to break up and not have her talk me out of it?","Yes, I think you are right to break up with her. She crossed all sorts of lines, IMO.

It’s fine that she made some suggestions on clothing, and even that she expressed that she preferred that while in public. But asking you to get rid of them all together?! Or to not wear it while lounging around the house, or at the gym or doing yard work type of thing?! That’s crossing the line into controlling.

It’s ok for her to ask about your position at work. But calling your boss?!? That’s a MAJOR line she crossed there. That’s completely unacceptable. She was treating you like a child. That’s highly disrespectful…

It takes two people to decide to be in a relationship. It takes one to decide to break up. When you go to have the conversation - just remember that you aren’t asking for her permission or for her to agree - you are simply informing her of your decision.

Personally, I’m not a fan of the “in public” advise unless you feel she may be violent. Just get together with her when you can, inform her of your decision, give her a few minutes (maybe 10 or 20) to ask questions as needed and then cut it off. The whole conversation need not last more than 20 minutes…",2129,267,2021-11-30 14:40:04,r5oop6

I did propose to my partner after all. And he said yes.

It took me a while to get rid of all my doubts and fear. But in the end I came to the conclusion that I want to live my life like every day is the last one. We can overcome the financial obstacles. I believe we'll be fine. And I believe he'll be fine if I'm gone.

We decided to have a very small wedding, only the closest friends and a couple of my husband's relatives. Partly because I just had my first chemo and I'm barely alive. But also because that's the best company. We don't need anyone or anything else. 

Anyway, thank you for all the advice under my last post. You all are very kind.

TL;DR I proposed to my partner and he said yes.","Congratulations to you both! I wish you much happiness!



Not to be a downer but I would like to suggest that your partner gets a counselor/therapist/ group for themselves. All too often the spouse/caregiver will play the stoic, strong role and neglect their own mental and/or emotional needs. I lost my first wife to cancer when she and I were in our twenties. I neglected my well-being when it was happening and having basically lived in an oncology ward for a couple years noticed it’s a pretty common thing. If either of y’all ever want to talk to someone who has been through it, you can message me anytime. I’d be happy to share my experiences or just listen.
