mentalhealth,Thank you to the woman who rang me out at Target. You saved my life üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è,"I went to target and picked out birthday cards for my parents, siblings, and all my nieces and nephews for everyone‚Äôs birthdays next year. I was planning on killing myself after I filled them out. They lady at target who rang me out asked why I was buying so many (I have a big family) I told her I was dying and they‚Äôre for my family when I‚Äôm gone. I‚Äôm sure she thought I had cancer or something. But still. She started to get emotional and started crying then she made me cry. Telling me all kinds of nice things and that my family loves me very much üò≠üò≠ we ended up hugging each other sobbing. After I collected myself in my car I decided to give it another shot just for her. She was so sweet. She indeed saved my life. So thank you to the target employee you have no idea how far your kind words reached ‚ù§Ô∏è I am so grateful ü•≤","Forgive me if I‚Äôm stating the obvious or sounding trite, but have you considered telling her boss that the employee saved your life? It would make the employee‚Äôs day and it might set her up for promotion.

I realize I‚Äôm being hopelessly na√Øve and insensitive. Then again, it would be a way for you to bless someone who blessed you.",2715,53,2021-11-13 03:49:11,qssml4

mentalhealth,My doctor asked ‚ÄúDo you even want to get better?‚Äù in response to me saying I‚Äôm not in therapy because I can‚Äôt afford it,"I‚Äôm fuming. She told me I need to tighten my belt and sacrifice other things (like what? Food? Rent?) so I can go to therapy. She (a fucking well-paid *doctor*) told me a story about how was told she needed to see the chiropractor every week for $45 a session, and while she felt that was too much, she just had to ‚Äòmove things around‚Äô to make it work.

Last time I was in therapy it cost me $150 a week *with insurance*. The session I just had with her cost me $100, not to mention the cost of all my meds. It‚Äôs fucking insane how much all of this costs already. Am I supposed to find that amount under the couch cushions?

And what is the insinuation here? Because I‚Äôm poor, I *deserve* to suffer from mental illness? You don't think I *want* to be in therapy?

Absolutely unreal.","Our culture as a whole has \*zero\* appreciation for the actual struggles of everyday life. Poor = lazy, rich = hard work. Nevermind all the CEOs that wouldn't last 5 minutes in an ""unskilled"" job.",1302,92,2021-01-13 15:40:23,kwiwdx
mentalhealth,My wife has passed suddenly,"I'm 24 and have two children with my wife we was expecting our third when she started cramping it was an ectopic pregnancy which ruptured and she didn't make it.

I wasn't aloud to go to hospital with her because of covid and was trying to come to terms with losing the pregnancy when I got a phone call to come to hospital and given the news I can not believe she's gone. My world has become so dark.

My daughter is five and is asking where her mummy is I can't begin to think what I'm going to say to her. 

My son is three and has development issues and is happily oblivious. 

I'm the stay at home dad my wife was the breadwinner I feel so guilty for worrying about money. Please someone help me I'm so scared of the future. 

 I love my wife iv never been with anyone else we met at 15 became parents at 19 and married at 21 iv never thought of my life going any other direction than us 4 all moving forwards together she's everywhere I look everybody I see looks at me like I'm an alien now I can't stand the look on people's faces when we go out my wife was very well known in my area from working at local corner shop and I haven't been able to avoid someone we know every single time iv left the house.","What a horrible tragedy and so close to a day celebrating love

I‚Äôm so sorry for your loss, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre an incredible parent and I know you‚Äôll take good care of your kids through this emotional time

It‚Äôs ok to be strong for them, it‚Äôs also ok to cry it out. The pain is a natural part in the cycle of suffering sudden death brings on. Every wave of grief and anger is normal to struggle with and some strange unusual emotions may get tossed in as well.

Now is the time to seek consolation and lean on your support systems, now is the time to enroll in therapy to help you heal so that you have the tools to help your children heal.

Of course finances are a big worry, even if she didn‚Äôt have a life insurance policy I‚Äôm sure your family can help stabilize things until the next best option becomes apparent.

I know we live in a world where money is king but prioritize your emotional health and that of your kids for right now, don‚Äôt let them see your fear of the future. It‚Äôs ok for them to know how grieved you are over how much you loved her but they need to feel stability in their home life even if that means moving around a bit.

The present feels like the worst possible thing that could ever happen has happened, you‚Äôll be the strongest you‚Äôve ever been emotionally after working through this. And even though it sounds crazy to even consider at this point you will find someone to share affection with who can help you coparent again.

The love and memories that you shared with her are eternal and can‚Äôt ever be disrupted just because your story with her was cut short. You will always have the early chapters to reread and there will be new chapters to write even if that answer isn‚Äôt satisfying because you want and miss that person.

Love is an infinite resource, take advantage of the other sources of love in your life and give it freely, as frightening as it may be you can never lose it. 

Everything will be ok even if it isn‚Äôt right now, reach out if you need to talk

Edit: I know you‚Äôre worried for money but your emotional, mental and spiritual health take precedence- if you need a free resource the crisis text line is equipped to help sort through wild emotions BEFORE they turn into a crisis point at 741741",1290,65,2021-02-15 13:04:11,lkd9pd
mentalhealth,"I survived a school shooting, but now I can‚Äôt do anything","I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve seen it on the news, Oxford High School got shot up by some selfish asshole. I was lucky enough to get into a classroom, but I could hear the gunshots and the screaming. I can‚Äôt seem to do anything anymore. I can‚Äôt sleep, can‚Äôt eat, don‚Äôt have the motivation to get out of bed, everything feels numb. I don‚Äôt know what to do. Why did I get to escape and live while 4 innocent people didn‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt really know what to do and what I expect to gain from posting here, but thank you.

Edit; I‚Äôm going to therapy, I will be picking up horse riding and starting art therapy. In an effort to solidify it I went to see Tate Myre during visitation today. He doesn‚Äôt look like he did while alive, but I was able to connect with a teacher and we will be hanging out and doing art things together. Thank you for your responses.

I also started playing a stupid little horse game called Howrse that I was obsessed with as a kid. Kinda makes it easier to feel like a kid again.","I'm an afghanistan vet. I tell you this because you are feeling the very same way I felt when I came home. So if its ok, I'd like to offer you my advice on trauma. 

You need to know that your experience was terrifying. Earth-shattering. World-rocking and security-robbing and you're now asking yourself questions that nobody should have to ask themselves, ever. I want you to know that nothing that happened is your fault. You aren't to blame.  You're not a bad person for surviving. You don't have a thing to feel guilty for in all of this, so try not to. I know it's hard. Think of guilt like a heavy weight. This weight is not yours to carry. Try not to carry it too long.

Right now, how you feel is raw and new, like a broken bone. Only so much worse. But, just like a broken bone, it'll slowly start to hurt less, day after day.  What you're feeling right now I think is a healthy and normal reaction. I know it doesn't feel like it, but you're going to be ok. Maybe not today. Maybe not tomorrow. But someday.

Give yourself time to heal. You don't have to feel normal until you're ready, so don't try to rush back to how things were. It's going to take time. I suggest talking. Surround yourself with family and friends. Talk out how you feel with people you love and trust and who love and trust you back. If you aren't ready or up to do that, writing letters helps me sometimes.

When you start feeling a little better (not before, don't rush it!) I'd say start picking up things that you like first. Do you like art? Paint yourself a little something thats for your eyes only. Nobody else ever has to see it if you don't want. Music, same thing. The idea is, when you're ready, give yourself a way to express how you feel.

It's going to be ok. You aren't to blame. Take it slow, and one day at a time. Sending all the support and care your way. Hang in there. Oh, and therapy helps! It really does!",1286,63,2021-12-03 17:33:18,r84f46
mentalhealth,"Does anyone else feel super motivated and ambitious late at night or around bedtime, and then waking up with absolutely none of those feelings?","I can't count how many 3AM's I've had where I thought ""Tomorrow, I'm gonna start doing this."" or had some big epiphany that gives me a ton of courage to make a positive change and then I just don't feel those feelings the next morning. It's been the case for years and years now. I know exactly what I want to do and how happy those changes would make me, but as soon as I wake up I just go back to wishing and fantasizing about them, feeling like there's a brick wall between me and taking that first step. It's so aggravating never being able to keep my own word, and it's quite psychologically damaging.","I know exactly what you mean, in bed you can avoid distractions and just think about what‚Äôs important, the motivation that you feel likely is what the right thing to do. You dropping it is likely due to distractions of what is effecting you to stop doing what you‚Äôre motivated to do. Let‚Äôs say for example (this is the one that applied to me and may not be the same for you, I‚Äôm going to mention it anyway though) you are addicted to a video game or a social media platform when you want to study. When your in bed, you don‚Äôt have to energy to go on social media or play on the game so you just think and you realise what you need to do. What I believe the best thing to do is (it may not be the best, I‚Äôm not a phycologist) is to literally do at least something close to what you want to achieve that night that will effect you the next day or take away the distraction. For me, that was deleting social media off my phone as well as all the games I had. The next day I started getting upset and stayed in my room (probably withdrawal symptoms) but because I already deleted my games, I didn‚Äôt need to worry about doing anything extreme and the day after I was able to study again. This obviously isn‚Äôt the same as something like alcoholism but I feel it could apply to anything. Getting rid of what‚Äôs holding you back (at least temporarily) will help push you towards what you want to achieve. The next 3 am you get I think you should do this (although it may not be the same for certain situations, respond if there‚Äôs a problem). You can guarantee you will be happier in the long run",1180,57,2021-02-09 09:24:24,lfysvh

I went to the dentist today for the first time in years. Because I spent so long not being able to brush my teeth I have to have 5 teeth pulled. I have an infection in my mouth and I can't chew on my left side without extreme pain in my mouth. I don't know if I'm going to have the money to fix it. 

Even if you don't change your clothes, or shower, or wash your face. Please brush your teeth. Clothes can be washed. Your body can be cleaned. Your face will be okay for another day. 

Your teeth will take thousands to fix, and will cause you extreme pain. Do it for future you. Do it so that you don't have to keep from eating for days just because it hurts so much. Do it so that you can keep eating the crunchy foods that you love without fear of breaking another tooth. 

Do it for when you're better. Do it for yourself. Because I don't want anyone to deal with what I'm having to deal with now. 

You can do it! I believe in you.","I‚Äôve seen a different post mention it but figured I‚Äôd mention it here.

Neither of those things are going to make me happy, and I suspect the same might be true for you. The statistics tell us that people arent happier when they earn more than they need.

mentalhealth,CW: Suicide. I almost took my life. Twice. Therapy saved me. But my therapist didn‚Äôt. Here‚Äôs what I mean.,"TL;DR please seek help if you are struggling, if you‚Äôre unhappy, or even if you‚Äôre happy and want to stay that way. There is a light. 

3 years ago, my family home was foreclosed on. 2 years ago my mom had a stroke and was paralyzed and left unable to speak. 3 months ago she passed away after a long battle. I haven‚Äôt been able to speak to my best friend for 2 years and now I‚Äôll never be able to. 

Within that time, I had two suicide attempts. I was on pills. I was drinking alone everyday. I was hospitalized. I was uninsured. I was homeless. I thought I was beyond repair. 

For two years now since then, I‚Äôve been in therapy. Every week for two years. 

Now, I‚Äôm engaged. An awesome step son. I have a good job. A nice place to live. I‚Äôm excited for the future. 

Therapy saved me. But not my therapist. 

My therapist is amazing. He‚Äôs smart. Insightful. Knows when to listen. But when I started therapy, I thought my therapist would just tell me what to do. I‚Äôd do it. And I‚Äôd be fixed. 

That‚Äôs not how it worked for me. 

A lot of my friends who aren‚Äôt in therapy have been afraid to, or too stubborn to go seek help. 

They think they know better than a professional. BUT HERES THE RUB: My therapist didn‚Äôt know how to fix me. 

I did. 

(For me personally) therapy has been about bringing out repressed thoughts and feelings. Things I couldn‚Äôt talk to my friends about. Couldn‚Äôt talk about with my family.

Therapy also made me take accountability. For all my mistakes, the people I‚Äôve wronged.

I can now accept my past and look to the future. A future I wanted to take away from myself.

mentalhealth,Does anyone else just desperately want someone to talk too but also hate the thought of interacting with someone?,"I have very few friends and none of them are close to me, so I never talk to them about anything that's going on in my life. 
Sometimes I find myself desperately wanting a friend or just someone I could talk to and tell them about my day.  
Whenever I start talking to someone it normally starts of good but then I find myself regretting making friends with them. I start dreading the moments when they message me. And it's not because of them, not at all. This is just something that's always happened to me. Socializing just, it makes me exhausted I guess. 

Sometimes it's an absolute hell too because I just want someone to talk too but I can't bring myself to actually message them. 

Does anyone else have this happen to them?","Wow I relate 100%. I used to be so eager to make fiends but then I would be anxious about the ‚Äúresponsibilities‚Äù and having to actually hang out, so I ended up losing them all. Right now I have no one and I really regret it. But also depression makes socializing truly exhausting, as do many mental illnesses. It‚Äôs so isolating to be struggling with mental health and interacting with others when you feel terrible is like a performance, and that takes a lot of energy.

I love my friends and they are supportive of my situation and I also knew what I felt wasn't true. Regardless of that I had to leave, lay in my bed for awhile and then go to sleep.

I hate the fact that my mental health stood in the way of celebrating the end of my undergraduate career.  I wish I could've been normal and not have to feel the way I feel.

mentalhealth,Is depression actually just a heightened awareness of the pointlessness of life?,"Something that often comes to mind.

It's common for a lot of people suffering with depression to feel that life is pointless and a waste of time. When I think about it, the only logical purpose to our existence is to procreate; which arguably could be seen as pointless, as it's ultimately unfulfillable. This train of thought always leads me to the same answer; which is that my depression isn't caused by some sort of chemical imbalance, or poor circumstances, but the understanding that my life is in fact pointless.

Is this shared, and if so, how do you overcome (or bypass) these thoughts to allow a productive life?","In my opinion, depression is more of an *overemphasis* on the pointlessness of life. Now that I am on medication, I am able to feel some degree of motivation to move on with my day, in spite of the fact that I still believe that life is intrinsically pointless. I am also better able to enjoy things and find personal meaning in them because my brain's chemical imbalance isn't weighing me down so much.

Depression would bog me down and force me to fixate on the pointless of life, whereas with medication I am able to consider it, but then shrug and say ""so what?"" because I now actually want to do things anyway.",568,63,2021-05-11 14:01:42,n9xoog

mentalhealth,We need to stop calling suicide an ‚Äúimpulsive decision‚Äù,"Suicide is so much more than just a ‚Äúspur of the moment‚Äù. When a person has been struggling for months, weeks, or years, it‚Äôs not impulsive. When a person has a successful and thought through plan, it‚Äôs not impulsive. When a person has reached out multiple times, but they aren‚Äôt heard, it‚Äôs not impulsive. When a person feels like nothing will ever get better, and death is their best option, it is not impulsive. They have carefully picked out each pro and con and thought of nothing but their death for a very long time. It is not impulsive. Suicide is not impulsive because others cannot see their struggle. Outside sources cannot label suicide as ‚Äúimpulsive‚Äù when they do not know the severity and dexterity of the persons situation.

^^ In this post I‚Äôm talking about every situation being called impulsive, because there very much is situations where it is impulsive, which is not to say that it‚Äôs any harder or easier, it‚Äôs just different, and a lot of times non impulsive behaviors or situations are labeled as impulsive, and having been on both sides it can be very frustrating. I‚Äôm talking about phrases like ‚Äúa permanent solution for a temporary problem‚Äù or being called selfish, because suicide is very different to how it is labeled. For some it is impulsive, and for some it isn‚Äôt.","At the hospital when they send someone to ask you questions. They ask if it was a impulsive decision or if it was planned. It‚Äôs been two times for both. I used to get a really bad day and that on top of my major depression and suicidal thoughts and urges. Would make Me just snap like within a hour at home of sitting on my bed I would go from ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not gonna do that‚Äù to ‚Äúf*ck it‚Äù. 

 So sometimes it is impulsive. That‚Äôs why mental health professionals usually ask. But we can‚Äôt expect people without mental illness or suicidal thoughts to understand that sometimes it isn‚Äôt. Because they aren‚Äôt ever gonna fully understand. But I understand how annoying it is when they don‚Äôt understand.

I had a mental health professional tell me I was selfish because there are people out there that have it worse than me. And another say I just wanted attention. So sometimes even mental health professionals really don‚Äôt understand also.",557,34,2021-04-14 05:48:48,mqk9c0

As someone who suffers from mental health problems this doesn't help. It just feels like a dig.

When you point this out, I already know. I know I'm being irrational, I know I'm being negative, but I don't know how to be rational or positive. I need help. 

I need you to tell me what the rational or positive thought is, I need to be made aware of the exact actions I could take or thoughts I could have to help me stop feeling this way and I guarantee other people do to.

mentalhealth,Two weeks ago I was almost homeless. Now I got a job and a place to stay and my mental health seems to be improving a lot,"I think is important to share some positive news as well since sometimes we just come here in our lowest times, and I shared here previously when I thought I was at one of the direst moments of my life.

It has been two weeks, I was basically out of money in a new city, have searched everywhere for a job but couldn't find any, so I decided to go to the social services center at the town hall to see if they could help me anyway. Shared with the staff my story and how I was going to be homeless that same day, but since it is a small city, the social worker contacted a friend of hers that owned a place that was looking for a woman to cook, clean and receive guests at a private tourist attraction.  

Although I'm male, she decided to give me a chance, and so it has been two weeks of hard work but everything is working out so far. I actually like the job a lot, and my employer seems to be quite happy with my performance and already increased my salary from past week. 

My anxiety and depression are way under control now. It seems that since my work requires more doing and less thinking it just keeps my mind better focused in the job and been glad for this opportunity that while I still get some intrusive thoughts once in a while, they are way less aggressive than they were in the past few months/years.

So that is it. Just sharing a story with a better ending than I expected so that, maybe, it give those of you guys who are still facing harder times, a glimmer of hope that things may get better for you too. Is a bit cheesy, but in the end, hope is sometimes all that we have left, and guts to keep on fighting wherever way you can.",YAY!!!!!!!! :),532,21,2021-04-19 00:15:28,mtoyxw

mentalhealth,"Just because it is (sadly) normal for ppl to experience suicidal thoughts especially at the moment, suicidal thoughts themselves are not normal PLZ STOP NORMALIZING SUICIDAL THOUGHTS","sorry for the caps lock but it really concerns me. I'm not saying this without any context its something ive heard ppl say before. ""Well everyone has dark thoughts and most ppl are just able to deal with them"" Sorry if it sounds a bit melodramatic but would you say to someone with cancer symptoms ""Well lots of people experience symptoms that might be caused by cancer and they just dealt with them by themselves"" no u wouldn't so plz dont do it for mental health either","I‚Äôll throw in my two cents as a therapist. Suicidal thoughts occur on a spectrum. On one end, are thoughts like, ‚ÄúI hope I die on the way to work because I can‚Äôt take one more criticism from my stupid boss,‚Äù and ‚Äú life would be so much easier if I was dead.‚Äù On the other end of the spectrum, we have thoughts AND actions. Thoughts like, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do this anymore. Every breath is unbearable,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to write letters to people I love, give my little brother some of my things, steal my dad‚Äôs gun, and I‚Äôm ending this tomorrow.‚Äù 

So yes, everyone (or most people) have had dark thoughts but I‚Äôm sorry people have told you to get over it. I hate the thought process of, ‚ÄúThis happens to everyone so it can‚Äôt be that bad for you.‚Äù It‚Äôs so unhelpful and untrue. Just because a child in Africa hasn‚Äôt eaten in 3 days doesn‚Äôt mean I can‚Äôt feel hungry and certainly doesn‚Äôt mean I should also starve. 

I don‚Äôt know who these people are in your life that are saying these things to you but I‚Äôm glad you know they‚Äôre wrong. If your suicidal thoughts are intrusive and are concerning you, please reach out to someone. Either an online chat, a therapist, a friend who won‚Äôt just tell you to deal with it, etc. And thank you for posting this because you‚Äôre completely right and I think more people need to understand.",529,22,2021-02-19 10:42:15,lncyc8
mentalhealth,I planned to kill myself today but I didn‚Äôt.,"EDIT: I am overwhelmed by the support I have been provided today. After coming home from work all I did was lay down today and dick around on the internet and for this to be part of my general tomfoolery I use to distract myself, I am grateful. I don‚Äôt really know how to reply to everyone. I‚Äôve largely snapped out of it but I am still frazzled and having a lot of trouble getting back to sleep (it‚Äôs 3AM as I type this). I don‚Äôt have weapons or drugs that could easily kill me, I am not alone, so I will be okay. I‚Äôll try to focus on spending time with myself tomorrow and do something to make myself feel better. Thank you again for the support. 


I woke up this morning with an unshakable feeling that today would be the day I finally commit suicide. I figured I could throw myself in front of a train. I said goodbye to my boyfriend and told him I love him. 
I ended up not doing that because I had professional obligations and made promises. By the time it was over, my colleague offered to drive me home so I wouldn‚Äôt take the train. So, I got home safe and was able to snap out of it. 
It feels like a bad dream and now I just want to lay down and go to sleep. 
I‚Äôve been feeling horribly inferior to everyone around me. I‚Äôm not intelligent, I don‚Äôt have any special skills, and I really believe nothing will be lost if I died. I feel as if I should just accept my inherent worthlessness and just save everyone the trouble of me breathing their air. 

I don‚Äôt want to reach out to people who know me because I don‚Äôt want to worry them. And I certainly don‚Äôt want them thinking I‚Äôm just looking for attention or validation. 
My therapist is also not being super helpful. I am not sure I‚Äôve made much progress. 

What should I do if it happens again? I don‚Äôt want to burden everyone else.","If it happens again, you would probably be best off staying home provided you aren‚Äôt home alone, you could see if your boyfriend could take the da off and just wait it out at home with him to watch you in case you try to do something harmful",530,47,2021-09-15 13:39:50,poqbpn

mentalhealth,"How I became a happier and kinder person, and accidently started liking myself a lot more","I did a random experiment on myself a few years ago. I did not read about this anywhere, I just thought of it and decided to try it.


I forced myself to think nice thoughts about every stranger I see. When I see someone on the street, I think of something nice about that person. Like ""their hair look so good"", ""what a nice smile"", ""those legs are great"" etc. In the beginning it was hard. Like, the first thought that popped up was something mean, but then I followed it up to find something good about the person.


If I don't find anything nice to think about their appearances (it happens), I don't force it, instead I make a nice assumption about them. I think ""she probably has a great sense of humour"", ""he is probably a great dad"", ""this person could be very creative"" etc. Just whatever pops up, and the great part is, it doesn't matter if it's true or not. I just form a nice assumption in my mind. 


In the beginning I had to consciously make the decision to think something nice. After a while it started automatically happen. It's been years, but now every time I go out I think mostly kind thoughts about people. This lead me to think more nice thoughts about myself. When I see myself in a mirror, I'm no longer trained to search for flaws, I automatically think nice things about myself aswell. I'm a much more confident person due to this.


If you want to try this, I recommend starting with strangers. When that becomes natural, apply it to everyone. Your classmates, your colleagues, your friends. Force yourself to focus on the positives. If you think something negative of someone, thats perfectly okay, but follow it up with something nice. Now I have an easier time giving people spontaneous and genuine compliments, because that's how my mind works. I'm a lot happier and calmer around people when I think kind thoughts about everyone. And this is not something that happened naturally, I had to train myself to do this, and it worked!

I want to add, that I've had some friends that were the opposite. The kind that thinks it's fun to roast everyone they see and say mean things about strangers or acquaintances. I talked to them about this, talked to them about how I'm changing my mindset and asked them to not behave like this around me. Some changed, some I am no longer friends with. Not a big loss, in hindsight. People that act like that was a negative influence in my life anyway. 


If you try this, good luck, and please let me know how it goes for you :) It will probably feel super weird and silly in the beginning, but try to stick with it for a while and see what happens to your thought patterns!","Neuroplasticity! You essentially rewired your brain for positivity. Gratitude journaling (writing things you are grateful for every day) is often recommended for this same reason. 

Great job and great results. I totally believe in this, I just always forget to do it. Alternatively, I've been burnt-out and stressed out lately and I actually feel and notice my negative pathways/tendencies get stronger. 

It's crazy we have this brain that does stuff, but we also forget that we can also *make* it do stuff too.

mentalhealth,"Has anyone else lost ""friends"" that made it seem like your mental illness was a bigger inconvenience for them than it was for you?","I use the word ""friends"" loosely, because they no longer hold that title.

I went through a pretty rough phase of about six months. My depression and anxiety were at an all-time high. I won't go into all the details, but I just needed someone to be there for me.

I was told, by two friends of 10+ years, that my depression was ""too much,"" and that they ""couldn't handle it."" They told me that I needed to ""own up to my actions"" (being depressed, I guess???). Then, they just deleted me from everything and stopped talking to me. Some friends, eh?

Still makes me sick to this day. But perhaps, it's better to be rid of those people.

Don't get me wrong, I know it can be difficult when your friends don't have their shit together. But isn't that what friends are for? To support you and be there for you when you're in a dark place?

I can't even imagine doing what they did. But maybe that's just me.

I guess I'm just wondering if anyone has experienced this as well. Please feel free to share your stories. Would be nice to know I'm not completely alone.",Yeah I‚Äôve been there too. The ones I lost were big on toxic positivity and fully believed that there was something wrong with me because I have depression and anxiety.

mentalhealth,Recovering from depression really feels like I‚Äôm trying to stay ‚Äúsober‚Äù,"First I‚Äôve never had to deal with substance abuse, and if what I saying is insensitive please let me know.
 
It really does feel like what I imagine abstaining from alcohol or drugs feels like, but instead of that, your abstaining from bad choices. For example, can‚Äôt stay out with friends because if I don‚Äôt have a regular sleep routine, it will drastically effect my mood. Can‚Äôt drink a lot of caffeine because it will effect my sleep schedule and my mood. Can‚Äôt drink alcohol because with messes with my medication and my mood. Can‚Äôt think those negative thoughts or otherwise I will spiral. Can‚Äôt stay in bed all morning, or otherwise you‚Äôll stay in bed all day or even several days. I have to perform basic hygiene even though it is really hard today, or else you‚Äôll feel ten times worse.

Was wondering if anyone else felt like this?

Edit: oh wow! I did not expect this to get any comments or votes. I have suffered depression for over a decade, staring in my teen years. I did not get the help that I needed until recently, and therefore developed many bad habits to try and cope with it. But for the past few months I‚Äôve been working on getting better, but then I spiraled really bad during the holidays because I strayed from my rigid routine. So now I‚Äôm trying to start all over again. But it really helps to know that other people feel this way too. Thanks for the awards and comments!","I know how you feel exactly, I don‚Äôt even have a solution but I get what you‚Äôre saying. It‚Äôs hard sometimes and I really have to monitor myself to make sure I don‚Äôt start spiraling out of no where.

mentalhealth,"Just spent 15 minutes being berated by a doctor for being on antidepressants, because ""they're not good for your brain""","Context: I've been on antidepressants for around 8 months, made an appointment today as I was almost out. When I got to my appointment, the doctor spent 15 minutes having a go at me for being on antidepressants because I'm apparently not supposed to be on them for more than 6 months (?) and ""they're not good for my brain"", she said, ranting and waving her arms at me. I am also hard of hearing, and after struggling to understand her (through a mask) several times, she raised her voice and started talking to me like I was a complete idiot. When she was done, she reluctantly handed over my prescription and I left the room almost in tears.

I've just moved country from an abusive household and as a result became estranged from my whole family. I have anxiety attacks almost every day, struggle with insomnia, and I'm having severe depressive episodes on top of being extremely overwhelmed. My mental health is very unstable right now.

My partner was there with me and witnessed the whole thing, and he wrote a complaint. But it doesn't really matter, because the damage is done. I feel miserable and ashamed and now dreading having to refill my prescription when this one runs out.

I guess I just wanted to share here. I've been feeling really low these past few days, and today just kind of topped it all off. Thank you for taking the time to read. üíô",Some doctors can be the worst people. I‚Äôm so sorry that happened.

mentalhealth,Did your parent ever say ‚Äústop crying before i give you something to cry about‚Äù?,"EDIT : i should say children under 6 or 7 !! 

So many parents (mine included) said this to me as a child. I think it‚Äôs so harmful to children because they are tiny humans with emotions that they don‚Äôt understand how to control, and my personal opinion is that it is a parent‚Äôs responsibility to teach their child how to navigate negative emotions. Does anyone feel this way as well? Lets talk about it üòä","Yeah, I never understood that concept to be honest. My parents never went on with the threat part, but they did tell me to stop crying now and then, and I just couldn't understand that. I answered ""Alright, let me press my 'stop crying button' then"" once (which, obviously, didn't end well :P), and I feel like that sums it up well; what the hell is the child supposed to do?

Crying is the last resort of someone overwhelmed with emotion. When they reach a stage where they lose every bit of control over their feelings. How the hell are they supposed to ""stop"" that? It's like asking a barrelling car to stop barrelling and drive straight, or an overflowing pot of milk to settle down...

But to come back to the effect on a child, yeah, I totally agree that it's part of a parent's role (and responsibility) to teach their child how to understand and, then, handle their emotions. And telling them ""aye can you repress all of that please, your sounds are annoying"" is probably the absolute way to do that. :/",496,65,2021-03-17 17:31:39,m75qwm
mentalhealth,"I like to think, whenever you ""pour one out"" for a friend or family member who has passed, in whatever afterlife you picture them in, a cup appears in front of them and they get to drink whatever you poured out for them.","I'll start by saying, I'm agnostic. And I dont really believe in absolutes. Because no one can see the future. No one really knows whats happening in someone else's head. And you can't predict who will pull through whatever, or who will be lost to whatever. And there's no way to really know what happens when we die. 

In all honesty, that thought brings me comfort. I dont think im a bad person. Sure, ive done shitty things, im human, like you (I assume). But this mindset is what has gotten me through some rough shit. 

2019 Is my worst year to date. August 24, a good friend who I really looked up to, committed suicide. I credit him to be a big part in preventing my own suicide. Then in November a great uncle and a high school classmate, both i was very fond of, passed within a couple days of each other. Then December 10, my grandma passed after a stroke the week prior. Her husband, my grandpa passed in May 2020. 

That was a bad time, as you can imagine. I had never lost anyone I was ever close to before then. My friends suicide being the big thing im still struggling with today. But whenever I have a beer, or some liquor, I pour one out in his/their name. 

I like to imagine my friend in Valhalla. As of all the afterlives that I know of, thats where he belongs. As he is a fucking legend. He lost his battle with depression, but he fought fucking hard. I still laugh and smile at the thought of him in any afterlife yelling at whoever is in charge because they don't understand the rules of whatever afterlife Pathfinder game he's running. 

And I like to think that wherever he, my grandparents, my old high school buddy, and my great uncle may be. When I pour one out, a beautiful mug full of that liquid is presented to them. 

Which that thought is made better by the fact that often times, im drinking really shitty cheap booze. And they look up from wherever they are and are just kinda ""what the fuck? You pour one out in mourning and im stuck with your shitty 1 dollar beer?"" 

I dont know, just a thought that may help someone in mourning. Hang in there, stranger. No matter how shitty life gets, it will always get better.  And despite the fact that life will get shitty again at some point, it WILL get better again. 

Hang in there.","That's beautiful, man. Never really thought it about that way. I just might adopt that way of thinking.",490,18,2021-01-11 05:02:03,kuvptu
mentalhealth,New job! Still homeless but I got a new job! Mental health is on the uptick!,"I am so fucking excited.   


Story time.   


Before Covid hit I was a leasing agent for a large Canadian REIT.  I was important, I was valued, I was paid very well. I had everything I wanted. I was fortunate enough to be sent to Calgary to launch one of the largest private student housing projects in Canadian history. Was a big big deal in the industry. Then Covid came along and decimated the Student housing industry. 50% of our clients were international and of the remaining 50% being domestic, only a small fraction of those were 'locally domestic' You can imagine what losing 90% of your paying clients can do for a project.  


I lost my job and came home defeated. My mental health suffered. My physical health suffered. My relationship suffered. I wasn't working, I wasn't a partner anymore. My girl left me in Dec.   


Things were hard. I was alone, I'm very much an introvert. The only people I talk to are people via Reddit or random women on dating apps. There's nobody I could call to come over and hang out with. Nobody I could call if I was having a dark moment. And there were many dark moments let me tell you.   


Winter blues is a thing. I'm a huge believer in that. I was living in a basement apartment that my ex and I shared before she left. I was so immobile emotionally and physically that for 5 months after she left I couldn't bring myself to removing anything she left behind. She took the cats, but the cat food sat in its dish for months. Her clothes still hung in the closet the way she left them. Every day was a dark dank lonely sad existence. I knew I needed a change. I had to change my outlook, my direction, my goals.   


I started talking to people on dating apps. I had no intention of seeing anyone. I just needed to talk to people again. That helped. I also started being more active on Reddit, that helped too. I like talking with people, I like giving advice. Small uptick in mental health after this.   
Then the sun started coming out. The grey dirty snow started going away. It was the end of April. Forced myself to go outside, even for a minute. Even for that very short walk to get milk. Instead of ordering it I went and got it. Small uptick in mental health after this.   
I got closure with my ex. Finally. Small uptick here.   


I needed something drastic though.   


So, voluntary homelessness. I left my apartment. I rented a room, and when that went to shit I started living out of my car. Waking up in the bush, next to a river, down by the ocean did wonders. Not caring or worrying about anything. Nothing at all, just being entirely selfish in my needs, my mental health. Huge uptick. I started smiling again. I started feeling better about everything. 

&#x200B;

Was going to spend the entire summer living outta my car. Then one random night I applied for a building manager job. Its become so much more than that.   


I was just given a job offer for a leasing agent role AND a building manager role. For a smaller REIT, but this position will require me to be very mobile. I could be driving 3hrs away to one of our buildings. I will never sit in an office. The company car is my office.   


Its going to be a couple weeks before I can afford an apartment, or I might just continue to live out of my car. Which may be tough because I'll also have a company car. So we'll see what happens there.   


But huge huge uptick. Motivation is high. Excitement is high. Self worth is high. I'm valued again. They were hugely impressed with my skill set, and its feels so damn good to be valued again.   


I wanted to share this because I've said to 100s of people on this very same sub that things can change, but you need to be the catalyst for that change. Nobody is going to come along and place change at your feet. You are responsible for everything that happens in your life, regardless of what has happened in your life. Wake up tomorrow, forge forward, make a small change in your life and allow it to snowball.   


Things are on an uptick now, but things dont get any easier. With this uptick comes a tremendous amount of responsibility. People are invested in me. This motivates me. I'll wake up tomorrow for my first day with a tremendous amount of energy and enthusiasm but will have to know and understand that a downtick can come at anytime. I'll deal with those when they come, I'm not going to worry about something that hasn't happened yet.   


Forward progress. Be the catalyst for change and personal growth. Have your pity party. Be sad. Have regret. But you gotta get over it, you gotta find closure and move on because the world will continue to spin without you. May aswell spin with it amirite?","Thanks for that story.  
Makes me belive that if I just keep trying, eventually... I'll catch a break

Lost my job do to Covid aswell, Tried for a Tech Support position for 8 months... and then last week, 3 weeks before my birthday, well... everthing went south.  
Been sending appications everywhere every day since that day, close to 40.  
But that does not chance the fact that I've been unemployed for... a year I guess.

mentalhealth,I dont want to kill myself but I don't want to be alive either. It feels like I'm being forced to suffer and the only things that make me happy are just distractions from getting better.,"I fucking hate myself and everyone around me. I hate my mother, my dad and my brother. I hate my best friend. I hate my fucked up body and being alive is just morbid and disgusting. My mum is refusing to take proper care of my pets which I now have 5 of because she wanted more and will probably try to get more. I do the best I can but she still fucking overfeeds them so my two new kittens are going to be overweight and sick like the rest of my animals. 

If I show any sign of disagreement which is basically fucking impossible because she will literally say ""look how fat theyre getting isnt it cute"" and I cant help but look miserable or telling her that what shes doing is wrong. She will threaten to kick me out to move in with my dad which she has done multiple times before. I cant stay there because the whole house is covered in mould and I have breathing issues because Ive been smoking cigarettes, weed, heroin, pills, suboxone and tons of other crap since I was 12 years old. My breathing is so fucked I am constantly aware of my lungs and just breathing fresh air makes me feel so disgusted to be alive. I have an infection in my mouth and another in my sinus, which I basically have permanently because of the fucked up structure of my face.

Im not taking drugs anymore but I still smoke a cigarette every few days and I am so guilty because no matter how hard I seem to try, I cant even take care of myself. 

I live in fucking sydney where the house and rent prices are so fucked even if could find a trade or work I wouldnt be able to move out. The only person I had that understood and was there with me through all this shit was raped and murdered almost two years. He was my best fucking friend, the only person my age that I had been friends with in 6 years. My other best and only friend is addicted to fucking heroin and has aspergers so he just jumps to conclusions and gets mad at me if I show him any sort of emotion about things that are going on in my life, he just thinks im weak. I stopped seeing him because hes a horrible fucking influence. but I end up visiting him every week because i want social contact, but I just end up regretting it and leaving his house after an hour.

Ive recently been diagnosed with fucking epilepsy so thats fun. I have seizures when I dont get enough sleep, and I cant because my mum is fucking yelling or if im at my dads house he is up all night singing and working. Literally all night he sleeps from 6 am to 4 pm. So im constantly worried about having a siezure and I try so hard to get good sleep. So recently my sleeps been good enough that I dont think im at seizure risk, but still bad enough that my health is on a strong and steady decline. 

My brother doesnt talk to me, hes becoming an alcoholic. I mean hes been drinking everyday for the past year, but atleast hes stopped stealing off me and doesnt threaten to beat me up everytime I make eye contact with him anymore. 

I really dont want to kill myself but I have felt so bad my whole life and I cant seem to turn it around that I think if it keeps going it will be the only reasonable option. This is fucking bullshit. Why the fuck are the people around my happy. They are all fucking kidding themselves and need to just accept the fact there lives fucking suck so maybe they might actually do something to help themselves and inturn the people that care about them.

I hate everyone I care about and it makes me so fucking angry.

mentalhealth,I found a suicide note my bf wrote last night and I don‚Äôt know what to do,"I‚Äôve been worried about my bf. We‚Äôve been together for almost 11 years now. I monitor his search history because he doesn‚Äôt share his true feelings so this is how I know what he‚Äôs feeling. I went through his searches this morning and noticed him searching last night for ‚Äúpainless and effective methods of suicide‚Äù among other things. I went through his phone and found a suicide message written in it. 

I‚Äôve found them before but always months after the fact. The last time he wrote something it was an update saying he was still standing and things were looking up. But this time it was a goodbye note. And that everything he thought was looking up was just a delusion. 

He was sleeping when I left for work today. I don‚Äôt know what to do. He wrote the note right before he went to bed. If I admit I looked he‚Äôll be even more secretive in the future and then I just won‚Äôt know it‚Äôs happening (he‚Äôs so good at hiding it, the only way I know is by looking at his search history and he can easily make it incognito in the future if he‚Äôs aware). 

I‚Äôve tried getting him to go to therapy and he doesn‚Äôt want to. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do. 

I took pictures of the note but I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm allowed to share it. 

Please don‚Äôt comment on me looking at his searches. I‚Äôm doing what I can to keep my loved one safe.","Wow that's a tough position for you both I'm really sorry. Do you aks him about his feelings often? As a guy we are told to share our emotions but when we do most people don't give a fuck so you have to make sure your honest and show you want to hear these things tell him you won't judge him he's safe and his emotions matter. There was a study that showed that just straight up asking someone ""are you thinking about killing yourself?"" was one of the best questions to ask I guess because it shows true intent instead of the inconsistent ""are you okay?"",as for starting the conversation maybe just ask how he's been feeling how has life/work been? Then just slowly ask about his mental health tell him your worried if you are I don't think you have to out right say to him you seen the things you have seen because as you said that could make things worse. And you could also try calling a suicide prevention hotine and explaining the situation or even contact a therapist or counseller and have a phone consultation and explain its in behalf of your bf and you want to know how to best support him.
It's super difficult position to be in but the fact you care is amazing alot of people pretend to care and if your honest with your intentions to help he will see that... At some point. Good luck ü§û",495,42,2021-04-05 16:16:58,mkoer7

mentalhealth,Does anyone else feel like they are fundamentally broken and never had a chance at being happy?,"I feel like god or fate or the universe or whatever, created me already broken. Like there are people who are created to thrive and be happy and enjoy life, and there are people created broken who never have a fighting chance at thriving or being happy. I don't think there ever was or ever will be a chance that I could be happy. I think I was created without that ability and nothing I do can ever change that. I don't want to die, but I hate this life. I always imagine and fantasize about the life I want and it's literally impossible for it to ever come true. Literally everything about the world would have to change, and even then would it be like I imagine? Because part of my fantasy is that I'm happy and no matter what happens I don't think I could ever feel that way. And after how long of fantasizing about a life that I could never have and emotions I could never feel, at what point do I just accept that this reality will never be anywhere near what I want to experience, do I just have to accept it and give up? At what point do I just have to say that living will never be enjoyable and just end it all? I don't want to appear negative or down but at this point it feels like a fact. It's a fact I'm broken and it's a fact I can never be happy and it's a fact that that's how I was created and that's how I'll always be.","My therapist is a former Buddhist monk. I said something akin to this worry and he said:

>western aesthetic convinces you that happiness is a destination goal. 'If I just had this I'd be happy', 'after I do that, then I can start my life'. But the goal always moves when you get to that point. We go to school..after I finish school I can do whatever I want..but when you finish senior year, you get to the next stage and you're not happy either.

>Eastern cultures frame happiness as a homeostasis.

mentalhealth,The power of walking,"  

..I saw somewhere on reddit, an advice on going for walks when feeling down.

After a breakup in late January, being a couch potato in the beginning, where I have been feeling like my lowest ever. Feeling sad, depressed, lonely and hurt like hell. While at the same time, going nuts from working from home, and not seeing anyone. Fuck this pandemic, right??! 

I decided, 13-14th Feb-ish to just go for a short walk, every day. Because‚Ä¶ fuck it what else is there to do.

I usually walked 20-30 minutes each day at first. Then the last 4-5 days I walked around hour. First it was just a nice break from being stuck indoor. But I have started feeling happier ever since I started walking. I don‚Äôt feel like giving up on life as much as I did not long ago. I even feel like smiling to strangers on my walk now... Yeah, I‚Äôm weird like that.

But today I walked 13km!! (8Miles, I think) my feet hurt, but I feel amazing, and kind of proud I did it. Also, I really need to get some wireless headphones‚Ä¶ wanted to chew that wire to pieces several times today. I still feel lonely, and missing my ex. But one day at a time, I guess.

Seriously, go for a walk.",That's amazing! I'm so proud of you! Walking really does wonders and I think it's really awesome that you had the will power to do it!,472,34,2021-02-25 16:30:26,lsahwz
mentalhealth,Tonight we sat and cried together. I forgot I had the power to help people even when I‚Äôm sad. Words aren‚Äôt always necessary.,"In my family we don‚Äôt talk much.

Tonight was a rough night. As per usual I was sat alone in my crying and melting into my mattress. When my mom came in I didn‚Äôt bother looking up at her and just growled a classic‚Äô go away‚Äô in response. 

She asked to borrow one of my books and I peeled myself off my bed to grab it. It was only when I went to tell her to leave did I actually bother to look at her. She looked like she had blown her noise a few times and her eyes were watery. This was maybe the second or third time in my entire life I‚Äôd seen this happen and I forgot how shellshocking it was to see your numbed parent like that. 

This lead to a short uncomfortable conversation of me asking if she was okay. We didn‚Äôt talk much. Instead I just asked her if she wanted to sit on the couch with me and watch a movie. I got her a blanket and some tissues. The whole movie we just sat there, at first crying and just holding hands by the end.

I still don‚Äôt know what happened to make her so sad. She knew better than to dig into my pile of mental issues. But when the movie was over she hugged me and said ‚Äúthank you. this is the happiest I‚Äôve been in a while. I needed this.‚Äù 

It really took me out of my own bullshit for a moment to realize I had done something good just by being there. And she had done the same for me in a way. I could tell we just both felt cared for by the end and in my house that goes a long way. 

Don‚Äôt forget how powerful small things are. Or that the people around you are often suffering too. You don‚Äôt need to be in perfect or even good shape to be the support someone needs. 


Also the movie was Hairspray if anyone was curious.","That was beautiful ‚ù§Ô∏è And you're so right, sometimes the smallest things help ü•∞",469,15,2021-02-07 10:45:16,lek8xh
mentalhealth,I'm sick of therapists using CBT where it isn't helpful,"I'm getting really sick of people who are all about Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Positive Psychology and think having a positive attitude is the end all be all of mental health treatment. There are many people who benefit from this type of therapy, don't get me wrong, but the people who are suffering most often see it as writing them off. If you are deep in poverty, in an abusive relationship, jobless, homeless, or preoccupied with messages from voices you hear, these methods do not work. Therapists need to take this into account when working with people who fit into these categories, but also initially with all patients. There should be an understanding that people aren't very open at first in therapy in general and could have any of these things going on and not tell you. Simply saying you need to change your thoughts doesn't work. People may be in situations where their thoughts are about real problems they need to face every day. I understand trying to make it easier for that person and that is what you think you're doing, but really you are just making your job easier. You, as a therapist, would be much better off starting with asking what kind of therapy someone is looking for and describing the different forms if necessary. Different forms fit different people and I'm sick of CBT being the gold standard. 

It really makes my blood boil when I hear someone say their therapist doesn't listen, and most of the time it's because they are trying to use CBT and Positive Psychology where they don't belong. Sometimes life really is hard for that person, and trying to get them to think differently about it is an exercise in futility. People are often quietly in crisis, and I see these approaches as inherently dismissive of this fact. 

I hope someone sees this and knows they can advocate to their therapist for something different, because I have had to multiple times and it is not easy.","I'm a therapist and I agree with everything you've said. I'm not a CBT therapist, I use the Humanistic/Person-Centred approach. CBT does have it's place but it's always seemed like a surface level therapy to me. It aims to change negative thought patterns, which is great, but it often doesn't delve into *why* someone has those negative thought patterns. The Person-Centred approach looks at things like conditions of worth, the self concept, the self actualising tendency, etc. Personally I feel that gives much deeper healing than simply changing someone's thinking. In my opinion it also helps for longer. CBT can give quick symptom reduction, but if you don't focus on the why then that won't last.",461,59,2021-06-10 12:44:56,nwmpz1

I quickly realized it‚Äôs what I‚Äôve fear, he went into full blown psychosis. I called all the closest people in his life and they came over and stayed so I wasn‚Äôt alone. He was okay with it and told me he needed help, to please help him. We started off going to a voluntary inpatient. He was in the waiting room and it was going well, until he broke. He threatened everyone there and stripped down naked. At that point they called some firefighters to take him to a regular hospital to make sure there were no drugs in his system. There weren‚Äôt. He was okay in the hospital as well, until he wasn‚Äôt. He got super angry and scared, which is understandable. But he threatened everyone there as well. I know that‚Äôs not my husband. But he continued to threaten me and told me he‚Äôs going to kill me and that he‚Äôs the devil. At that point I had to leave the room, I was legitimately scared for my life. Now we‚Äôre at the point where he might have to go to a court ordered treatment. I‚Äôm so so scared for him and wish I could take him home but there‚Äôs no way I can without getting really hurt or dying. I know treatment facilities aren‚Äôt great.

mentalhealth,Abuse [trigger warning],"My dad wanted to sleep with me.
He made me chat with adults on the internet. He pretended that I was his sister. He talked about threesomes with me and strangers. He justified it to himself. He got off to these fantasies, under a blanket, thinking I didn't notice.

He laid on the couch with me. He asked if I was too warm, and if I wanted to take off my clothes. I said no. He touched my stomach and told me I was soft. He told me I was beautiful, that I had a soft back. He asked if I wanted to take off me clothes. I said no. It felt like forever before he gave up.

mentalhealth,Why are people like this allowed to be psychiatrists?,"I went to a psychiatrist for the first time today. I had quite high hopes because he has an incredible reputation and lots of good reviews online. I was sent there by my psychologist because she couldn't quite figure out what was wrong with me.

I had prepared quite well for the appointment, I had brought a list of the maybe-diagnoses my psychologist had given me and the corresponding symptoms. (For context: she diagnosed a medium depression, depersonalisation- and derealization syndrome, hallucinations and possibly psychosis)

When I said I brought a list, he said he'd rather I tell him about it myself. Fair enough, I tried to. He interrupted me before I could get into the second diagnosis on my list, telling me not to use words like ""depersonalisation"" for myself. Those words are for people that are really sick, not people like me. 

He kept asking me what my boyfriend does and if he's mentally stable, if I'm happy with him. The appointment was supposed to last an hour, we were done in 15 minutes because he didn't ask me anything about me. He dismissed everything I said I was experiencing, he said I was making myself more sick than I actually was. He said I was a really sensitive, frail person and I shouldn't use medical terms to describe my symptoms. 

He ended the appointment with a well-loved classic, I need to go on runs, it works just as well as an anti-depressant! I have chronic back issues and am not supposed to run. I told him that and got the ""stop making yourself more sick than you are, you're young and healthy"" speech again.

I'm so exhausted, that was such a terrible appointment and I feel so stupid now. I'll never go there again.

mentalhealth,The saying that mental health disorders are ‚Äúinvisible illnesses‚Äù is the biggest joke I‚Äôve ever heard.,"I keep hearing this repeated all the time, even by mental health processionals. While I agree 100% that these disorders are indeed illnesses, the ‚Äúinvisible‚Äù part is just a lie. I understand that they‚Äôre called this because the root of the problem is in the brain/mind, but it still seems ridiculous to me. No matter how mild your mental illness affects you, you can‚Äôt hide all of your symptoms. Usually, people just turn a blind eye to them, and claim them as ‚Äúinvisible‚Äù.

mentalhealth,Best friend took her own life: the aftermath and everything else,"November 2020 my best friend(17F) committed suicide. It was honestly one of the most traumatic things I've ever had to go through, and my boyfriend(18M) and I also broke up about a week after her death. (Just to clarify, he didn't break up with me because he didn't want to deal with me going through my best friend's suicide. Our breakup was a long time coming, it just unfortunately happened at a really bad time).

November through January was the most difficult time of my life. I struggled so so much. I think I had so much trauma from that time, that I literally cannot remember a single thing from those two and a half months. I just remember this constant feeling of numbness and having a breakdown every couple of days. I missed my ex-boyfriend and I missed my best friend so so much. Somehow I've lost my two best friends, the two most important people in my life only eight days apart. It was awful. 

I'm doing much much better now. I've made new friends, I've kissed new boys, I'm going to social events with my friends (Covid is currently under control in my country, don't worry xx). I've realized that breaking up with my now ex-boyfriend was one of the best things I've EVER done for myself. Please don't get me wrong, he's a phenomenal person with a beautiful heart. I still have so much love for him, but we weren't meant to be together in the long run, and I've realized that now. Our relationship became toxic, not because either of us were toxic individuals, but because we weren't good for each other anymore. 

As for my best friend... Zara my beautiful beautiful angel. I miss you every day, but I know how much pain you were in. This world didn't deserve you, sunflower-child. I still feel you everywhere around me. I feel you when the sun hits my back when I'm laughing with my friends at school, I feel you when I'm making out with younger boys on golf courses and I know you would've approved. I feel you around me when I'm drinking beers with my boys and dancing with my girls.  You're always around, I know it!

I miss you so much, but I know you're in a place where you're happy, and that you're finally at a place where you don't have pain and where you can truly be yourself. I love you, you selfless and kind person.

mentalhealth,I am one day free of abusive relationships,"So I (27M) moved house yesterday away from my ex girlfriend who was emotionally abusive and controlling since we first started dating 9 years ago and only recently did I realise how bad she actually was. 

We broke up about 6 months ago and have been living together as housemates till now and after finally moving out my sense of relief is so enormous I just want to cry. Even as housemates she was still super controlling and never gave me privacy or respect, she'd burst into my room at random moments without knocking, no matter what I was doing she would sit on my bed uninvited and talk for ages about herself to demand my attention and I was called rude if my replies weren't what she wanted. She'd never let me have a say or input about anything that went into the house, it was all just her decisions and that was final. 

I've just moved into a share house which I was terrified about since I've never lived with anyone else before and my new housemates are really lovely and welcoming and it actually feels like my place aswell. it's a weird feeling not having anyone to ""answer"" to any more but I guess it's the feeling of actual freedom! 

After narcissistic parents who were controlling and emotionally abusive too Its been a weird rough time getting to this point but my healing begins today.

mentalhealth,I keep thinking ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather die than deal with anything stressful‚Äù but I don‚Äôt want to actually die.,"I always feel like anything I say or think is ‚Äúbeing dramatic‚Äù like in dealing with Jeckyl and Hyde in my head.  I worry and stress about things that have happened, will happen, might happen, might not happen, or surely won‚Äôt happen.  My day is consumed with these thoughts to the point where I get a migraine, cry it out, hold it in, get mad.... I‚Äôve been on anxiety medication... all of them, off and on for years.  At the point now where I‚Äôm too anxious to take anxiety medication because I‚Äôm anxious to get side effects.  Backwards I know...  I‚Äôve seen a therapist before but not for awhile.  I always felt like I was bothering them.

But I feel strange for being like this because I am 33, I‚Äôm married, have three kids, a house, a job, a nice large family, lots of friends and cousins and a dog etc and there‚Äôs no issues... but most days I end my day thinking ‚ÄúI feel like if I just were to die, I wouldn‚Äôt have to deal with these feelings anymore, and I‚Äôd be free.‚Äù And that‚Äôs in regards to my irrational worry and negative thoughts that I alone put in my head.  But I don‚Äôt want to die.  I‚Äôm afraid of dying actually.  

I‚Äôve been fine my entire life except for when I had my second son 11 years ago.  He was born with club foot.  I spent all my maternity leave going to Children‚Äôs hospital for castings, surgery, etc. He had an MRI last year and got orthopedics.  He‚Äôs fine and happy and healthy.  But since he was born I changed and I‚Äôve developed panic attacks, anxiety, depression, IBS that put me in the ER 4 times, ulcers.  I worry that bad things will happen to me or my kids non stop.  I can‚Äôt stop the play button.  

So yes this is kind of venting but I‚Äôm at a loss and I try not to talk about this with anything because I feel like I‚Äôm being too whiny and dramatic.  Everyone‚Äôs response is always your son is fine now, basically get over it.  But I‚Äôve always felt like I had some sort of PTSD (I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs actually what it would be) after my sons situation because I‚Äôve never gotten over what he went through and what I went through mentally and financially because of it.

Any advice on where I should go from here or what I should do... would be appreciated.","I don't have a specific plan of action for you, obviously, but I just want to pull a few things out of your post and reframe/normalize them a little bit.

> At the point now where I‚Äôm too anxious to take anxiety medication because I‚Äôm anxious to get side effects

This is normal, not backwards! A lot of people with anxiety or anxiety symptoms are highly sensitive to their bodies and any changes that occur within them. 

>I‚Äôve seen a therapist before but not for awhile. I always felt like I was bothering them.

Lots of people feel this way too but in this case, it sounds like these feelings might be part of a pattern where you minimize your feelings and needs. You're definitely not bothering a therapist (if a therapist acts like you are, they're not good at their job and you should get a new one). Your post is full of phrases indicating that you are sort of shaming yourself for feeling this way, and you're expecting a therapist to tell you to get over it. It sounds like other people in your life have reinforced this as well, which is shitty and wrong. You deserve to address what you're going through and to feel better! Any therapist and anyone who values you would agree. Your kids need a mom who loves herself and knows her own value and the importance of honoring her own feelings as well.

> But I feel strange for being like this because I am 33, I‚Äôm married, have three kids, a house, a job, a nice large family, lots of friends and cousins and a dog etc and there‚Äôs no issues... 

First of all, your life situation doesn't need to merit how you're feeling. You don't need to ""earn"" whatever mental health symptoms you're going through. That's just not how it works. That's why they have Michael Phelps on those Talkspace commercials! He won a bazillion Olympic gold medals and he's married to a model and he's depressed. That's just how it works! 

HOWEVER you did go through something. Your kid is fine and happy and healthy now (yay!) but omg babies, and your OWN baby, holy shit, you experienced this huge jarring, life-altering situation where your baby came out with something ""wrong"" and that opened your eyes to the fact that a whole world full of possibilities beyond your control could happen at any time. What a huge thing to happen at an incredibly vulnerable time in your life, and it didn't even happen only to you, it happened to your baby! The person you feel so protective of, at the most vulnerable time. And it affected you financially, it took away from your maternity leave, I'm sure it impacted other things. No wonder you got freaked the hell out and still haven't recovered. Sure, yes, having a club foot is no big deal medically in a sense, and your kid is fine, but that's not the point. Your brain isn't concerned with that. Your brain is concerned with possibilities (omg so many) and what's within your control (omg not much) and your radar has been on overload since you experienced this very real incident.

People who don't get it, won't get it, but that doesn't mean you're being dramatic and whiny. It means you've been through something and it's affected you deeply. Your best bet now is to find a therapist, preferably one who specializes in anxiety disorders or trauma, and explain the situation. The goal isn't to learn that you're being dramatic and to stop, the goal is to understand how to modulate your responses so you can cope in your daily life. It's not about getting over it, it's about learning how to incorporate what happened and how you feel about it into healthier responses now. 

The first major part of this is to honor what you went through though. Your reactions make sense, they're just keyed up to the point where they're interfering with your life now. Therapy can help turn the volume down. You're not wrong to worry about things, that's normal, but you don't need that worry to escalate beyond your ability to manage it healthily. You're also showing your kids by example that their feelings matter, even if they're a little over the top, and they deserve to have them be taken seriously, and that if they're too much sometimes, it's okay to find someone to help.

Best of luck!!",429,16,2021-02-03 17:09:52,lbsf28

mentalhealth,I tried to commit suicide but my friends walked in the right time. Ready to make a change and open up,"Two months ago, I was fired as my Firm was cutting employees due the pandemic. I was all set to live a nice life overseas but all went down hill in a matter on months. Since then, I've been feeling as if I'm empty inside and lost all hope. At them time, it seemed that life wasn't worth living as everything I had worked hard for, went in vain. Since childhood I made sure to make my body my number one priority so I never drank alcohol or did drugs. But as things went bad, I started taking percs and lean to ease the pain. Some time ago, I took one too many pills and was overdosing. My friends broke into my room and found me having a seizure. I was rushed to the E. R.

mentalhealth,Everyone cares so much about mental health until it comes to parts that aren't romanticized.,"I'm so tired of this. I'm mainly speaking from experience. I know so many people that advocate for mental health but in reality they are just doing that to make themselves look good like they don't actually care. Those same people complain about their friends that are being ""too negative"" , those same people brag about dropping certain friends because they spend too much time alone and¬† never want to hang out, those are the same people that are embarrassed to be seen with their friend in public because they have self harm scars and are wearing short sleeves. They literally think that depression is just being sad and anxiety is like just being nervous about an exam. They have this version in their heads of what mental illness is that's so far from what it actually is. They kind of glamorize it in a way but there is nothing glamorous about having a mental illness. 

Again I'm just speaking from experience but i know so many people like this and it really pisses me off, they advocate so much for mental health yet they know nothing about it. They don't even try to empathize or provide some support instead they actually want nothing to do with a mentally ill person, they judged you and they just try to push toxic positivity onto you. I recently got diagnosed with depression, general anxiety disorder and CPTSD. I've had friends call me gross because at one point my depression got so bad that I didn't showed in 4 days, I've had friends that called me dramatic when I almost had a panic attack in public, I've had friends that got angry at me for not wanting to watch a movie because certain scenes triggers my PTSD, I've had friends that judged for having suicidal thoughts and they told me that ""I should think happy thoughts"" or ""You shouldn't be so negative all the time"" or ""You should be grateful because your life isn't as bad as others"". 

Those are the same people that are apart of all the mental health groups/clubs at my school and they post all over their social media for mental health awareness month and suicide prevention month but in reality they don't care about any of that. This person that I know that advocates so much for mental health once gave me a whole lecture because they thought that I was self diagnosing  (this was before I was actually diagrams with anything) and all I did was tell them that my mental health has been really bad and that I've been feeling depressed and struggled with anxiety for a really long time. I had to explain to them that you can still struggle with your mental health even if you're not diagnosed with any mental illness and they told me that I can't say that I'm feeling depressed without actually being diagnosed with depression. I'm sorry for the rant, I'm just so tired of all these hypocrites that pretend to care just so that they could look good and feel better about better about themselves.",I definitely understand and have noticed also.

mentalhealth,My experience in a psych ward,"Last Saturday, February 27th, was the one year anniversary of my ex cheating on me, I had really bad thoughts about harming her, like if I could end her life all my problems would be fixed. See, she was abusive to me and her cheating on me broke me mentally and sent me into a downward spiral that I thought was bipolar disorder. 

I had spoken with both my family doctor and a psychiatrist, and they both agreed that it seemed to be type 2 bipolar disorder. So, I started taking medicine for it. Now, let's jump back to last Saturday.

I realized these thoughts I were having were dangerous and that I needed serious help immediately, so I told my parents to take me to the hospital, being a bit vague on the details, and they did. I got to the ER and told the nurse everything that had been happening and I was sent to a bare room with only a boxed-in tv on the wall as an SIHI, meaning I was both suicidal and homocidal. 

The doctors at my hospital evaluated me and sent a report off to a bugger hospital an hour away that had a dedicated psych ward for patients like me. After 4 hours of waiting, I got the news that this better hospital would accept me as a patient. So, within 15min, I was in an ambulance and on my way to the psych ward.

When I arrived, I was immediately taken to a room where my vitals were recorded and my possessions were taken away, and I had to sign papers agreeing to treatment and their policies. Once I had completed the paperwork, I was made to put on a pair of no-slip socks for safety and was shown to my room. 

It was a fairly bare room, with just a desk to store what few clothes I could bring and two beds. I had to share my room with a nice old man named Arthur, who was there for mild schizophrenia. We also shared a simple bathroom with a toilet, sink, and shower. 

The operation of the psych ward were fairly simple. Meals were at 7:30, 11, and 4:30, and snacks were at 9, 2, and 8:30. We had ""group,"" at 10, 3, and 8 where we learned coping mechanism, positive thinking skills, and did occupational therapy to learn healthy hobbies and habits to give us an outlet for stress and creativity.

 They didnt force you to eat or go to group, though. Some of the patients only came out for meals and slept the rest of the day. Most of us stayed in the common room which had a water fountain and tv. We ended up watching HGTV or the Food Network most of the time. We did watch some Star Wars, too,  which was nice

Each shift change, a new nurse was assigned to you, and they were all very nice in my experience. They brought me my daytime medicine right around 9am and my nighttime medicine around 8pm. Every morning and night your nurse would come to you and ask you questions like how your day was, to rate your anxiety and depression on a scale of 1-10, and so forth. 

Your doctor would come around every morning as well to discuss outpatient plans with you to get you set up for when you leave the hospital, as well as discuss or change your medications. My doctor ended up changing my Lexapro for Prozac, upping my dosage of Lamictal, and adding Remoron to the mix. 

Alongside the doctor, I also saw a psychologist who gave me a thorough evaluation. He let me sit down and talk to him about my life leading up to how I got to the psych ward, and he filled up 3 pages full of notes. Afterwards, I took a 567 true/false quiz called the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) and the Rorschach Test. 

I was in the psych ward until today, March 3rd. Before I left, I had one last talk with my doctor, who gave me a briefing on the psychologist's report. It turns out, I have autism. Specifically, I have Asperger's, so that was a pretty big shock to me. 

I think the biggest thing I learned in my stay at the psych ward was that the other patients are just like you and me. They're completely normal people who just need some help. None of them were mean or psychopaths. They were all just average joes with bad anxiety, depression, and ADHD. I thoroughly enjoyed talking with and getting to know them. 

So, thanks for reading about my experience in a psych ward. I will be more than happy to answer any questions you have",You sound like a very nice person. Hope and healing to you.,420,31,2021-03-04 13:43:11,lxkry4

And for the first time, I believed her.
After starting my antidepressants everything slowly got clearer and brighter. 
I even got a friend at school! An actual friend that wants to talk to me! She sometimes laughs at the fact that I say ""thank you"" every time she agrees to go somewhere with me but I'm just so happy and surprised that I'm talking to people.
I never thought I could be this happy. I feel like I'm 12 again, happy with friends, going out. I never thought it was possible to get out of the lowest of the lows.

It's still not perfect but it's definitely enough for now. I'm still not in a safe situation when it comes to my sexuality, but I have support from my roommate, who likes to give me tough love from time to time, from my English teacher who's an absolute sweetheart, my friend from school who likes me for who I am, my online friend who's probably reading this right now (love you bitch) and my cats who are the sweetest and most annoying creatures ever.

mentalhealth,Why do older generation people think depression is something we make up and it's just a western concept?,"Yesterday my mom was nagging me to tell her why I have been behaving weirdly. I got fed up and told her I have been in depression for years and she called my dad.

Well for starters they don't believe I'm in depression because ""my face doesn't seem sad"". Secondly I'm not a doctor so I can't diagnose myself with depression and since I learned about depression from google, apparently by reading too much about it my brain made me think I'm in depression. And that it didn't exist years back, and it's just western culture and not exactly real.

When I told them a few reasons that included them, they are saying this is what happens everywhere meaning this happens in every household and they don't see them depressed.

Honestly I'm tired. But atleast after seeing me cry for hours, they are searching for some therapists or psychologists nearby.","As my counsellor told me, older generations really didn't have much emotional intelligence. Think of the stigma around mental health that was around until very recently, I think the farther back you go the worse it would have been. So I can picture their parents not giving the time of day to their emotions, which caused them to learn to suppress and ignore them which is probably all they know, to then unintentionally pass that type of thinking on to you. 

Also to have clinical depression sure you'd need a diagnosis, but anyone and everyone at some point will feel depressed. What I mean is its not just a condition, its also an emotional state that everyone will experience at some point",396,38,2021-04-05 04:14:54,mkcdzb

mentalhealth,How do I(22F) get over the trauma that a kid(9F) put me through?,"I know I sound like a wimp, but keep reading.

I am an mental health tech, and my job is to basically be a glorified babysitter for special needs kids. I'm good at my job, but something last night makes me start shaking when I think about it. 

One of my clients scares me. I don't know her exact problem, but her father told me that her mother had done dope and drank alcohol when she was pregnant with her. 

This girl was throwing a tantrum after we left a pet store. She insisted that she held cats (which we couldn't because covid.) First she whined, then she cried, then she snapped. I had to call her mother, and we stayed on the phone with her to get her to leave the pet store, literally one step at a time. 

When we got to the car, she began *screaming* at the top of her lungs that she wanted my tablet to play games on. I wouldn't let her, because she already threatened to break it. This lasted for twenty minutes. I drove with her, another client, and my shadower(new hire in training), to the highway. The girl suddenly stopped screaming, unbuckled herself, and got up next to me while I was driving 70mph. She leaned against me, and told me that I was ugly, had no friends, deserved to die, and would kill me if I let her. She began reaching for the wheel all slowly and dramatically like she was going to yank it into the oncoming traffic from my left side. The shadower yanked her back, but she kept lunging for the wheel, trying to make us crash into the other cars. I eventually pulled over on the side of the highway and called her mom. The girl then opened the car door and tried to run out into the field, saying that she was going to get us in trouble for losing her. We dragged her back into the car, and put on the child lock. She didn't like that, and tried to fight us once we got settled again. When her mom finally came, she started acting all nice, denying everything that happened. She took the child home, and we took the other client home.

I forgive this girl, because she has a mental illness and couldn't control herself. Yet, I can't stop shaking, and I couldn't sleep that night because I kept dreaming about deadly car crashes. Car crashes are one of my biggest fears, I cant help but feel terrified when I even think about getting in one. I get genuinely scared when I picture her in my mind, and deep down I want her dead. 

I will have to see her again, only time I will be prepared. How do I get over this fear that causes me to black out, start trembling, and cant form words correctly? 

&#x200B;

TLDR: Client almost got me and a car full of people killed, and I can't get over the fear of being around her now. How do I get over this fear and continue my job as a mental health tech?","I can‚Äôt really help you, but just know that you aren‚Äôt a wimp just because of the age difference. That was a genuinely terrifying situation and you have every right to be traumatised about it. Besides, everyone‚Äôs brains work differently and you can‚Äôt change the fact you are traumatised. Sorry this is off-topic, I just felt the need to say that. Have a nice day!

EDIT: I got a notification saying this got over 100 upvotes and so I read it back and now I realised I vastly understated what you went through, so, sorry about that.

mentalhealth,I don‚Äôt give a shit if someone is ‚Äúfaking‚Äù anxiety/depression.,"Disclaimer: this isn‚Äôt targeted at any one individual or group, but rather a school of thought that seems to have penetrated everyday discourse surrounding mental health. If I say ‚Äúyou‚Äù or ‚Äúyou people‚Äù, I‚Äôm referring to people who subscribe to the bullshit thinking I‚Äôm about to outline. This was meant to be posted to r/unpopularopinion but got deleted, so I figured y‚Äôall could appreciate my sentiment instead.

It seems like whenever I see a post about mental health (outside of subs that are directly related to the concept), the same point comes up.

*‚ÄùDuH‚Ä¶ like 90% of people who say they have depression are just faking it for attention! All those kids on TikTok just want to LARP as Billie Eilish and pretend they have a mental illness so they can be trendy!!‚Äù*

Just, stop. And I say this as someone with *diagnosed* depression, anxiety and ADHD. Here‚Äôs why this way of thinking is complete and utter **horse shit**.

First off, depression/anxiety are *incredibly* common, and exist on a wide spectrum of severity. When people see someone who claims they‚Äôre depressed, but still manages to go to work/school without many problems, they automatically jump to the thought of ‚Äúoh well they seem to be doing pretty well. they‚Äôre not *really* depressed.‚Äù

This is such bullshit because unless you‚Äôve advanced science by 5 decades and figured out how to read someone else‚Äôs thoughts, you don‚Äôt know what the fuck they‚Äôre going through. Even if that ‚Äúnormal‚Äù person seems functional, there‚Äôs no telling what‚Äôs going on in their head. 

You think everyone who has ‚Äúreal‚Äù depression is a lifeless sack of garbage who sits in bed crying all day? Guess what, there‚Äôs probably a handful of people at your job/in your class that have ‚Äúreal‚Äù depression. They just hide it well because that‚Äôs what people with mental health issues *have to do* in order to succeed.

Second, on the flip side of the coin, *so many* people assume the complete opposite. ‚ÄúThis person has depression and ADHD, but doesn‚Äôt take care of themselves and can‚Äôt hold down a job without breaking down? God, another faker, huh? That‚Äôs not mental illness, that‚Äôs *laziness*‚Äù.

Like, *what the fuck is wrong with you???* That‚Äôs literally what severe mental illness does to you? If ‚Äúdepression‚Äù can‚Äôt exist if you‚Äôre doing well on the surface, and it *also* can‚Äôt exist if you‚Äôre doing terribly on the surface, then what the hell do you think depression is!?

But even putting aside the obvious lack of understanding regarding mental health, it‚Äôs *still* fucked up to call someone out as a ‚Äúfaker‚Äù.

Look at it this way, let‚Äôs say someone actually *is* faking it. They post on social media claiming they have depression, but they actually don‚Äôt.

*WHO FUCKING CARES?*

Even if they don‚Äôt have a diagnosed mental illness, they clearly aren‚Äôt getting the attention they need outside of social media. And since when is asking for attention a bad thing? Most of the people who receive these complaints are *literally children.* You think that if a fucking *child* is resorting to random strangers online for support, there‚Äôs absolutely *nothing* wrong with them? And they *don‚Äôt* need people to hear them out? Of fucking course not!!

And here‚Äôs the biggest problem. WHO ARE WE TO DECIDE WHETHER SOMEONE IS FAKING OR NOT?

Mental illness transcends class, race and gender. Nobody is immune from chronic depression/anxiety. 99% of the time you *cannot fucking tell* if someone has a mental illness or not. Because it‚Äôs a **M E N T A L** illness. 

So why take the chance on saying ‚Äúoh they‚Äôre just lying for attention‚Äù, when there‚Äôs a strong possibility that they‚Äôre serious and you‚Äôre just making it worse by making them feel like an impostor?

Seriously, what does anyone stand to gain from calling someone out for ‚Äúfaking it‚Äù? 

‚ÄúOh, but the more people who fake it, the more stigma there will be against people who have *actual* mental illness.‚Äù

Bull. Shit. Where do you think that stigma is coming from? Because it sure as fuck isn‚Äôt coming from people who actually care about mental health.

It‚Äôs coming from people like you, who refuse to believe that mental illness can affect *everyone*. No mental health professional, or doctor, or caring person is shutting these people down. It‚Äôs just people like you. The resources to treat mental health are always available, but people who need them aren‚Äôt getting them because they‚Äôre constantly told that they‚Äôre making it worse for people who have ‚Äúreal‚Äù mental illness.

And one more thing.

‚ÄúOh you probably self-diagnosed, didn‚Äôt you? That means your mental illness isn‚Äôt real.‚Äù

Oh, fuuuuuuck off.

First of all, how do you think you get a diagnosis in the first place? You think a doctor is gonna come to your house, take one look at you and say ‚Äúyep, you‚Äôve got depression‚Äù. That‚Äôs not how it works! You get a diagnosis by recognizing symptoms within yourself, condensing them and narrowing it down to a few possibilities, then bringing that info to a professional when/if you can. This process is known as, you guessed it, **self-diagnosis**.

And what about people who *can‚Äôt* get diagnosed? I‚Äôm lucky enough to live in a place where mental health is taken seriously and covered by insurance. So, I was able to be diagnosed and treated from a young age.

What about people who aren‚Äôt so lucky? In the US, you can pay up to $500 for an initial consultation. Not everyone can afford that. And in some countries, mental health treatment is a fucking joke.  It‚Äôs chocked up to weakness or insanity sometimes, so good luck getting a diagnosis in one of those places. And actually getting a prescription for meds? That‚Äôs a whole other mountain to climb, even in more progressive countries.

So if you‚Äôre in an area where getting a diagnosis is next to impossible, what are you supposed to do? Just sit there feeling miserable and telling no one because you ‚Äúmight be faking it‚Äù? Fuck no, you get online and do what you can to find support and raise awareness for others in your situation.

Bottom line, nobody knows what mental illnesses someone else is or isn‚Äôt dealing with. And even if you do, why the hell do you care?

You‚Äôre not helping anyone. You‚Äôre not saving resources for people who ‚Äúactually‚Äù need them. All you‚Äôre doing is making everybody feel worse.","Yessir. A cry for help is a cry for help, no matter how ridiculous of a cry it may seem.",381,42,2021-08-31 17:08:37,pfa5s6

This is a normal part of growing up and going through different parts of life.

Just don‚Äôt expect it to be changed by tomorrow, but luckily for you, time moves fast.

Remember that you have to drive the change you want to see, no one will do it for you.

Hear me out:

Yes, of course it‚Äôs a choice when life is going well for you because your baseline is already happy. It‚Äùs actually EASY to choose happiness when you‚Äôre already happy.

But when you are facing a hardship in life or you are feeling depressed- You are not waking up to sunshine and rainbows and butterflies everyday. Choosing happiness might not be in the cards for you when you‚Äôre struggling just to make it through the day. And that might not seem fair, especially when you see the people around you enjoying life and living so lightly.

But believe it or not, the struggles you are faced with are fair because in the end they are a damn GIFT. It may not feel like it now, it feels horrible and heartbreaking and hopeless. But slowly but surely each day will get better and you will get through it and become a stronger person.

But I am seeing all these perfectly normal individuals talking about their experiences with mental illness mainly because of their family members. What am I supposed to feel?!

I feel like they'd be happier not having to worry about me anymore. Its almost like I'm mad at these people (and cat) for caring so much about me. It makes this process take so much more thought and deliberation. All of which I thought I had done beforehand this time. I want to cry for help but I can't because it makes me feel like even more of a burden. I'm only 26 why the hell am I like this. Im so mad. Sure my life hasn't been the greatest but it sure as hell hasn't been as bad as it could have been. I hate feeling all of these things. I'm in therapy and taking an antidepressant but I don't feel like anything is working anymore. I feel like my mind just won't stop. Ever. My coping skills don't always work and I'm tired. Sorry for dumping all of this. I just don't know what else to do.","I'll show you some very good suicide prevention info, but first I want to say this about overcoming depression -  
  
If you could win a prize by hitting a target with an arrow and the arrows were free, what would you say to someone who asked you, ""How many arrows do you want?"" You wouldn't say, ""Which is the best one?"" You'd say, ""How many can I have?""   
  
The beauty of self-help is that you have a variety of low cost, low risk things that can be combined with each other, and with standard treatments with office visits. While it's not clear at this time that any one of these things is as effective as an antidepressant, it's common sense that if a variety of reasonably good things are combined with each other, they will have considerable effect.  
  
I'll tell you more. First, this -   
  
The most important thing is knowing how to cope in a moment of crisis. It's very important to calm down. This will make you feel better and let you think clearly. A very easy way to calm down is just to breathe slowly. Dialectical Behavior Therapy, which helps people who have BPD, recommends this - breathe gently, hand on your belly to feel it go in and out, and breathe 5 seconds in-breath and 7 seconds out-breath till you feel OK.   
   
Simple distractions can help. The video below shows you distractions that can calm you down, also a safe hotline. No one will bother you if you call.

As I do think about suicide often but I don't want to do that to my family, friends and pets. Or an accident like getting hot by a car.  At least then my loved ones wouldn't blame themselves or feel guilty or keep wondering why. Because I want to go, but I can't do that to them. my friend told me if I killed myself then she would too, I can't let that happen, but every day it gets worse and worse. I hope I can get on antidepressants soon.",I completely get what you mean. I used to wish I would get cancer so that I could die without hurting everyone. It sounds terrible but people understand physical illness more than they understand mental illness and it makes a big difference in how you are treated.

""If you are depressed, if you are anxious, you're not weak, you're not crazy... you're a human being with unmet needs.""","It's not at all a stretch to say that most of humanity lives in a civilization oriented around producing profits (for someone else) at the cost of our lives.

If your needs were met, you would spend your most productive hours of the day (e.g. 9am to 5pm) caring for yourself and your loved ones.

Instead, almost all of humanity spends our most productive hours of the day in complete powerlessness, subjected to the will of another, as we receive a fraction of the value we produce for them.

We work and live in totalitarian institutions. This powerlessness is extremely harmful for our psyche and further damages our social relations.

mentalhealth,My dog has no clue he saved my life,"My little homie has no idea what he did.

I have always found it hard to reach out for help, always worrying about being a burdon to others, even when they said they were open.

Around March I had gotten back from a class trip which I had made some friends, opened up to people, and had a great going social life, something I always struggle with. But as you know what happened in March had some different plans.

My school was closed off, the only way I had contact to these people, I had a couple friends numbers, but didn‚Äôt really see them and drifted a bit apart.

I was plunged back into a state of loneliness I felt like I had no one, I still had peoples contact info, but being autistic means I extremely struggle with reaching out. This caused me to spiral

Thoughts of un worth, fear, and trapped filled me. I was a shell.

It came to a head when after long suffering I thought, this needs to end. I walked out of my room wondering the quickest, and painless way to end it.

I looked over and saw something, my German shepherd chilling on his bean bag. I curled up on the bag and vented, cried, and he just listened.

In the end, I left the beanbag feeling as though I am worthy of life. I had already tied a noose, I had access to knives, but little drago was there.

He had no idea, he didn‚Äôt pull me out of a fire, he didn‚Äôt fight off a bear, but by just being there he saved me.

It‚Äôs been over half a year now, I‚Äôve learned to talk more. I‚Äôve even for the first time in a long time, invited someone out. Im now indulging in my love of bikes and engineering. I‚Äôve healed, I‚Äôm now even starting to accept my neurodiversity and masking less.

All this improvement wouldn‚Äôt happen if the family German shepherd wasn‚Äôt sitting on the bean bag that night. He has no idea what he did.

Thanks for reading, reaching out about my mental health had been a goal for 2021

mentalhealth,I cleaned my appartment and invited someone over!,"I struggle with anxiety and depression, I haven't eat a proper meal (only bread and crisps) in a whole week because I can't gather the courage to cook, I just lay in bed all day doing nothing (it's even too hard to watch TV shows, or youtube videos) and only get up to pee and smoke cigarettes.

Two days ago I had a phone call with my psychiatrist, she increased my meds again and gave me a few recommendations. Among them, she suggested I see a friend IRL. I don't have any friends in the city where I study, only an acquaintance from my marine biology courses.

Just after hanging up with my psychiatrist, I sent this acquaintance a weird message, proposing her to come over. I'm not really sure why but she accepted, and even seemed happy!

So yesterday, even if I didn't really feel like it, I cleaned my whole appartment, put on nice clothes, and I even went grocery shopping (I usually hate that, it drains too much of the few energy I have lol).

She came on the afternoon. We made some snacks together, and ate them watching a movie. I had feared a lot it would be awkward because we don't know each other a lot, but it was really fun!

I was super exhausted after that (and went directly to sleep at 6pm, oops), but also super glad I did it!

And in bonus, I had some snacks leftovers I ate for diner (when I woke up at 11pm, but still), and a clean appartment!

(Sorry for the probably weird english, I'm not a natural speaker)","Your English is good, it sounds very formal and I understood exactly what you were saying.

mentalhealth,I am schizophrenic. I have the right to say no.,"I‚Äôm sick and fucking tired of people and doctors treating me like I don‚Äôt have the right to refuse treatment because of my illness. I don‚Äôt like the pills. It‚Äôs not because I have schizophrenia, it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre fucking poison. Not in a ‚ÄútHE gOVeRnMeNT iS pOIsOnINg mE‚Äù way, but in a ‚Äúantipsychotic medications reduce lifespan by 20 years way‚Äù. I‚Äôm 17. These drugs cause permanent long term damage. They‚Äôre directly linked to strokes, heart attacks, hormonal imbalances, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, diabetes, abnormal heart rhythms, dyskinesia, and more. A cancer patient has the right to refuse treatment, and their affliction is lethal. Why don‚Äôt I have the right to say no? Because ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt think clearly about the consequences of my actions‚Äù? Cancer patients can‚Äôt comprehend what it is to die, none of us can. How about parents of kids with lethal illnesses? They can refuse treatment to their child for religious reasons, religion in and of itself is delusion. So why is their delusion given more weight than when I point out fact? When what I‚Äôm saying can be proven. When what I‚Äôm saying is logical, because let‚Äôs fucking face it, nobody in their right mind would take these fucking pills. They put me on 8mg of risperdal for my first antipsychotic. 8. Fucking. Milligrams. It didn‚Äôt work. Nor did my dick. Nor did my appetite. Nor did my brain. You all expect me to just play along and trust that you all have my best interest in mind and it‚Äôs fucking disgusting. YOU have NO interest in my long-term health. It‚Äôs not you that always twitches, it‚Äôs not you that wants to die, it‚Äôs not you that‚Äôll get fat and grow tits as a 17 year old male, it‚Äôs not you with ED, it‚Äôs not your heart that‚Äôll be diseased, it‚Äôs not you whose body will waste away day by day, it‚Äôs me. And I won‚Äôt have it.

Edit: for those of you who underestimate even just the metabolic damage these drugs cost I will give you first hand what my experience was. When I started the risperidone (risperdal) I wanted to be and stay healthy. To an obsessive amount. I ate in a 500 calorie deficit of only healthy Whole Foods, lots of vegetables, lean meat, no processed garbage. I went to the gym 6 times a week, did a full body split workout regiment with weights, and then went on the treadmill for an hour and ran 10km, then I went on the stair master for half an hour at as difficult a pace I could manage. I was easily burning 1,000 calories per session from the cardio alone. I GAINED 15 pounds. Eating in a deficit, running 6.2 miles 6 times a week, plus 30 minutes of stair master. I would run on shin splints and stress fractures I didn‚Äôt care that it hurt it just felt so amazing to accomplish what I could. But I was getting literally fatter by the day. I was obsessed. I‚Äôve never had issues with eating disorders or body dysmorphia (unless looking in the mirror and seeing a different face counts but that‚Äôs not the same thing) these drugs make weight-loss or maintenance borderline impossible. Many people who go on antipsychotics struggle for years to lose the weight and many never get back to their original weight. These drugs make you hungry in a way that‚Äôs almost indescribable. It‚Äôs a hunger in your intestines, and no matter how much you fill your stomach your intestines still hurt, they ache and cramp as they tell you desperately that you need food. You eat and eat and you can‚Äôt fucking stop. I ate 6 heads of lettuce in one sitting and was still STARVING. That‚Äôs so much volume and fiber nobody should be able to consume that much lettuce, but it didn‚Äôt even phase me.

Edit 2: for those stating antipsychotic medication does not reduce lifespan by 20 years, this statement comes from the overall life expectancy of schizophrenics being reduced by 20 years, and the leading cause of death for schizophrenics being Cardiovascular Disease. As previously stated, Antipsychotic medication is directly linked to metabolic damage and cardiovascular disease, which allows me to make the correlation between antipsychotics and lifespan.","If your schizophrenia doesn't end up with you in and out of jail for causing disturbances, or ends up with you harming others or yourself, then I really don't see a reason why you should have to medicate.

Plenty of people have schizophrenia and are no harmful than anyone else. I've met several as a mental health counselor. Some choose to medicate because therapy doesn't work for them, and they feel that they can't function without mitigating their symptoms.

Others choose not to.

Make sure you are aware of your rights as a patient and a human. I don't mean to sound patronizing here. It's important for everyone. Even I read up on it to remind myself.

Have a safe trip through life dude.",359,49,2021-09-09 05:51:25,pkrtbo
mentalhealth,Religion used to mess with my mental health SO MUCH,"There is just so much guilt. Guilt for not praying. Guilt for not fasting. Guilt for feeling sexually attracted to someone. Guilt for masturbating. Guilt for eating certain foods. Guilt for dressing a certain way. Guilt for things that are in no way hurting another human being. Guilt for everything.

I left religion some 6 or 7 years ago and I'm not gonna pretend my mental health is perfect right now, but letting it go has helped me let go of so much unnecessary guilt.

I still get anxious and jittery for no reason. And I still have days where I don't really feel like getting out of bed. But at least I don't go into a downward spiral and make things worse for myself by also shaming myself for missing prayers by not getting out of bed.

I'm proud of myself for letting go of something that was only hurting my mental health.","Yeah, telling children that they are going to burn in hell is very uncool.",352,34,2021-04-04 05:55:40,mjqakb
mentalhealth,It never ceases to amaze me how pets just KNOW when you are not okay.,"I'm in the middle of a depressive episode (I'm bipolar) and today, even if I haven't exteriorize it, my dog has been unusually clingy. He's been all day next to me, while lying in bed he's napping pressed against me (which he never does).

It's so amazing how pets just know when you need someone to feel less alone, how we need support and company.
Feeling grateful. 

How about you? Do your pets do this too?","I had to stop killing my meat chickens after they freaked out when I attempted suicide and kept freaking out when I started preparing to give it another try on the same day. I ate 6 of them and they still cared about me. I went and got my housemate and when they took me to the hospital the chickens tried to come with us. They followed my housemate around while I was gone, as if to ask, ""hey where's Nutmeg?"". When I came back they gathered around and made concerned noises until I could convince them I was okay. Then they left and ate bugs in the yard. Fatso was the most concerned because I often sat with her when she was trying to pop out one of her usual oversized eggs. So fatso let me pick her up, which was rare since her butt usually hurt. But she made worried chicken noises and didn't even fidget. She just looked at me and pecked me softly on the cheek, it didn't hurt. (If she was mad at me it would have. I've seen chickens rip fieldmice apart and play soccer with the remains. Those beaks can be quite the weapon.) Welp, I gave her a kiss back and set her down and she followed me over to the porch and she sat on the table next to my chair and popped out an egg. She was that worried, didn't even go to her nest, just popped it out on the picnic table.

That‚Äôs one example of my toxic positivity experience.","I cringe when I hear the term BE GRATEFUL. While I agree we should all be able to seek gratitude, that term triggers me as I heard it all my life from the miserable goons I‚Äôm related to. It dismisses and tries to invalidate feelings.

mentalhealth,"Social media (mostly tiktok) not only romanticizes, but also encourages self harm to young people.","As someone who is trying their hardest to recover and become clean from self harm, it‚Äôs really hard when I‚Äôm being recommended videos of girls showing off their scars, or having their scars in random videos, with no trigger warning might I add, and seeing comments of people saying ‚Äúsame ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚Äù or ‚Äúthe scars are such a mood‚Äù.

It breaks my heart for people who see that, assume that self harm is a normal coping mechanism, and that it‚Äôs ‚Äúokay‚Äù for them to start.

As harsh as this is, coming from someone trying to fight the urges, it is not normal to harm yourself to cope. Your brain is in an incredibly unhealthy state. We should NOT be normalizing sh.

I know that.  But these are scars that are 10 years old minimum.  And I will likely have them for the rest of my life.  I don't want my experience of my body to be defined by them, you know?

yeah I'm not pressuring myself or anything, I just see other people's lives and they're doing so much better than me, I get insecure because I'm so broken and run down to the point I don't get to even live my own life at this point.

I have frequent dissociation episodes so time, days, weeks don't really process well for me I'd be shocked that its already July and school is already starting for me.

I promised myself I'd get better and be better before school starts but now well, the moment has passed, and we're already starting.

It's just that when I'm stuck having mental health problems, time doesn't move for me. days don't feel like days, months feel like years, days just pass by constantly while I keep crying, I keep breaking down, I keep struggling and drowning.

mentalhealth,"people only care about mental illnesses that are cute, quiet, and make it easy to pity you. do you agree?","when my only diagnosis was depression and anxiety, i was easily pitied and white knighted. either by boys who thought being suicidal and helpless was sexy or with half assed attempts from mental health workers / volunteers. 

well my bpd symptoms got worse. instead of sulking when i am feeling self doubt or low self esteem i immediately project and lash out. this comes from a place of extreme pain and years of trauma but because it is a stark contrast to the inwardness of depression i rarely get the same attitude i did when i didn‚Äôt mention bpd symptoms. i see it constantly - no regard for anger as a mental health symptom in support communities, pointing fingers and calling the aggressive psychopathic, etc. 

people will advocate when you‚Äôre all cute and quiet and tiny and not making any noise. once your mental illness becomes external and your pain manifests into outbursts and aggression it‚Äôs completely dismissed and the person is disregarded and abandoned. 

this is why i am so afraid of having bpd. but that‚Äôs beside the point. i was wondering if you guys had any experience with this phenomenon.","I am pretty sure I have BPD but refuse to get diagnosed due to the stigma. I am a mental health professional and when people at work say there‚Äôs not much mental health stigma anymore it makes me laugh. 

BPD is a good example, but an even better one is narcissistic personality disorder. The word ‚Äúnarcissist‚Äù is thrown around with the same level of fear and hatred as ‚Äúschizophrenia‚Äù was back in the 80s. 
Everyone who is scummy and manipulative is a ‚Äúnarcissist‚Äù these days. No one knows what that word actually means, no one knows the suffering NPD patients experience. NPDs are not automatically abusive destructive monsters. They‚Äôre mentally ill people who need treatment.

For me personally a birthday is a license to do whatever I most enjoy! Even if I have to organize it myself it‚Äôs extremely liberating 

Sometimes I most enjoy quiet seclusion with favorite foods and media, sometimes I like to spend it with a few select people whose company I enjoy

I hope you have a happy birthday! I can‚Äôt imagine the loss you‚Äôve been through and whatever emotions you are feeling right now are valid- you don‚Äôt have to suppress them you don‚Äôt have to be happy every holiday

Maybe showing appreciation for your existing family and friends can help ease the pain or maybe a moment of remembrance for all your parents gave to you and what a wealth (even if not monetary wealth) you have because of them. It‚Äôs a gift",347,44,2021-03-16 15:41:38,m6bx36
mentalhealth,is my dad slapping my ass sexual assault,"for context, im 16 years old. my dad started ""playfully"" slapping my ass a while ago and at first it was just a silly joke kind of thing between us but then i started getting uncomfortable because he would also say stuff like my ass was too small while touching it. he said that guys liked girls with big butts and that i need to put on some weight. i kindly asked him to stop slapping my ass shortly after that and he got so butthurt, he said that he just wanted us to be close and that it was sad how he couldn't even joke with his own daughter and didn't stop. i made it clear to him that i didn't like it whenever he layed his hands on my ass and my mom would usually be there too, but said nothing. one day i started crying after he did it again and that made him stop. now whenever i bring it up and be like ""hey dad that wasn't very nice of you"", he starts gaslighting me and says that thats not what happened and that i'm making it up. this kinda turned into a vent thing lol im safe now but i just want to know if that counts as sexual assault.

edit: please stop telling me to report him, he didn't molest me, yes it might have escalated but it did not, i'm safe now, i love my dad and seeing people call him a pedo doesn't really help :(","Yes, without question. If I'm interpreting your context correctly, he's saying you need to change your figure to be more sexually appealing. Red flag #1. Theres a difference between playfully smacking someone's ass while playing sports, after hitting a walk off home run, and what you are describing. A grown man's hand has no place on a 16 year old girls ass. Period. Red flag #2. Going beyond the physical part of it, he's emotionally berating you stating your looks are not up to some ""standard"" of society. 

Get proof, such as an audio recording, and out him to a trusted family member, clergy member if religious, or school official.",346,59,2021-10-10 16:13:01,q5b264
mentalhealth,"Am I the only one who enjoys nothing and views life as an empty, pointless path towards death anyways?","Ever since my other parent ended up dying, I've turned into a toxically pessimistic piece of shit. To the point the discussion of my views has broken friendships. Life feels like an empty walk through a barren valley to death. Feels like there's absolutely nothing to work towards. Nobody to impress, nobody to be proud of me. Nobody to be happy or upset of who I turned into. It's just me, hoping to find my own meaning in life. Although there is none. Absolutely nothing at all can bring a smile to my face, besides driving so fast and dumb, I realize I almost died, then almost died again, and again. It goes so, so much deeper. Much more than I would ever tell Reddit or a psychiatrist. But leaving It as simple as this, please tell me I'm not alone. I can't be the only one who feels like their better meaning would be to just die. Is there a way to break free, or is this who I'm destined to be for the next 70 years of my life?","for good or bad, none of our feelings are our own. Everything we feel has also been felt by millions of other people across time, and even an untold number are going through the same feelings right now. This is good, because we can feel empathy and compassion for the others going through these rough emotions, and it is bad because we don't get to be 'special' or 'unique' because of our pain.

The ambiguity of life allows us to define our own purpose, and we see this everywhere - people adhering to religious doctrine, people focusing on their family, people pursuing their careers.

I had some trauma growing up and I've lost two my sisters, so now I am an only child, I've lost people to suicide, drug addiction, I had one friend lose his mind from benzodiazepines (edit: he was abusing them, not a prescription thing), I had one friend die to gang violence, the list goes on. People like you and me who go through pain like that, one of the purposes we can pursue is using our own understanding of pain to help and heal others going through rough times.

>Is there a way to break free, or is this who I'm destined to be for the next 70 years of my life?

I feel this a lot. In truth, I am not even the same person from moment to moment let alone day to day or year to year. Realizing that everything in our head (actually everything we experience) is constantly in flux, constantly changing, everything is impermanent: this is actually liberating because we can learn to let go. It is the clinging that is causing pain.",349,32,2021-03-29 13:12:15,mfpa1h
mentalhealth,Is it just me or does life just feel like shit,"Honestly, lately life has just felt well lifeless.  


People are angry at each other from all over the globe. Whether if it's because of politics, the pandemic, race, cops, etc. It just feels like everywhere people are just angry. If they aren't angry then they are most likely depressed given the state of the world and what's been going on. When you think of all those things together it really makes you feel like life has been shit and still is.   


The folks on the news always seem like they are either angry at something or have something negative to talk about. The people around me are uneasy with what's been going on. Jobs have been hard to come by when taking the pandemic into consideration. If you don't want to work with other people because you are scared of the virus that's a huge chunk of jobs you can't get. Even if you get a job it's been tough trying to get a place to live comfortably. The folks I know that have a place either work 90% of their week, have two jobs or are unable to treat themselves because they can't afford to.  


The most frustrating about all this is the lack of attention mental health has been getting. At least on a national level.  All you hear is cases and deaths with very few articles mentioning mental health. When you do they are actually talking about people who have Covid or have had Covid are experiencing depression. Like you can't have mental health issues without Covid? What kind of nonsense is that? Vaccines came out which you would think is something we should be hopeful for the news tries to scare people with ""hesitancy may stop us from going back to normal"".   


Anyways that's all I have to say. I do really hope it gets better, but lately the longer the pandemic drags on I feel it's just going to make people worse and worse. Both mentally and physically.",[deleted],344,26,2021-04-22 12:51:13,mw40z3
mentalhealth,Has anyone else noticed an increase in everyone's general anxiety in the last 3 decades?,"I may just be talking out my ass, but these days the average person seems much more anxious than they did back in the 90s. I was watching old episodes of the Red Green show, and idk what it was, but they just seemed less anxious. So many young people I talk to seem to have some form of social anxiety. I feel it in myself as well. This combination of over thinking, and almost feeling like I should be happier than I am. When watching anything from the 90s, its not that everyone is overjoyed. Theyre just comfortable. You can tell they arent over analyzing the situation, theres no fear in their eyes. Just a steadiness and easiness. Blame what you like, poor economy, the internet. I just wonder if im the only one who kinda sees it.",Yes and also we are more aware of it because society is more accepting/open to talking about it.,342,39,2021-03-25 21:42:34,md97f2

I just had music blasting through my earphones and the anger and pain which I'd always expel through punching my pillow, smoking or desperately distracting myself combined with the music somehow channeled itself into something I'd never felt before, out of the blue. All my insecurities died for a moment, chills ran through my body and I fucking danced without a care - something I never saw myself doing, ever. I was so fucking happy. I would have cried tears of joy if I hadn't stopped crying many years ago. I just had to share this :)",GET IN! Thats actually so cool.

you?","I fought all morning to keep from taking a drink and succeeded, breaking a months-long cycle of day drinking on my days off. I literally can‚Äôt believe it. My mom cried, she was so happy to see me sober during the day for the first time in recent memory.

Earlier this week she insulted me so hard I went through a big episode of panic attacks, I thought I was a bad person, I believed all her words, I went through dark thoughts.
Today I gave her the stuff she left at my house and when she claimed she was open to the discussion like I had to apologize, I walked away.

I feel so good, I feel free, I am an individual and people won‚Äôt treat me bad ever again. 

Cause I will stand up for myself, I won‚Äôt let them play with my feelings.","I‚Äôve been through something similar. Don‚Äôt look back.

mentalhealth,My cat is the biggest reason why I am sticking around,"I‚Äôve always had anxiety and big depresso my entire life. Started on meds 3 years ago, felt stabilized. But then the pandemic struck and every thing went downhill... it was like spiralling into a dark hole. 

I was never allowed to have cats growing up, although I am a huge cat lover. My parents thought they were stinky, no-good animals. At the beginning of 2021 I felt this huge void that needed to be filled by an animal. A furry companion that would give me a purpose in life to be its care-taker. To make me interested in living again. So I adopted my cat, Pepper.

My parents were absolutely livid. It was probably the worst week of my life, they were yelling at me. Telling me I just need to ‚Äúbe strong‚Äù and get over my depression. I felt like a bad person because I disobeyed their house rules. But it was getting to the point where I wanted to die really bad. My meds were upped, I started taking a new pill but the sadness still kept creeping in through the cracks. 

Sometimes I think about admitting myself to a hospital but I think about how I need to be here for him. I want the best life for my boy, he‚Äôs been spoiled with so much love, toys, treats, and a tall kitty condo. Everyday I look forward to waking up to feed him or give him pets. 

Pepper might not know it, but his existence is everything to me.

mentalhealth,I‚Äôm tired of constantly living a life I don‚Äôt enjoy,"I struggle from major depression, and I will say that it is getting better. But, I am so tired of spending all day working hard and doing things that make me miserable. I am currently in school and I have a job. I completely understand that working hard, going to school, and holding an unenjoyable retail job is all a part of being a 20 year old. 

But I am completely miserable and I don‚Äôt want to waste the years that are supposed to be the best part of my life, waking up everyday and having to do things I don‚Äôt care about. 

How do I make my everyday life more enjoyable. I want to live a life I enjoy living. But it‚Äôs also difficult to keep up with hobbies because after schoolwork and my job and dealing with the tiredness that comes from depression, I am too exhausted to keep up with hobbies. I just end up mindlessly watching tv. 

Can anyone help please?","I don't know how much longer you have in school or at your job, but it sounds like once you are able to wake up to do things you like and enjoy that will help immensely.

Now that I finally have a job and schedule that works for me things are so much better than when I was in the ""rat race"" doing things I didn't enjoy every day. One thing that helped me in those times was reserving a day or some of a day like Sundays to do anything I wanted (homework sometimes took up some of my day). 

Knowing there would be some relief in a week, a month, or a few years helped me get through the tough weeks. Find or plan something you can look forward to like a place of interest, a small staycation or vacation, visit someone you care about, or treat yourself to something.

Another tip, while mindlessly watching TV find another activity you can mindlessly do that would make you feel some sense of accomplishment. Even just 5 minutes of playing an instrument, learning a language, or doing a chore or hobby can give you a boost. A friend of mine got really into making bracelets and jewelry that doesn't take too much mental energy and is starting an Etsy to sell them.",329,34,2021-04-29 06:19:23,n0yalf

mentalhealth,I Worry About This Sub,"Day after day, night after night I scroll through my feed to catch up quick and I see so many posts on this sub, mostly genuine people looking for encouragement, empathy, or just to know they're not alone. But looking for that something, that one thing that's gonna turn their struggle around. 

Sometimes a particular post will catch my eye and I'll interact, but for the most part I watch time after time as people, mostly young people, reach out for somebody's hand and no one is there to respond. I don't view this as any one person or group of people's fault, I just think the sheer numbers of those looking for real help overwhelm the number of people qualified and/or willing enough to provide it by such a large margin that a lot of the sub continually consists of largely ignored cries for help. 

I wonder what impact this has on the greater good that all of us try to do for ourselves or other people when it comes to providing mental health care, referrals, and advice. I wonder if there's a way it could be done better by all of us involved not only with our mental health for one reason or another, but with our specific involvement in the sub. I worry about all of our brothers and sisters out there who are in a position where this Reddit sub is all they feel they have.

Don't have any answers. Would love to hear fresh ideas from anyone and everyone involved.","I try to help ignored posts as much as I can, not much you can do about it, considering I can only respond to certain types of posts that I know things about.",331,38,2021-07-25 23:21:21,ormi79

I (18NB) Was at a local Starbucks a couple hours ago and a homeless man got beaten up outside of it. Me and my dad went outside and there was blood all over the ground, a huge gash in his head, and it looked like he was beaten to a bloody pulp. I have never in my life witnessed so much blood coming out of a person. I was the only one who had the courage to go to him with some wet towels and help out with whatever he needed. He was taken away by an ambulance a few moments later. I do not know the motive but the man who beat him up and the man himself did know each other, so i don‚Äôt think it was homeless induced violence.
Nevertheless, it was an event that I have never experienced and I hope he is okay now. Any tips on how to process this event? I was desensitized in the moment but it‚Äôs all hitting me now.

I tried to reach out to get help from a doctor and they called the police because I said my life feels unlivable. So, she calls the cops, they come out and nothing changes and I don‚Äôt get help. The doctor literally passed her responsibility off onto the police. How does that help me? I tried to get into a depression clinic and their first question is about suicide. I say I don‚Äôt want to answer and they tell me that obviously I am suicidal then. So, that‚Äôs their trigger to call police.

mentalhealth,When did mental illness become a trend and edgy,"It sucks I used to be bullied so much throughout my entire childhood and most of my teenage years. For being different I liked weird stuff and never took anything seriously nothing had value. I had it become worse because everytime I tried doing better and failed it lead to things becoming worse socially. Now I go on anytime of social media and all the sudden everyone who bullied me and shit are now all some type of mentally ill all for a trend. But the fact I actually was was scoffed at by the same people. Just has me so angry like I worked so hard to try and become better and get a little stable. Then everyone else just hoped on it. It just doesn't make sense why you'd want to romanticise mental illness

Edit. I'm not trying to dismiss those who came out with mental illness it's the people who make it a trend overly self diagnose and say they have things you know for a fact they don't for a trend.","Sometimes people with genuine mental health issues take their frustrations out on people who remind them of themselves, only to later realise (when they finally grow up) that it was a terrible thing to do. It‚Äôs called projecting and it‚Äôs relatively common. Yes it is ‚Äútrendy‚Äù to be mentally ill and that pisses me off beyond belief, but not all of them are faking so be a bit careful jumping on it. Either way they were assholes for doing that to you but things were different not so long ago and maybe they were experiencing the same things in their home life. I know people who struggled with mental health and their parents didn‚Äôt believe in mental illness so they treat them like shit which, in turn, influenced their actions quite harshly.

mentalhealth,I lost it over my son's hair,"Yesterday, I noticed that my son had been chewing on a lock of his hair. No big deal lots of kids do that. I explained why he can't and that we need to trim some of his hair to deal with the damage he did to it. It was pretty torn up in one spot. His is super proud of his long hair. It was down to the middle of his back when it is wet and to his shoulders dry because of his curls. 

My mom when to beauty school years ago and offered to cut it for me. I was very hesitant because my family jokes about cutting his hair behind my back. I told her to only cut it to his shoulders but she gave him basically her hair cut which it the short old lady cut that she and my grandma have. It looks awful and I asked her to stop but she kept insisting that she needed to even it out. 

By the time she was done I was in tears. I ran out to the car to calm down so the kids didn't see me cry. My mom came out and made jokes about how I'm not speaking to her and laughed and asked if she could cut my hair next. 

I took the kids home and fed them and attempted to put his hair in his braids that I always do but it is too short. I had a full meltdown after the kids when to bed and basically hyperventilated on my kitchen floor. I'm so angry that my chest hurts and I asked my son after I was calm what he wanted to do with it and he said ""please, don't take any more of my hair."" I know I'm more upset then he is. But she just steamrolled me. She wouldn't listen.",That was kind of a bitch thing to do. I'm sorry you had to deal with that.

mentalhealth,Did my mom sexually assault me? Its not sexually motivated by it definitely felt violating.,"My mom has always been sadistic towards me. She would drag me by the hair and cut it like a maniac as some punishment then tell me how ugly i look, or she would watch me throwing up on the floor and not help cos I‚Äôm being punished. However, there are instances when i do something that ‚Äúwould dishonour‚Äù the family? She would try to strip me down infront of my own brothers, violently pulling at my clothes while i try to cover myself. One time she told me to get naked and bend over the bed so she could check if my ‚Äúhymen was intact‚Äù. 
I feel nothing but anger tbh, i normalised that behaviour from her so much that it didn‚Äôt bother me after some time, it doesn‚Äôt bother me when someone molests me in public either. I think I achieved that level of apathy and indifference by dissociation myself from my body. I consider my body as a vessel i am in, and when someone hurts or violates it, they are violating the vessel and not me personally. I do feel anger though at her and everything she put me through, so ig i feel smth. Can i call these experiences sexual abuse?



Edit: Thanks for everyone‚Äôs kind words and thanks to everyone who opened up about similar experiences. I wanted to assure everyone that i am 23 now, last time i was sexually abused by her was a couple months prior to leaving the country at 18. I don‚Äôt have to see my family for another year. I wanted to discuss this in therapy but I just couldn‚Äôt find the words to describe it ig, I didn‚Äôt know what to label it as. Now I know what to call it, i can communicate it better in therapy. 

Sadly, the idea of mental health is very undeveloped in my country and showing any signs of ‚Äúabnormality‚Äù can be dangerous. That‚Äôs why i cant call any authorities or ask anyone for help.","Yes. This is assault and abuse, sexually/physically/emotionally, as well as neglect. I am so sorry for what you have had to go through. If you can safely report her, please do so.

mentalhealth,I am furious with our mental health system!,"A child of mine admitted to me some pretty disturbing things that are going on with him mentally. I brought him to a local ""mental health urgent care"" who turned us away because our insurance wasnt one they accepted... 

Ooookay. Went to the only other one. They accept us but it has taken 7+ hours for the intake process only to be sent to a hospital to get a med eval before we can get a bed for him. Now its nearly 8 hours later and we still arent to the place with the bed for him and still just waiting and waiting. What kind of help is this? If someone were an immediate harm to themselves this is enough to drive them over the edge! I want to pull my hair out at this point!! Oh and because youre a ""risk"" they cant even turn the TV on for us at the hospital because of a ""no electronics"" rule? So theres nothing to even look at or do while we wait. 7 hours of staring at a damn wall. This is absolutely maddening. I hate this. All of this.",Sounds about right.

mentalhealth,"I started turning off and locking my phone away every weekend, and it's liberating","This may not apply to everyone. But for me, a person who is severely addicted to instagram and messaging apps, it's just really liberating. I bought this locking device that allows you to lock something in it and set a time for it to reopen (not naming any brand here, everyone please don't make this a post about products). I started out by locking my phone for a few hours, then a whole day, and eventually a whole weekend.

It is surprisingly beneficial to my mental health. I am a hypersensitive type and love to overread and overthink anything anyone say to me. And I also don't have a life. So what happen is that I need to constantly chat with my friends and family, even to the point that may annoy them, and when they show a lil bit of disinterest, even when they are really just busy, I'd literally feel hurt, it sounds so stupid to say such thing as a grown ass person, but yes, and I really hate myself for that.

Once I locked my phone, my brain will immediately try to find substitutes to generate the same stimulation, sometimes I'd use my computer to browse the internet but using the computer just never brings me the same negativity that a phone does, same as how youtube and reddit are somehow just much less toxic than ig and whatsapp to me. I don't play video games and my social circles don't use facebook anymore, so I normally can shut my computer pretty quick because I feel bored again.

And weird enough the next thing I know is that I find myself actually get up from my lazy ass and start doing things like chores, sorting mails and even doing some exercise. I don't think I am anywhere near being mentally healthy, but seriously I am much much better off without that damn phone.

Edit: Sorry guys I can't pm the brand of the device, it's against the rule, you can generally search timed locking box and anything similar will do. There are many boxes that do it.

Edit: The point of this post is really just to put your phone away, and you will instantly feel better once you can detach from the toxicity and focus on yourself.","I think that's awesome. Can you PM me the specific brand or lock that you bought? I want to try this!

(I'm curious.. if you're getting an emergency call or something, is there a way you can take your phone out from there? Let me know because I feel like this would be liberating for me too!!)",327,10,2021-04-23 14:36:23,mwwo59

I'd called police so that they could find my body and was trying to pull myself over the edge. But I couldn't do it. In that moment, I realised I didn't want to die, just that I'm severely depressed. It's been liberating ever since. I'm no longer mourning for myself or constantly thinking about suicide so I'm feeling a bit better. I've started planning for the future again which is a nice distraction from the way I feel.

Idk why I can‚Äôt do it. When I actually get far enough to open up my laptop and get the pages that I need, I just end up writing a sentence, staring at my screen for ages, and then giving up. And when I don‚Äôt get that far I literally just lay around on my phone pretending it‚Äôs not a problem.

I ""broke up"" with my eating disorder 5 days ago. I actually wrote out an entire letter to my ED and put it away. In the letter, I discussed why we were ""breaking up"" and why we should NEVER get back together again. It may sound weird, but, I think it worked. Today marks 2 weeks of my ED being gone.

My parents had been married since 1979 when mom was 18 and dad was 22.
They have 4 sons ages 41, 40, 39, and 37 and then they have me a 17 yr old daughter. 

Today a neighbor stopped by to drop cookies off to my Dad and asked him out on a dinner date. Dad looked right at me and then told her ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna have to get back to you on that one‚Äù 

Backstory on the neighbor: about a month after her husband died (like in 2016ish) she asked my Dad to come home with her one night from a bar party a bunch of the neighbors were at. Since then my Mom wasn‚Äôt a huge fan of the neighbor since she tried to convince my Dad to go home with her, and my Dad has avoided this woman like the plague because he wasn‚Äôt interested in anyone but my Mom and didn‚Äôt want to be asked again.

My parents were that couple that were still so obviously in love after so many years that anyone around them could see how they felt about one another. 

I obviously want my Dad to be happy and I would never stop him from seeing someone, but am I wrong to not feel quite ready yet to see my Dad with another women 3 months after my Mom passed?

mentalhealth,Does anyone feel frustrated being surrounded by people who don't recognize mental health is just as important as physical health?,"I (unfortunately, imo) come from a country where mental health is usually overlooked, if not completely ignored. Therapy is not available and people would say I'm making excuses for being lazy/stupid if I tell them about my mental health issues. Since I was a kid, I've always been someone who is emotional, easily triggered, easily stressed out, and tends to overthink. Everyone, even my parents, sees me as ""weak, oversensitive, and dramatic"". They don't believe one can be struggling mentally when they look just fine and ""normal"" physically. There were some critical points in my life when I got panic attacks and cried everyday, I couldn't eat or sleep and was losing weight but my parents were totally helpless (and clueless) because I didn't seem to be sick anywhere looking from the outside.

I don't blame my parents for neglecting my mental health though. They live in such conservative society and had a hard time making ends meet, so I doubt they even have time to learn about something so foreign to them.

mentalhealth,Being addicted to daydreaming (Maladaptive daydreaming),"hey um.. I recently found out about this ""disorder"" (i put it in quotes because it is not actually recognized by the DSM)

It is when people daydream very extensively for sometimes hours a day. They create their own highly structured universes and scenarios that help them cope with drama etc.

They often have the urge to that as soon as they wake up. Also while doing that a lot of people engage on repetitive movement (like pacing around). I have heard that psychologists suspect that it activates certain areas in the brain that control your imagination or might effect it in a hypnotic way (((excuse my wording i am not a native speaker lol)))

Those people do NOT gaslight themself. In fact most of MDers are able to tell which of their memories are within their paracosm/imagination and which are not.

Effects of this intense daydreaming is that people with that ""disorder"" sometimes find it very hard to focus on ANYTHING.

Some people argue that daydreaming is natural and MD should not be regarded as a mental illness. I think it certainly has characteristics of a mental illness. It is a coping mechanism at the beginning but at some point MDers find themself daydreaming all day because they got so used to living in this paracosm that they don¬¥t enjoy reality as much anymore. And this is an endless circle. Because if you don¬¥t do stuff with other people or your friends, and avoid your responsibilities and flee in your paracosm your live will get more miserable and your imagined friends, scenarios and word will look more and more appealing.

I recently found out that i might have this ""disorder"". I have stumbled across this because I had problems with not being able to live in the present. A lot of my scenarios are about my future and they are often highly fantastical. So instead of actually doing stuff that might bring me to a future that i might enjoy i just dream about already being there.

Since then i am always searching for new information on this subject and one researcher that does amazing work within this field is Eli Somer. He was the first one who recognized it and publishes a lot of videos about MD on youtube.

Here is his channel: [https://www.youtube.com/user/SomerClinic](https://www.youtube.com/user/SomerClinic)

If you have any thoughts, or further research sources please drop them here. And especially if you have experience with this subject first hand.

I just want people to know that this is real and effects people.

I'm struggling a lot with mental health. They started blaming me for not adding a disclaimer that I'm south Asian in the main post, it's not their fault for being mean to me, the majority of the users are Americans, if I need advice then I better add this in the disclaimer.
I understand that most Reddit users are American but I thought teacher-student connection is universal irrespective of nationality. I don't understand why can't people put aside their nationality. I have had great insightful conversations with lots of people on Reddit, but I occasionally receive judgemental opinions like this. Why can't people open up to others experiences, if not then at least try to be compassionate?

I told him I don't care who he loves, as long as he is happy. :) Our eldest daughter (the one graduating from college in a few weeks) is in a lesbian relationship, and I remember when she had come out to me at age 17. I said the same thing to her, and we have always been welcoming of anyone she dates.

&#x200B;

I am so proud of our daughter and son. :) Now for the 17 year old...I think he is still aromantic. He doesn't seem to be interested in anyone dating-wise. All 3 of our boys are on the Spectrum and have depression and anxiety, so I have never pushed them to ""find someone"". :) Our eldest has always been more academic than boy-crazy (or girl-crazy in her case), and I just want them to be happy--WHATEVER they end up doing...dating or not dating. :)

I just got my Top Of The Morning candle and hot chocolate in the mail, so my room smells like coffee with vanilla scent...and I feel a little better than I had before. The urge to cut has lessened a LOT, thanks to my Reddit family. :)

<3 As I said, I am forever grateful to all of you! <3

That is all for now. My cockatiel seems to think that I am ignoring her now, so I'd better go and play with her before I put her to bed for the night. :D","CONGRATULATIONS

mentalhealth,This has been the shittiest week i‚Äôve had in a long time,"Guys, my mental health has declined so quickly this week, and I just need to get this off of my chest. 

To start with some background, I suffer from anxiety and depression, and I‚Äôm in recovery for anorexia (have been for 1 1/2 years). This semester is one of my hardest ones, as I‚Äôm taking 16 credit hours in 8 weeks, and it‚Äôs made me incredibly anxious, and has made my eating disorder come back into play. I feel like I‚Äôm dying because of the weight loss and my heart pounding at all times of the day. 

My cousin got into an extremely bad car accident two weeks ago, and she‚Äôs in a coma, had broken her neck and jaw, and the doctors are extremely pessimistic about her recovering. They believe that IF she wakes up, she‚Äôll be a vegetable. This is my favourite cousin; she‚Äôs so hardworking, caring, and compassionate, and she has three kiddos all under age 5. Their dad is not in the picture, so they‚Äôve been bouncing from relative to relative, and they‚Äôre at my house currently. I‚Äôm 24, in graduate school, and have no kids of my own, so this alone has flipped my world upside down. 

Last night, I got a call from my mom that my grandfather is on hospice, and will likely pass away either this weekend or early next week. I have to figure out how I‚Äôm going to get to the funeral with the kids, manage my school work (I have two exams this weekend and finals are next week), and have to find someone to cover my shifts while I travel for the funeral. 

I just feel defeated. All of my hard work to get my anxiety and eating under control feels like it‚Äôs completely for nothing. Everything feels out of control in my life, and it feels like a runaway train that I have to catch with my bare hands. This week especially has beat me down, and I don‚Äôt know how to get back up.",What the hell. That sounds horrible. I honestly can‚Äôt even begin to imagine the amount of shit you‚Äôre going through. I feel like my problems are non existent compared to yours. Man what about the kids?? What are they going to do? Where are they going to live?,302,25,2021-03-03 22:07:52,lx5nab
mentalhealth,Is there anyone else Who is scared of phone calls?,"I have extreme anxiety for phone calls and more if its video call, I never did a video call, I used to talk to my friends when I was 7-8 years old. But everytime I talk to anyone my parents will try to listen to me. And then I need to tell my parents what I talk about and who I was talking to in details. Sometimes they also force me to on speaker while I talk with my friend so they can judge if my friends r good or bad. One time they also snatched my phone while I was talking with a friend.  
and my mom will tell me my voice is not high enough, my talking pace is not good enough, I am not being polite enough etc etc.  


So that's why I reduced calling friends and eventually totally stopped.   
i am 20 years old now & I have not talked to anyone on phone call since last 5 years except parent and one or two of my teachers. I don't even talk to my relatives or my own cousin brother and sister.  


i hardly find a good friend online bcos I have none in real life, but I lost two good friends bcos I did not talk to them on phone call. now I am about to finish my studies and I have to call and receive calls from companies regarding my internship, I am scared as fuck, Idk what to do:(((((","Hated phone calls since I was a kid.

mentalhealth,"I did it. I left the house and it almost went terribly, but I did it.","So nobody knows who I am but a few weeks ago I put up [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/oh37fp/how_to_get_out_of_the_house_without_it_seeming/) on this sub asking how to discretely go outside and what I should do (keep in mind I'm about as shut in as a shut-in gets.)

I only got 1 reply on the post, which btw, thank you u/Azarqo I meant to reply to your post but I ended up taking 3 whole weeks to push myself to find the post again. Anyway, I tried their suggestion and it worked... 50/50. By that I mean 1 part went really sour and the other actually was pretty good. Overall success, if you round up.

What happened exactly, if you read my last post I wanted to leave the house without causing my parents to worry about my mental state or wellbeing. That didn't go very well, at ALL. The moment I said ""Well you guys always say I should leave the room and go somewhere so I am now."" they immediately invited me to a talk in the living room about if I'm going out to meet someone or if there's something they should know or if I'm alright. Nope. nah. I'm good. Just... leaving... to wal-mart... yeah cuz everywhere else is closed now... no I'm alright...

I ended up inviting my brother cuz he also sits in bed all day and my Dad suggested it and me and my brother are really chill with each other. Eventually they're like ""Ok, I mean we're not stopping you, so... if there's anything you need to tell us, yknow-"" and me and my brother are out. Finally. It felt like rolling a 2 on a d20 but still succeeding (which I guess implies this was hard to screw up, but oh well)

Now the good part, we DID end up going to walmart. You may be wondering why in ALL of the places walmart? Well, I don't know a lot of places that aren't stores or places where you can walk in without some expectation of you spending money there (I mean, why else do people build buildings, eh?) My original plan was to go to the library but fun fact about the library: It just so happens on Thursdays and only Thursdays they close at 6PM instead of 9PM. And I was leaving the house later than I had initially planned to, since I spent so much time preparing and working up the nerve to tell my parents. Also we live in the middle of frick-off nowhere, and Walmart and the library are like 10-15 minute drives away from my home. There weren't many options, I tell you. (btw I found out I live there because my parents didn't want neighbors and liked the peace and quiet, which explains why we live at the end of a dead-end street and why I grew up very sheltered and very asocial.)

Walmart was fun. Especially since my brother is really into old stuff that we used to always be hyped about like nerf guns and lego. I told him I don't have anything to pay off so let's buy useless stuff, and we did. Checkout line was long as usual. No one was wearing a mask, as usual. I then remembered that Dunkin' Donuts closes at 9PM and it was almost 8, so I asked him if he wanted a donut since we have time. This is a weird bit that's unimportant to the story, but I want to bring it up anyway. We get there (literally across the street from Walmart) and we reach the doors. The employees see us, and just... leave. One dude literally tried to stand behind the computer so we wouldn't see him, even after rattling the door that has the hours printed on them. Ok... you guys just... not want anyone in here..? We end up leaving, donut-less and heartbroken... but oh well, at least I had made the effort to drive out, which I guess was the whole point.

The cool thing after that is that my parents seemed fairly cool about the situation afterword when I got home. I guess they had time to think it over while we were out as opposed to me appearing suddenly in proper clothes all like ""ah yes I've decided to go *outside* today!"" They treated me as if I had just came back from work, or turning in some checks at the bank. Just ""so what'd you guys do? Oh, cool cool"" you get the idea. My mom also looked up reviews on that dunkin' and apparently it has a reputation for bad service and willful ignorance, so ok I guess.

So, that was sure an experience that felt awkward and painful at the start, but *hopefully* I can just force it into becoming a normal thing. I plan on going to the Library next, probably by myself this time. Just to do some sketching and checking out some drawing guides and good reads. Then, they'll have no choice but to let me go back when I have to return the books. I'm telling you guys, it's the perfect plan. I'm only concerned with how my parents think about me now. They really, truly sounded concerned about me earlier, but bro I'm just trying to *do things* that normal people do everyday.

So yeah. Success.",That's awesome. I know how you feel. I used to have panic attacks just leaving the house. The way out of the cycle is just to keep doing it a little at a time. Don't be deterred if it goes badly. If it helps just walk round the block. Everyone needs excercise. It's not weird to do it.,298,17,2021-07-30 07:03:18,oufpqh

mentalhealth,"A 16 year old boy was murdered by his 'friends' 9 years ago. To this day, I still cry over it, even when everyone else has forgotten about him.","(Just to preface I have BPD and also mild OCD)

A 16 year old boy was murdered by his 'friends' 9 years ago. To this day, I still cry over it, even when everyone else has forgotten about him.

I don't know why, but this death always makes me feel IMMENSELY sad whenever I think about it. It was in Winter, the 16 year old boy was having some kind of night out with his friends. I'm not sure how long he'd known these friends, but he was seen at at a McDonald's with these friends, and wasn't seen alive again. The boy was reported as missing and a search was underway. Early the next morning, he was found in his car in the middle of nowhere, dead and half-frozen. He'd been choked to death and from what I recall it was quite violent as bruises were repeatedly mentioned.

The suspects were never charged due to insufficient evidence. None of the boy's belongings were taken and no motive was revealed. The case remains officially 'unsolved' to this day and from what I recall only one or two YouTube narrators ever mentioned the case with updates. It's like everyone just..forgot about him. His death didn't even get into the national news and it was only mentioned in a few papers.

I just think, it must've been so scary to be alone at night in the middle of nowhere with a group of three friends who seemed completely normal up until that point with him in the car with them, then they (for no apparent reason) turned on him and killed him. That's like a living nightmare. Then to add insult to injury the suspects were never charged so the kid (and his girlfriend) doesn't even have any closure.

This case kind of makes me want ghosts/spirits to not be real, because if his ghost/spirit is still wandering around, I feel like your murderers getting away with murder would be absolute torture and you still don't know why they just killed you out of the blue in a really painful slow way. If that happened to me I think I'd have a massive mental breakdown in my mind as I died.

I wish there just could have been someone walking by so they could've saved him. Then he'd still be alive.

He'd be 25 years old now. Sometimes I get reminded of his death and I cry. I imagine the terror he went through and the fear, the hopelessness, the terrified look on his face, the feeling of betrayal, how it was all dark/alone in that car, everything. For some reason he tends to come up in my dreams a lot, like I'll dream that it comes up in the newspaper that he made some miraculous recovery in the hospital, and he awoke from a coma and he's still alive. I get excited and happy, then I wake up and realize it's just a dream and he's gone.

I keep feeling his sadness, and thoughts running through his head like ''why are you doing this to me'' or ''they're killing me and nobody's around to help'' and ''is this a nightmare''. Recently I saw a video of what a body looks like at various days/years after death and by now his clothes would look all torn and he'd be mostly bones by now. I had to stop the video because it made me think about him in that state and I cried for hours. I imagine him bleeding from his eyes, nose and mouth before he died and it makes me cry.

If I ever travel to the town/state he died in, I'd make it a point to get some flowers for him and leave them at his grave.

(To the boy) even though I never knew you I hope that wherever you are right now, you're safe. I really hope you aren't suffering or in pain anymore and wherever you are, I hope you're happy.","Damn I get this. I always feel very paranoid about new people and their motives but end up putting trust in them anyway... It‚Äôs always sad when a child or anyone innocent ends up being killed in some way especially by family or friends. I hope the kid gets justice some day.

Do you feel like you are living up to your full potential? Why or why not? 

I want to know what people in their 20‚Äôs like me struggle with the most right now. Whether that is mental health, finances, school, career, purpose, etc. I want to know the gory details and hopefully create a safe place for everyone to get answers/advice and feel less alone.

Also I know people say that your 20s are the time of your life but I‚Äôve also heard people say that‚Äôs a lie. I‚Äôm starting a podcast and I want to help people out there struggling to feel less alone. This is not me asking for anyone to listen to my podcast. I genuinely want to help and see if anyone has something they wanna get off there chest! Stories and advice you would like me to mention are always welcome too. This is 100% about helping others and if you have a message to share I would love to hear it. Thank you so much

mentalhealth,"Walking behind women at night, as a man, to ease thoughts.","As men, we should be crossing over the road to make women feel as comfortable as possible at night or, hanging back a bit and giving them some space, not speeding up when they speed up or cross when they cross, this only makes women feel even more uncomfortable and puts them into a terrified state where they dont feel safe. They don't know your intentions. So to all the men on this reddit page, please, take this into account the next time you are out walking at night and see a woman infront of you.","It's so sad this is the truth, I know it's #NotAllMen, but the tragic reality is that's it's #FarTooManyMen. As a lady, this post makes me so happy. I really hope men understand that it's not YOU (well, most of you) that we are afraid of. 

(Before some ignorant A-HOLE comes along, aproximately only 5% of sexual assault reports filed have been proven false. That's EVER, not yearly.) 

WE ARE AFRAID BECAUSE:

-1 in 3  girls will be sexually assaulted by their 18th birthday.

-1 in 5 women in the US have been rapped at some point

-Most female victims of completed rape (79.6%)
 experienced their first rape before the age of 25.

-32.2% experienced their first completed rape before the age of 18 years. 

-Somewhere in America, a women is raped every 2 minutes.

-In 2019, over 652,676 women were raped. For perspective, 342,450 American's died in 2020 due to Covid-19.

‚Üë‚Üë‚Üë The above figure excludes non-rape sexual assaults; if included, this number would take the figure closer to the ONE MILLION MARK (double the US death count of Covid_19). 

-These numbers have been increasing for the last decade at an annual rate of 2.9%, and this trend shows no sign of decreasing..

Sexual assault is a pandemic that women/girls have been facing for, well, pretty much forever. 

I want to mention that female-on-male and male-on-male sexual assault and sexual violence is of course just as horrible. It's all horrible. That said, the sad reality is that being a girl/women puts one at a FAR higher risk, and that is why we are scared, cautious, always ""looking over our shoulder"" in a way that men just aren't. This is why men don't have the similar thoughts/fears/concerns when you happen to notice a women walking behind you are night. 

-82% of all juvenile victims are female

-90% of adult rape victims are female 

We really do know it's not all men, we really do. We also have to live our day to day lives with the the above realities. So, stuff like this- seeing men be aware and considerate of our (very real and valid fears) warms my heart. Thank you. Thank you to those of you who take the time to stop and think about these things and try to make behavioral changes to ease our fears a bit. Thank you to those men who spread this information, educate others. 

I also ask that men think about all the above numbers and statistics not just as how at risk women are- but realize those numbers apply to those women you are walking behind:  - 1/3 of them have already been sexually assaulted before their 18th birthday. 1/5 of those adult women have already been a rape victim (1/5 raped, imagine how startlingly higher that number is if we consider those who have been sexually assaulted in other ways). 

NOTE: The self-reported incidence of rape or sexual assault more than doubled from 1.4 victimizations per 1,000 persons age 12 or older in 2017 to 2.7 in 2018. The reality is, all those numbers above are quite likely even higher.
