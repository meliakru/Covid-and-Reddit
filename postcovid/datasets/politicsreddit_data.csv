politics,Megathread: House Votes to Impeach President Donald J. Trump for Incitement of Insurrection,"The U.S. House of Representatives voted today to impeach President Donald J. Trump for Incitement of Insurrection. The vote saw 10 Republican members of Congress vote in favor of impeachment, along with all 222 Democrats. 

This is the first time that a US President has been impeached twice during their presidency. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has stated that he does not plan on reconvening the Senate prior to January 19th, making it likely that the impeachment trial will take place during the beginning of President-elect Joseph R. Biden’s administration.

politics,"White woman who stole $250K gets probation, while Black woman who stole $40K goes to jail. Disparate sentences spark calls for reform",,"**U.S. Sentencing Commission 17**

* Black men who commit the same crimes as white men receive federal prison sentences that are, on average, nearly 20 percent longer

* The black/white sentencing disparities are being driven in large part by “non-government sponsored departures and variances”

* This means that sentencing choices are made by judges at their own discretion.

**University of Michigan Law School: Starr and Rehavi 14**

* All other factors being equal, black offenders were 75 percent more likely to face a charge carrying a mandatory minimum sentence than a white offender who committed the same crime.

**Justice Policy Institute 07**

* Whites and African Americans report using and selling drugs at similar rates, but African Americans go to prison for drug offenses at higher rates than whites

* In 2002, African Americans were admitted to prison for drug offenses at 10 times the rate of whites in the largest population counties in the country.


**Michigan State University 11**

* Found that between 1990 and 2010, state prosecutors struck about 53 percent of black people eligible for juries in criminal cases, vs. about 26 percent of white people. The study’s authors concluded that the chance of this occurring in a race-neutral process was less than 1 in 10 trillion

* Even after adjusting for excuses given by prosecutors that tend to correlate with race, the 2-to-1 discrepancy remained

* The state legislature had previously passed a law stating that death penalty defendants who could demonstrate racial bias in jury selection could have their sentences changed to life without parole. The legislature later repealed that law

**Levinson et al. 10**

* “Mock jurors” were given the same evidence from a fictional robbery case but then shown alternate security camera footage depicting either a light-skinned or dark-skinned suspect

* Jurors were more likely to evaluate ambiguous, race-neutral evidence against the dark-skinned suspect as incriminating and more likely to find the dark-skinned suspect guilty

**Johnson et al. 12**

* “Black defendants who kill white victims are seven times as likely to receive the death penalty as are black defendants who kill black victims. … Moreover, black defendants who kill white victims are more than three times as likely to be sentenced to death as are white defendants who kill white victims.”

**UNC 11**

* Murderers who kill white people are three times more likely to get the death penalty than murderers who kill black people

**Baldus et al. 04**

* “One quarter to one third of death sentenced defendants with white victims would have avoided the death penalty if their victims had been black.”

**Beckett et al. 14**

* Looking at 33 years of data found that after adjusting for variables such as the number of victims and brutality of the crimes, jurors in Washington state were 4.5 times more likely to impose the death penalty on black defendants accused of aggravated murder than on white ones

**Gross et al. 17**

* Black people are more likely to be wrongly convicted of murder when the victim was white. Only about 15 percent of people killed by black people were white, but 31 percent of black exonerees were wrongly convicted of killing white people. More generally, black people convicted of murder are 50 percent more likely to be innocent than white people convicted of murder

* Black people are 3.5 times more likely than white people to be wrongly convicted of sexual assault and 12 times more likely to be wrongly convicted of drug crimes. (And remember, data on wrongful convictions is limited in that it can only consider the wrongful convictions we know about.)

**Eberhardt et al. 06**

* This study found that when a black person was accused of killing a white person, defendants with darker skin and more “stereotypically black” features were twice as likely to receive a death sentence. When the victim was black, there was almost no difference

politics,Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner spent $100K of taxpayer money renting a bathroom so Secret Service agents didn't have to use theirs,,"> Ivanka Trump, President Donald Trump's eldest daughter, and her husband Jared Kushner, a top aide to the president, have spent about $100,000 on bathroom accommodations for their Secret Service detail after prohibiting the agents from using the bathrooms in their Washington mansion, The Washington Post reported Thursday. 

> Law enforcement officials told The Post that the president's daughter and son-in-law barred the Secret Service from using their 6.5 bathrooms when they first moved into their home in DC's wealthy Kalorama neighborhood in 2017. Instead, they offered the agents a porta-potty outside on the sidewalk.

> But after multiple neighbors complained about the porta-potty, the agents were forced to relieve themselves at a bathroom in former President Barack Obama's garage nearby, at the vice president's compound a mile up Massachusetts avenue, and at businesses in the area. 

> Finally, in September 2017, the federal government began renting a $3,000-a-month studio apartment across the street from the Trump-Kushner residence for the agents' bathroom needs.

It is such an insult to hear them sarcastically criticize the notion of $15 an hour. Let's be clear, $15 an hour at a typical 40 hour week is only $600 a week, $2,400 a month, just $31,200 a year (assuming one works every single week without any time off). That isn't a lot of money.

Why then would you allow someone to access classified/privileged information that already believes the release of it to the public is perfectly fine? 

Maybe I'm reaching with that, but it seems pretty counter-intuitive to me to allow anyone with that mindset near secret intelligence.

*edit*

First off, I didn't expect this post to take off the way it did. Holy shit lol. Thanks for the awards, and I'm glad that this post generated a lot of pretty substantive conversation on the topic. 

Reading back over it through the lens of some of these replies, I did oversimplify it a bit. Whistleblowers do have a place in government; I fully believe that, and think they're essential, last-ditch checks on corruption. However, I think there's a difference between someone who is a whistleblower, or ""leaker"" because all other options of remedying an illegal or un-Constitutional situation have been exhausted. And someone who is in government with a mindset that people ""have a right to know everything"", and due to their past affiliations might actively be on the lookout for information to release. 

Once again, that might be an oversimplication of things. But that's where I'd draw the line between someone who does something because they feel it's their patriotic duty as a last resort, and someone who does something to justify their preconceived notions and ideas.",65229,99,2021-01-22 10:28:18,l2l0eg
