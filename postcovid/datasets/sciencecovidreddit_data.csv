It's not as helpful as politicians doing their jobs, but if you want to do something that can really help these animals and all the others that live near you, plant native plants on any piece of land you can influence. Fill your yard. Tell your neighbors. Plant them at church or school or work. We need native plants everywhere. Ecosystems are built on plants. Planting native plants feeds insect that can only feed on native plants, which is most of them. Many of our native bees are need the pollen of specific native flowers to feed their young and complete their life cycle. There are 500 or so species of caterpillar that can eat oaks in north america. There are 4 species that can eat asian crepe myrtle. These insects feed other species.

science,"Teens who bully, harass, or victimize peers are often using aggression strategically to climb their school’s social hierarchy, with the highest rates of bullying occurring between friends and friends-of-friends. These findings point to reasons why most anti-bullying programs don’t work. (n>3,000)",,"A lot of teachers know about this already. Which is why being a (successful) teacher or youth activity leader is frequently a bit like being mini-machiavelli. Most often in the younger grades before they become teens (9-12) when they're easier to influence and not as good at detecting social manipulation (your social manipulation, not their own inept attempts at it).

When bullies go after someone who you subtly manipulate social dynamics to strengthen the social standing of the victim and reduce the influence of the bully. Does the bully have a hypeman? Cut away the hypeman so that they're not sitting together or working together on assignments. Raise the victims standing by pairing them up with good rolemodels that are caring but higher status. Put the hypeman, victim and a few other students in the same group so that they're more likely to become friends etc.

Ideally by the point when you reach the teenage years the class should respond to attempts at bullying by thinking that it's not cool. You might have to work for years to get to that point and it's never the same game (different moves every time to get to a preferably outcome). It will also frequently make you feel like a horrible person (or at least I frequently feel horrible when doing it). Because you're basically treating people like chesspieces, not people. And it frequently comes at a cost, because I'm going to ruthlessly exploit the peacemakers and likable persons of the class to do some of the work for me (because it's impossible to do all the work yourself. You need the weight of numbers to influence the population pool).

And always be aware that as a person in authority people are frequently nice to you without being nice persons.

I envy teachers who can do this game basically in their sleep, while still coming off as a nice persons (or ""nice but stern"") and without being emotionally drained to the point of going to sleep (and sleeping for an hour or two) the minute you get home.

What we know

1. COVID virus can enter the endothelial cells - cells that line the blood vessels supplying blood to the penis 
2. Endothelial dysfunction, typically present in men with COVID could be a common denominator for erectile dysfunction 
3. COVID19 is NOT sexually transmitted since it is absent in the semen among men who have recovered - our previous study ([https://wjmh.org/DOIx.php?id=10.5534/wjmh.200192](https://wjmh.org/DOIx.php?id=10.5534/wjmh.200192)) 

What we don't know 

1. Whether the severity of erectile dysfunction is associated with the severity of COVID 
2. The true prevalence of erectile dysfunction among COVID survivors 

What should men do 

Men who develop erectile dysfunction after COVID should discuss with their doctor if the symptoms persist to discuss treatment options since ED may be due to underlying vascular disease rather than psychological causes.

science,"Study finds that even when men and women express the same levels of physical pain, both male and female adults are more likely to think women exaggerate physical pain more than men do, displaying a significant gender bias in pain estimation that could be causing disparities in health care treatment",,"Paper Abstract:

Caregiving and other interpersonal interactions often require accurate perception of others’ pain from nonverbal cues, but perceivers may be subject to systematic biases based on gender, race, and other contextual factors. Such biases could contribute to systematic under-recognition and under-treatment of pain. In two experiments, we studied the impact of perceived patient sex on lay perceivers’ pain estimates and treatment recommendations. In Experiment 1 (N = 50), perceivers viewed facial video clips of female and male patients in chronic shoulder pain and estimated patients’ pain intensity. Multi-level linear modeling revealed that perceivers under-estimated female patients’ pain compared with male patients, after controlling for patients’ self-reported pain and pain facial expressiveness. Experiment 2 (N = 200) replicated these findings, and additionally found that 1) perceivers’ pain-related gender stereotypes, specifically beliefs about typical women's vs. men's willingness to express pain, predicted pain estimation biases; and 2) perceivers judged female patients as relatively more likely to benefit from psychotherapy, whereas male patients were judged to benefit more from pain medicine. In both experiments, the gender bias effect size was on average 2.45 points on a 0-100 pain scale. Gender biases in pain estimation may be an obstacle to effective pain care, and experimental approaches to characterizing biases, such as the one we tested here, could inform the development of interventions to reduce such biases.",67556,65,2021-03-22 12:26:48,mambuq

For small landlords, organizational informality and personal relationships with tenants make eviction a morally fraught decision.",,"Attorney here - I used to do pro bono work on behalf of indigent tenants against their landlords. 

A key consideration that seems to go unmentioned in the abstract (the article is behind a paywall), is the rise of a ""cash for keys"" culture among small-time landlords.

Large, corporate landlords have attorneys on retainer to help with evictions, as well as corporate staff to handle the matter and professional maintenance teams to take care of damaged property. They also have economies of scale that let them weather a few nonpaying tenants.

On the other hand, many large cities (like Boston), have incredibly strong tenant protections that make the eviction process fraught with risk for small-time landlords. The process can take months, small paperwork mistakes can extend this further, and angry tenants can damage the property. A small time landlord simply doesn't have the resources to deal with this.

So ""cash for keys"" has become a sort of unofficial standard option - the landlord gives you $500 (or some amount) in cash, and you give him the key and leave immediately. No eviction, no court, no record of eviction for the tenant - but also no huge risk for the small landlord. 

These cash for keys events would clearly skew the result of this paper, as they are functionally evictions, even if they're not showing up in the record.",60178,63,2021-06-20 12:25:17,o44lcy

Apparently a large amount of ADHD people suffer from it without realizing what it is.
BVD is a visual condition where the line of sight from one eye tends to be slightly out of alignment with the line of sight from the other eye (usually vertical) and this puts a heavy strain on the eye muscles as they are constantly trying to correct the alignment to achieve single focus leading to headaches, nausea, blurry vision, trouble focusing reading skipping lines, anxiety, and fear of open spaces, difficulty maintaining eye contact, bad hand-eye coordination or difficulty walking straight or drifting while walking and sleep difficulties.
 If you randomly learned that covering one eye helps you focus to read there's a good chance you need to ask an optometrist about BVD.
You can still have 20/20 vision and have BVD which is why it mostly goes undiagnosed because it's just not tested for often. This is crazy considering BVD is present in as many as 50% of children that have been diagnosed with ADHD and other learning disabilities.

Thus it forms tiny reservoirs of insulin in the blood, ready to be released in response to a sugar surge.

That is great to diabetics. However, I'm imagining all the other drugs which will need blood level monitoring, which this technology can be applied to. How about warfarin, valproate, vancomycin, and mycophenolate? If a monitoring mechanism can be built into the drug itself, the possibilities are endless.

This paper disputes the conventional view, emphasizing instead socio-economic issues and obstacles to health care access",,"Criminologist here, I studied this a bit a while ago. 

A big reason why is psychological differences in how man and women experience depression. For whatever reason, men tend to experience suicidal tendencies and depression as a long, steady, slow decline, whereas women tend to get spikes of suicidal thoughts, usually as a reaction to a real-life negative event. 

How does this translate into suicide? Men tend to think long and hard about it, and plan their suicides. They will go off and away and commit suicide, making sure they do it in a place where nobody sees them, and making sure they do it successfully. Women tend to attempt suicide (at a much higher rate, actually, they are just less successful) in acute periods of suicidal thoughts, meaning they don't plan it, and they often do it in the home where others find them, meaning they survive. 

People like to bring up 'methods', in that men use guns more. But men have higher death rates for every other type of suicide as well. 

There is a theory I read that women evolutionarily tended to commit suicide when they were in danger, whereas men tended to commit suicide when they were ashamed or dishonored.

Green policy *is* good for the economy.  Some early assumptions in the literature explain why this is counter intuitive for some.  

Early economic literature assumed that any country reducing CO2 emissions would only incur local *costs*, because any *benefits* of preventing global warming would be diluted across the entire globe.  These early assumptions influenced other academic disciplines, and formed the framework for everything from international climate negotiations to the beliefs of the layperson ([Stern 2015, section 4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4528513/)).  Economic literature has since moved on*,* but the rest of us haven’t quite caught up yet.  Current evidence suggests that **the immediate local benefits of reducing fossil fuel combustion compensate or outweigh costs**, *regardless of what other countries do.*  

While early literature focused only on CO2 emissions, fossil fuel combustion generates other pollutants which impose immediate local costs.  Among these are particulate matter (PM), nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and others.  These pollutants contribute to four of the five [leading causes](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/leading-causes-of-death.htm) of mortality in the United States[^(1)](https://www.lung.org/assets/documents/healthy-air/state-of-the-air/sota-2019-full.pdf)^(,) [^(2)](https://aqli.epic.uchicago.edu/pollution-facts/)^(,) [^(3)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27564008)^(,) [^(4)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27881237)^(,) [^(5)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26501300)^(,) [^(6)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25870974). Considering these pollutants gives us a more complete picture of the societal cost of fossil fuels ([Shindell 2015](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-015-1343-0)).  Decreasing fossil fuel use reduces these other pollutants as well, generating significant additional social co-benefits ([Barron 2018](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/pdf/10.1142/S2010007818400031)).  

[Scovronick 2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-09499-x#Abs1) finds that “The optimal climate policy (carbon pricing) has immediate and continual monetized global net benefits when accounting for health co-benefits. This overturns the findings from standard cost-benefit optimization models, which ignore health co-benefits and thus imply that optimal climate policy has net costs for much of this century.”  [Vandyck 2018](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-06885-9) ([fig. 6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-06885-9/figures/6)) finds that the co-benefits of unilaterally reducing fossil fuel use exceed costs in most countries, even without accounting for benefits of avoiding climate damages.  Other recent research comes to similar conclusions ([Barron 2018](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/pdf/10.1142/S2010007818400031), [Stern 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4528513/), [Shindell 2018](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-018-0108-y))

When accounting for [health](https://nicholas.duke.edu/sites/default/files/documents/Shindell_Testimony_July2020_final.pdf) and climate benefits, reducing emissions on a 2**°**C pathway would result in a net benefit of nearly $1 trillion per year in the US.

science,Scientists develop ‘cheap and easy’ method to extract lithium from seawater,,">***ABSTRACT***
>
>Seawater contains significantly larger quantities of lithium than is found on land, thereby providing an almost unlimited resource of lithium for meeting the rapid growth in demand for lithium batteries. However, lithium extraction from seawater is exceptionally challenging because of its low concentration (∼0.1–0.2 ppm) and an abundance of interfering ions. Herein, we creatively employed a solid-state electrolyte membrane, and design a continuous electrically-driven membrane process, which successfully enriches lithium from seawater samples of the Red Sea by 43 000 times (i.e., from 0.21 to 9013.43 ppm) with a nominal Li/Mg selectivity >45 million. Lithium phosphate with a purity of 99.94% was precipitated directly from the enriched solution, thereby meeting the purity requirements for application in the lithium battery industry. Furthermore, a preliminary economic analysis shows that the process can be made profitable when coupled with the Chlor-alkali industry.

> 
> Martin and her colleagues offer a few reasons why CBD may have been associated with reductions in anxiety in the long-term, but not at baseline. It could be that those who reported using cannabis products at baseline had developed a tolerance to its anxiety-reducing effects.

This is somewhat paradoxical, and suggests the mechanism might not be related to its immediate psychological effects.

According to a new survey, half of U.S. adults who are still unwilling to get the coronavirus vaccine say there is nothing anyone can do to change their minds.

In a nationwide poll of more than 6,000 American adults, an international team of researchers found that the main reason revolves around fears that the COVID-19 vaccine is unsafe.
