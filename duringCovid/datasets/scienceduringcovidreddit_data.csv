They write that they gave a low dose (n=36), medium dose (n=36) and a high dose (n=36). Is there any reason they didn't use a control group that were given an injection without any active ingredients?
Second question - There was no mention of the person administering the injection not being aware of which dose they were giving the recipient. I thought this was common practice to prevent any undue influence on the results. Would they have done this as standard (which is why it's not explicitly mentioned)? Or did they not do this and is there a valid reason for that?

> How do birds achieve impressive cognitive prowess with walnut-sized brains? We investigated the cellular composition of the brains of 28 avian species, uncovering a straightforward solution to the puzzle: brains of songbirds and parrots contain very large numbers of neurons, at neuronal densities considerably exceeding those found in mammals. Because these “extra” neurons are predominantly located in the forebrain, **large parrots and corvids have the same or greater forebrain neuron counts as monkeys with much larger brains**. Avian brains thus have the potential to provide much higher “cognitive power” per unit mass than do mammalian brains.

science,"Water has been definitively found on the Moon, Nasa has said",,"Astronomer here!  Here is what is going on!

**Didn't we already know there was water on the moon?** Short answer: yes.  Water on the moon in the form of ice has been known for decades, but in very specific circumstances of some craters in the south pole that never get sunlight.  The trick is the daytime temperatures on the moon (remember, a day lasts two weeks there- as in, sunrise to sunset) reaches above the boiling temperature of water, so until now it was thought the water outside these regions would have evaporated long ago.

**What's new this time?** Scientists used a cool instrument called SOFIA, the world's only flying observatory, which is a telescope on a modified Boeing 747 and flies above 99% of the water vapor in the atmosphere and thus can make this measurement even though you can't from Earth's surface. (Full disclosure, one of the coolest things I've done was get to ride on SOFIA last year, as far south as Antarctica!  I wrote about it [here](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/riding-along-with-a-stratospheric-telescope/) if you're interested in what it's like.) They basically demonstrated using its unique observation capabilities that water is also present in the sunny areas, not just the southern craters, so will hopefully be way easier for future astronauts to access.  SOFIA is basically capable of mapping the molecular existence of water at [Clavius crater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clavius_\(crater\)) (fun coincidence: where they had the lunar base in *2001: A Space Odyssey*!), and found it a lot of those sunlit places where no one was really expecting it.  It's also not literally water droplets or chunks of ice, mind, but a fairly low concentration, likely from micro-meteorites or the solar wind- they say it's the *equivalent of a 12 oz bottle over a cubic meter of soil*, and NASA on the press conference right now can't confirm how useful that'll be and how prevalent this is all over.

**What gives?  Is this that big a deal if we already knew there is water?** I mean, on the one hand, yes.  Water is obviously super important for future explorations and is really expensive to send up, so it'll be really useful for future lunar astronauts if it's more accessible.  Also, it is intriguing in terms of how prevalent water might be in other areas in space that are currently thought to be harsh environments incapable of having it.  On the other hand... this is my personal opinion, but NASA *does* like to sometimes get a splash in the press because they are a government agency that is currently looking at a lot of budget cuts for a lot of their science. Specifically, SOFIA [was canceled in the most recent proposed NASA budget](https://spacenews.com/nasas-sofia-airborne-observatory-faces-termination-again/), and it's not a cheap instrument. (I actually had a random astronomer I've never met chastising me for my article about how cool SOFIA was last year, which was weird, so this is a not-insignificant sentiment.) Obviously, a lot of scientists really disagree with this assessment of how important SOFIA is, as it's the best way to do infrared astronomy right now that we have, so it's good to have a press conference that will inevitably have a bit more press coverage than just a press release to highlight the cool things only SOFIA can do.

science,Hints of life spotted on Venus: researchers have found a possible biomarker on the planet's clouds,,"Astronomer here!  Here is what is going on!

For many years, astronomers have speculated that the most likely way to find evidence of extraterrestrial life is via [biosignatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosignature), which are basically substances that provide evidence of life.  Probably the most famous example of this would be oxygen- it rapidly oxidizes in just a few thousand years, so to have large quantities of oxygen in an atmosphere you need something to constantly be putting it there (in Earth's case, from photoplankton and trees).  Another one that's been suggested as a great biosignature is [phosphine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphine)- a gas we can only make on Earth in the lab, or via organic matter decomposing (typically in a water-rich environment, which Venus is not).  So, to be abundantly clear, the argument here is to the best of our knowledge you should *only* get this concentration of phosphine if there is life.

***What did this group discover?  Is the signal legit?*** These scientists basically pointed [a submillimeter radio telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell_Telescope) towards Venus to look for a signature of phosphine, which was not even a very technologically advanced radio telescope for this sort of thing, but they just wanted to get a good benchmark for future observations.  And... they found a phosphine signature.  They then pointed another, better radio telescope at it ([ALMA](https://public.nrao.edu/telescopes/alma/)- hands down best in the world for this kind of observation) and measured this signal even better.  I am a radio astronomer myself, and looking at [the paper]( https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-020-1174-4), I have no reason to think this is *not* the signature from phosphine they say it is.  They spend a lot of time estimating other contaminants they might be picking up, such as sulfur dioxide, but honestly those are really small compared to the phosphine signal.  There's also a lot on the instrumentation, but they do seem to understand and have considered all possible effects there.

***Can this phosphine be created by non-life?*** The authors also basically spend half the paper going through allllll the different possible ways to get phosphine in the atmosphere of Venus.  If you go check ""extended data Figure 10"" in the paper they go through all of the options, from potential volcanic activity to being brought in from meteorites to lightning... and all those methods are either impossible in this case, or would not produce you the concentration levels needed to explain the signature by several orders of magnitude (like, literally a million times too little).  As I said, these guys were very thorough, and brought on a lot of experts in other fields to do this legwork to rule options out!  And the only thing they have not been able to rule out so far is the most fantastic option. :) The point is, *either we don’t get something basic about rocky planets, or life is putting this up there.*

(Mind, the way science goes I am sure by end of the week someone will have thought up an idea on how to explain phosphine in Venus's atmosphere.  Whether that idea is a *good* one remains to be seen.)

To give one example, It should be noted at this point that phosphine has apparently been detected in comets- specifically, it’s thought to be behind in the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko by the Rosetta mission- [paper link]( https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/5/e1600285).  Comets have long been known to have a ton of organic compounds and are water rich- some suggest life on Earth was seeded by comets a long time ago- but it’s *also* present in the coma of comets as they are near the sun, which are *very* different conditions than the Venusian atmosphere. (It’s basically water ice sublimating as it warms up in a comet, so an active process is occurring in a water-rich environment to create phosphine.) However, the amounts created are nowhere near what is needed for the amounts of phosphine seen in Venus, we do not have water anywhere near the levels on Venus to make these amounts of phosphine, and we have detailed radar mapping to show us there was no recent cometary impact of Venus.  As such, it appears highly unlikely that what puts phospine into Venus’s atmosphere is the same as what puts it into a comet’s coma.  [Research into this also indicates that, surprise surprise, cometary environments are very different than rocky ones, and only life can put it in the atmosphere of a rocky planet.]( http://www.sci-news.com/astronomy/phosphine-biosignature-gas-07957.html
)

***How can life exist on Venus?  I thought it was a hell hole!*** The surface of Venus is indeed not a nice place to live- a runaway greenhouse effect means the surface is hot enough to melt lead, it rains sulfuric acid, and the Russian probes that landed there in didn't last more than a few hours. (No one has bothered since the 1980s.) However, if you go about 50 km up Venus's atmosphere is the most Earth-like there is in the Solar System, and this is where this signal is located. What's more, unlike the crushing pressure and hot temperatures on the surface, you have the same atmospheric pressure as on Earth, temps varying from 0-50 C, and pretty similar gravity to here.  [People have suggested we could even build cloud cities there.](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20161019-the-amazing-cloud-cities-we-could-build-on-venus) And this is the region this biosignature is coming from- not the surface, but tens of km up in the pretty darn nice area to float around in.

Plus, honestly, you know what I’m happy about that will come out of this?  More space exploration of Venus!  It is a fascinating planet that is criminally under-studied despite arguably some of the most interesting geology and atmosphere there is that we know of. (My favorite- Venus’s day is longer than its year, and it rotates “backwards” compared to all the other planets.  But we think that’s not because of the way it formed, but because some gigantic planet-sized object hit it in the early days and basically flipped it upside down and slowed its spin.  Isn’t that so cool?!) But we just wrote it off because the surface is really tough with old Soviet technology, and NASA hasn’t even sent a dedicated mission in over 30 years despite it being *literally the closest planet to us*.  I imagine that is going to change *fast* and I am really excited for it- bring on the Venus drones!

[***So, aliens?***](https://media.giphy.com/media/RluM0kvZXkLS0/giphy.gif) I mean, personally if you're asking my opinion as a scientist... I think I will always remember this discovery as the first step in learning how common life is in the universe. :) To be clear, the ""problem"" with a biosignature is it does *not* tell you what is putting that phosphine into the Venusian atmosphere- something microbial seems a good bet (we have great radar mapping of Venus and there are def no cloud cities or large artificial structures), but as to what, your guess is as good as mine.  We do know that [billions of microbes live high up in the Earth's atmosphere](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2013/01/microbes-survive-and-maybe-thrive-high-atmosphere), feeding as they pass through clouds and found as high as 10km up.  So I see no reason the same can't be happening on Venus! (It would be life still pretty darn ok with sulfuric acid clouds everywhere, mind, but we have extremophiles on Earth in crazy environments too so I can’t think of a good reason why it’s *impossible*).

If you want to know where the smoking gun is, well here's the thing... Hollywood has well trained you to think otherwise, but I have always argued that discovering life elsewhere in the universe was going to be like discovering water on Mars.  Where, as you might recall, first there were some signatures that there was water on Mars but that wasn't conclusive on its own that it existed, then a little more evidence came in, and some more... and finally today, everyone knows there is water on Mars.  There was no reason to think the discovery of life wouldn't play out the same, because that's how science operates. (This is also why I always thought people were far too simplistic in assuming we would all just drop everything and unite as one just because life was discovered elsewhere- there'd be no smoking gun, and we'd all do what we all are doing now, get on social media to chat about it.) But put it this way- today we have taken a really big first step.  And I think it is *so amazing* that this was first discovered not only next door, but on a planet not really thought of as great for life- it shows there's a good chance life in some for is ubiquitous!  And I for one cannot wait until we can get a drone of some sort into the Venusian atmosphere to measure this better- provided, of course, we can do it in a way that ensures our own microbes don't hitch a ride.

TL;DR- if you count microbes, which I do, we are (probably) not alone. :D

Edit: There will be a Reddit AMA Wednesday at noon EDT from the team at /r/askscience!

**Edit 2: A lot of questions about whether this could just be from bacteria that hitched a ride on our old probes.  The short answer is that's not really possible at the levels detected.  Life as we have it on Earth can't survive on Venus because of all the sulfuric acid clouds and such.  Even if something managed to do so, bacteria don't reproduce as fast as would be needed to explain this signal.**",70968,49,2020-09-14 15:00:04,ismhzh

Researchers at KU Leuven have now discovered that administering oxytocin to adult men with autism makes them more open to close emotional bonds with others. The hormone has positive long-term effects as well. 

A team led by Professor Kaat Alaerts (KU Leuven) recruited 40 adult men with autism spectrum disorder to take part in their study. 

“In a first stage, we examined the amount of oxytocin produced by the participants themselves. The subjects also filled out several questionnaires,” Professor Alaerts explains. “An analysis of the data revealed that the amount of oxytocin found in the subjects’ saliva was inversely related to their self-reported attachment issues.”

In a second stage of the research, the team examined the long-term effects of administering oxytocin through a nasal spray. This experiment produced remarkable results: the participants who had been given oxytocin for four weeks experienced positive effects until up to a year later.

Less repetition, more attachment
“We divided the 40 participants into an experimental group and a control group. The control group received a placebo for four weeks,” says doctoral student Sylvie Bernaerts, who is the first author of the study in Molecular Autism.

Findings come from a nationwide representative sample of more than 61,000 participants",,"it is important to note that there was a recent study that showed some proportion of asymptomatic positives lost serum antibodies within months. The implications of this is not yet fully clear. It needs to be noted that what is most critical for sustained immunity is NOT circulating antibodies, but trained memory T cells that can react to infection, and subsequently stimulated the production of neutralizing antibodies.

a recent publication showed that some asymptomatic positives that were seronegative still had sars-cov-2 reactive t cells

The number of suicides and overdoses I've seen this year, especially among young people, has been off the charts.  

I work in organ transplant and the increase in organ offers since the lock down started has been overwhelming.  

To give you some numbers, I got 10 organ offers a day on average in Sept. 2019 and 21 a day on average in 2020.  October was not quite as bad with an average increase of about 150% over the previous Oct.  

Overall the number of organ offers increased 7% from April to the end of November this year over last.  We did have almost a moratorium on organ donors for about the first month as people came to terms with what to do and how best to operate with covid.  

We have run out of lung recipients a number of times with all the transplants we have been doing and one of my centers transplanted 5 hearts already this week.  

I know that the local OPO usually has about 200 organ donors a year and this year they are on schedule to have about 300.

If you have a small tumour, well-connected to the blood stream, the cells will die at a higher rate.  That higher rate of cell death, via apoptosis or necrosis will increase the levels of cell-free DNA in your blood plasma.  That's the first sign.  Then if you create a targetted panel of genes to cancer, you can match up your cell-free DNA to detect mutations being given off.

A preliminary map of Falerii Novi, an ancient Roman city located 31 miles north of Rome, has been compiled with data taken from ground-penetrating radar. It’s “preliminary” because it wasn’t humanly possible for the researchers to fully analyse the 28 billion data points collected during the course of the project, explained Martin Millett, a co-author of the study and an archaeologist at the University of Cambridge, to Gizmodo

The researchers were able to document the locations of buildings, monuments, passageways, and even water pipes – all without having to pick up a single hand trowel. In addition to documenting these previously unknown architectural features, the scientists were able to chronicle changes to the city over time and discern unique elements not seen elsewhere in ancient Rome. The new research was published today in the scientific journal Antiquity.

Falerii Novi is well documented in historical accounts, representing just one of roughly 2,000 cities across the Roman Empire. It first appeared in 241 BCE and was occupied until the Medieval period, when it was finally abandoned around 700 CE.

science,Tackling climate change seemed expensive. Then COVID happened. | the money countries have put on the table to address COVID-19 far outstrips the low-carbon investments that scientists say are needed in the next five years to avoid climate catastrophe — by about an order of magnitude.,,"We tend to talk about climate mitigation in terms of ***cost***, which is an outdated way of thinking.  Early economic literature assumed that any country reducing CO2 emissions would only incur local *costs*, because any benefits of preventing global warming would be *delayed and global*.  These early assumptions influenced other academic disciplines, and formed the framework for everything from international climate negotiations to the beliefs of the layperson ([Stern 2015, section 4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4528513/)).  But current evidence suggests that **the** ***immediate*** **and** ***local*** **benefits of reducing fossil fuel combustion outweigh costs**, regardless of what other countries do*.*  

While early literature focused only on CO2 emissions, fossil fuel combustion generates other pollutants which impose immediate local costs.  Among these are particulate matter (PM), nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and others.  These pollutants contribute to four of the five leading causes of mortality in the United States. Considering these pollutants gives us a more complete picture of the societal cost of fossil fuels ([Shindell 2015](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-015-1343-0)).  Decreasing fossil fuel use reduces these other pollutants as well, generating significant additional social co-benefits ([Barron 2018](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/pdf/10.1142/S2010007818400031)).  

[Scovronick 2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-09499-x#Abs1) finds that “The optimal climate policy has immediate and continual monetized global net benefits when accounting for health co-benefits. This overturns the findings from standard cost-benefit optimization models, which ignore health co-benefits and thus imply that optimal climate policy has net costs for much of this century.”  [Vandyck 2018](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-06885-9) ([fig. 6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-06885-9/figures/6)) finds that the co-benefits of unilaterally reducing fossil fuel use exceed costs in most countries, even without accounting for benefits of avoiding climate damages.

science,A study conducted by Hiroshima University researchers found that using Ultraviolet C light with a wavelength of 222 nanometers which is safer to use around humans effectively kills SARS-CoV-2 -- the first research in the world to prove its efficacy against the virus that causes COVID-19.,,"A study conducted by Hiroshima University researchers found that using Ultraviolet C light with a wavelength of 222 nanometers which is safer to use around humans effectively kills SARS-CoV-2 — the first research in the world to prove its efficacy against the virus that causes COVID-19.

Other studies involving 222 nm UVC, also known as Far-UVC, have so far only looked at its potency in eradicating seasonal coronaviruses that are structurally similar to the SARS-CoV-2 but not on the COVID-19-causing virus itself. A nanometer is equivalent to one billionth of a meter.

An in vitro experiment by HU researchers showed that 99.7% of the SARS-CoV-2 viral culture was killed after a 30-second exposure to 222 nm UVC irradiation at 0.1 mW/cm2. The study is published in the American Journal of Infection Control.

Tests were conducted using Ushio’s Care222TM krypton-chloride excimer lamp. A 100 microliter solution containing the virus (ca. 5 × 106 TCID50/mL) was spread onto a 9-centimeter sterile polystyrene plate. The researchers allowed it to dry in a biosafety cabinet at room temperature before placing the Far-UVC lamp 24 centimeters above the surface of the plates.

222 nm vs 254 nm UVC

A wavelength of 222 nm UVC cannot penetrate the outer, non-living layer of the human eye and skin so it won’t cause harm to the living cells beneath. This makes it a safer but equally potent alternative to the more damaging 254 nm UVC germicidal lamps increasingly used in disinfecting healthcare facilities

Bought a house here two years ago, had a baby 7 weeks ago. I spend every bit of spare time I can in the marsh around here (sometimes near Lafitte).

The situation here is worse than people think. For me to leave my residence in New Orleans to get to Hopedale (a popular fishing spot), I pass through three different levee systems. I sometimes also see [The Great Wall of Chalmette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IHNC_Lake_Borgne_Surge_Barrier) on my way out. These systems are protecting New Orleans from a flood similar to Katrina. It is an insane amount of human resources that went into this.

Lafitte is on the other side of the river. The ""west bank."" That didn't flood during Katrina and most folks in the urban part of the west bank think of it as much more secure than the east bank.

I even fall into that mindset.

But it's wrong. The marsh is eroding fast enough that there are islands that I've come to learn just in the last two years that are gone. There are so many places from when I was a kid that are just totally gone.

People in the city are so exasperated and exhausted of thinking about protecting the marsh they say ""to hell with it"" not understanding that's what protects us. People in the marsh don't want to do anything because some of our best ideas (like river diversions) might kill their oysters, or ruin redfish/trout fishing. Oil companies aren't being held to account because so many people are employed by them.

I type all of this to say that I honestly feel like I'm racing against time to show my child a life and lifestyle that I was fortunate to have that she may not. I literally hope I can just have a few good years to show her what a beautiful ecosystem we have before we are forced to be climate refugees ourselves.

It's a bizarre feeling.

Edit -

I have to turn off replies for this. One thing worth mentioning and it's the ""why did you buy/why don't you move"" crowd. First, I bought because my mortgage is cheaper than renting, and because New Orleans isn't going anywhere in the next 30 years. Second, I don't move because this is where I live and where I'm from. In the last decade, the entire gulf coast has flooded or had a massive hurricane. The eastern coast is also experiencing coastal loss and hurricanes (and flooding). The western coast is also experiencing coastal loss and flooding (not to mention forest fires and massive droughts).

“The stay-at-home orders did result in one major health positive. Overall, healthy eating increased because we ate out less frequently. However, we snacked more. We got less exercise. We went to bed later and slept more poorly. Our anxiety levels doubled,” said Leanne Redman, PhD, Associate Executive Director for Scientific Education at Pennington Biomedical Research Center.

The global survey evaluated the inadvertent changes in health behaviors that took place under the pandemic’s widespread restrictions. Researchers found that the lockdown’s effects were magnified among people with obesity.

“Overall, people with obesity improved their diets the most. But they also experienced the sharpest declines in mental health and the highest incidence of weight gain,” Dr. Redman said. “One-third of people with obesity gained weight during the lockdown, compared to 20.5 percent of people with normal weight or overweight.”

science,"Study: ""Autistic burnout is a syndrome conceptualized as resulting from chronic life stress and a mismatch of expectations and abilities without adequate supports. It is characterized by pervasive, long-term (typically 3+ months) exhaustion, loss of function, and reduced tolerance to stimulus""",,"Psychiatrist here. 

Edit/Disclaimer: Autistic burnout is an important and specific condition and the OP paper describes the myriad of ways it differs from other forms of burnout. My intent with the post below is not to say autistic burnout isn’t important or different than other forms of burnout, but merely to educate people that other forms of burnout do exist, and can co-exist with most any chronic condition that affects people over time. 

Burnout doesn’t just happen with autism, although autistic burnout has specific symptoms that differentiate it from other types of burnout, which will tend to have their own other specific symptoms. Burnout can happen with any chronic condition that impacts a person’s function and life satisfaction. In mental health, we see burnout with autism, ADHD, depression, anxiety, OCD, most every chronic condition that we treat. Again, autistic burnout will be different from ADHD burnout, but many conditions can cause burnout. I’ve also seen it with chronic “medical” conditions like obesity, diabetes, asthma, severe allergies, heart problems, and so on. 

If you have an condition that makes it stressful to do what you need to do to get by in life and be happy, then you’re going to burn out, but how that burnout presents can vary greatly. Burnout (of any type) is not a well defined condition, so papers like the one posted here are extremely helpful in delineating how people with autism experience burnout, which may differ from how others experience it.",46552,75,2020-06-07 12:13:17,gyb96a

When there’s a public health crisis or disaster like the coronavirus pandemic, experts know that the official death tally is going to be an undercount by some extent. Some people who die might never have been tested for the disease, for example, and if people die at home without receiving medical care, they might not make it into the confirmed data.

To address that, researchers often look to what are called excess deaths — the number of deaths overall during a particular period of time compared to how many people die during the stretch in a normal year.

Now, in the most [updated count to date](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6942e2.htm?s_cid=mm6942e2_w), researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have found that nearly 300,000 more people in the United States died from late January to early October this year compared the average number of people who died in recent years. Just two-thirds of those deaths were counted as Covid-19 fatalities, highlighting how the official U.S. death count — now standing at about 220,000 — is not fully inclusive.",45711,61,2020-10-20 18:59:36,jew56o
