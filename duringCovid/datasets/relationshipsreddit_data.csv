So yesterday he took me to run errands but he ""randomly"" decided to we should just have fun instead. He took me around the city, we tried all kinds of food, had honestly the most fun I've had since I was a kid, made memories off of little moments, I didn't think that much of it. I realized that the whole day had basically been an all day-date, I knew it had to be coming and I had the ring with me and I was going to try and propose at the same time (someone suggested this in my original post and I thought it would be cute) 

He opened my door, walked me down a beautiful pathway and just looked me in the eyes and I said yes. He laughed and dropped down to one knee and I started crying and forgot that I was supposed to be proposing too. I don't even remember what he said, he was on his knee for a while saying what I'm sure were the sweetest things, but I was too busy crying. I'd already said yes before he even got down on one knee so he put the ring on my finger.

We went home and and I realized I didn't propose, he wanted to shower and we sometimes shower together so I proposed to him in there. He smiled and said ‚ÄúI wonder if when our first kid is born will it top this moment‚Äù then because I was on my knees in the shower he had to make a sex joke üòÇ

After we got out he held me while we called his parents (I'd already called my whole family in car ride home) 

Yesterday was amazing and now I'm laying next to him while he plays video games and he's talking about our engagement to his friends and I couldn't be happier and I don't know how to contain all this and just ugh! I love you Nathan!‚ù§Ô∏è

Edit: Thank you to everyone congratulating us! I appreciate it very much üòä

TL;DR: He took me on a romantic all day date and popped the question. I was supposed to propose at the same time but was too busy crying form happiness, I proposed to him in the shower when we got homeüòÇ I'm overjoyed right now!","Congratulations! Sounds like a beautiful day, very happy for you both!",10883,194,2020-02-26 14:54:57,f9ue25
relationships,UPDATE: I (34F) feel unattractive and my husband (41M) of 5 years has low libido,"I posted last summer about [struggles with my husband of 5 years](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/c96jun/i_34f_feel_unattractive_and_my_husband_41m_of_5/), our longest dry spell being 9 months.

I felt unattractive and undesirable, and wanted to have sex more often, but he was happy to never have sex again (aside from how that would affect me). I wanted to feel like a sex Goddess again. Reddit advised me all kinds of things, from checking testosterone, to therapy, and even that there was no hope and if I wanted to feel like a Goddess again, I'd have to leave him. The [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/c96jun/i_34f_feel_unattractive_and_my_husband_41m_of_5/estjlke?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) that hit me hardest was jimmyjrdanceparty's who pointed out that I was allowed to feel the way I did.

Well, I feel like a Goddess again, everyone! :D

What happened? I decided to go to individual therapy, and focus on myself, work on myself. My physical self-image was a symptom of a larger problem. Troubles at work, troubles at home, a storm inside. During counselling, I opened the door to a cellar where I had been keeping my true self locked in the dark - ashamed of her. I was bullied as a kid, and I had no idea I had accumulated so much self-loathing since then. Releasing that was amazing and so freeing!

And so, by the time I said goodbye to my counsellor, I was stronger and more self-assured. I realised I had been sacrificing so much of myself for the sake of others (especially the important men in my life - my husband, my boss, my father, my manager, etc). I was constantly seeking approval, trying to please them. My relationships had gotten completely out of balance.

Things started to get complicated. I developed a crush on a colleague, and because I am demisexual, my attraction to my husband started to diminish. The more time passed the more I felt like I just didn't care anymore what he thought of me.

At a low point, I said to my husband: ""You know, you always keep your thoughts to yourself. I used to find it mysterious and interesting - like a puzzle I could unwrap. But now I realise that there's actually no mystery to unravel. There's just nothing. And the silence is boring."" It was hurtful and unkind. I'm not proud of it. Something changed after that. Both for him, and for me.

Over the course of the next few months I gave less, and I took more. I went to conferences, I left the kids with my husband, I took time off work, I stopped making up for the mistakes of my superiors at work and let them deal with the consequences of their actions. I felt like I was coming home to my true self - my no nonsense kickass self.

One night my husband and I were watching Alien, and he confessed that ever since he'd seen the original as a boy, he'd really liked Ripley. She was the kind of woman he had wanted to marry. And so he married me. You should've seen my face, the tears wouldn't stop. I felt like he had finally told me what I needed to hear the most.

I got rid of my attraction to my colleague. It's actually not that hard as a demi, I just focused on everything I didn't like about them, and within a week or two the crush was totally gone. I find them a total turn-off now.

Do you remember I mention I wasn't able to initiate sex? That's because it was a huge turn-off for my husband. One evening we discussed why, and you know what? He felt too much pressure if I initiated, because he thought he'd have to perform. Once he realised that he can safely turn me down if he's not in the mood - and also that's it's OK for us to kiss and cuddle without it leading to something more - he's been OK with me initiating. You'd think you wouldn't get to age 40 without having figured that out, but hey... I guess people never cease to throw surprises!? Haha!

Our sex life improved a lot. I no longer needed his praise to sooth my self-loathing, so I was less needy about it. He initiated a bit more often. But more importantly, with greater enthusiasm and quality! He chooses what I wear sometimes - and I feel so beautiful when he looks at me like I am the only being that matters. And he compliments me! We even got into a bit of light D/s, which has spiced things up a lot!

Even though I had fallen out of love with him for a while, I have fallen back in love with my husband stronger and harder than ever before!! I couldn't be happier, I love myself, and I love him so SO much!! He's just the best partner I could ever wish for! <3

Thank you reddit for helping me through one of the hardest lows in my life, and thank you especially jimmyjrdanceparty for your advice and encouragement.

TLDR: I felt unattractive and my husband didn't want sex. I went to a counsellor. I stopped self-loathing. Husband and I fell back in love again & have great sex.

Update: OMG thank you thank you thank you for all the comments and awards! I have no words! I thought maybe 5 people would care about the update, not this amazing amount of encouragement! Thank you so much, so glad to have been on this journey with you. <3","This is the best post I have ever read on here. You changed your thoughts about yourself, which is the secret to life (IMO).

relationships,Update: My(M26) wife(F26) is not happy,"Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/hm1wdi/mym26_wifef26_isnt_happy/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

Thank you everyone for the advice from the original post. I just wanted to give the community an update. My wife finally got back yesterday from leaving to go see her sister. We talked for a little bit yesterday, but still came to the same thing she has been telling me. She doesn‚Äôt want to be with me because she doesn‚Äôt feel in love, emotionally connected, or intimate towards me. She views me as a friend. I told her she needed to choose either we work on this and go to counseling or it‚Äôs a divorce and we cut ties. She couldn‚Äôt decide and said to give her the weekend. 

This morning I woke up early, made her breakfast and brought it to her in bed. Then took her out to eat for lunch and desert trying to just spark anything to see if she would agree to work on it. Well we sat down again after getting back and she said she wanted a divorce and she was 100% on that. 

It was tough. A lot of crying, sadness, hurt, and all the emotions one would feel. I ended up just going to my room and she left for the night. I decided to get out and do something so I jogged and listed to some music for a bit. It helped. 

I came to the realization that we all have such little time on earth and I don‚Äôt want to waste it moping around. I want to improve myself physically, emotionally, and mentally. I want to just enjoy life and find myself again. So I‚Äôm going to do that and one day I might meet someone who is perfect to continue the journey of life with me. 

So I‚Äôm still sad and hurt, but all that to say I‚Äôm moving forward and trying to be positive. Thank you all for your support.

tl;dr Wife wants a divorce. I‚Äôm trying to stay positive and move one.","The end of a relationship is hard but it‚Äôs also such a great opportunity for growth, self compassion, and fun. The initial part of the separation is hard but just know that you will be okay, slowly things will get better. 
You‚Äôre still so young, you‚Äôre going to find someone that‚Äôs a better match for you. Just give yourself time to grieve and take care of yourself. When my bf and I broke up I listened to ‚ÄúBreakup Recover Podcast‚Äù by Barbara Stevens, she‚Äôs so calming and has a way of making you feel cared for and safe. There were days where I felt like shit but I would force myself to listen to it and I never regretted it. 
Hope you find happiness within yourself soon!",8123,179,2020-07-26 03:33:33,hxzwcl
relationships,UPDATE: My [F27] flatmate [F27] has told my boyfriend [M31] she's in love with him.,"You can read the original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/hczgd8/my_f27_flatmate_f27_has_told_my_boyfriend_m31/).

Okay! Firstly, thank you all for your advice (and **no thank you**) to the few who took it upon themselves to DM me to be inappropriate or creepy - wtf, read the room).

It gets a little intense, so first I'll just cover some things I wasn't able to in my original post.

I trust my boyfriend completely. Even if I didn't, this apartment is large, not massive....I know where that beloved MF is 24/7. A lot of you asked when after my housemates confession he told me about it: he  told me a couple of hours afterwards. He explained to me after we had a chat about it that he was afraid I wouldn't believe him or be angry, because at first he'd thought it was a weird joke that made him uncomfortable, and he felt (rightly so) weirded out. I agree with the bulk of you that her continued touching is harrassment, and while a number suggested he just confront her himself, I empathise with being in a situation without breathing room where someone is sexually harrassing you. It's not easy, and you can quickly find yourself unsure if those brief moments of crossing a line happened. He's not on our lease, and understandably he was concerned about me and the power dynamic in the house (bc her room is a mini granny flat, she pays the bigger share).

I also don't believe that it was, as some suggested, a hypomanic episode. I have BP2 and while I understand the 'love rush', she exhibited zero other behaviours, and never tried to contact my BF outside of the weird touching. I also can appreciate there's no way she was actually in 'love'.

SO:

Yesterday, after a tense few days of trying to avoid her, my BF and I were in the kitchen at breakfast, with her around in the living area. I went to 'our' bathroom (she has an en suite) which is just off the main area to brush my teeth. I walked back out to grab my phone as she was sidling behind my boyfriend who was looking in the fridge, and caught her *running her hand and forearm across his lower back where his tee shirt had ridden up a little*. My boyfriend, who didn't see me, yelped really loudly and just lost it. He yelled at her to ""stop!"" and when they both saw me he starts going ""you see?! You see?! This is what I was talking about!""

I was furious, just whole body anger, and I could see she had now realised he HAD told me about her confession/behaviour, and just sprinted to her room and slammed the door. My BF and I went out for a walk to calm down, and he kept apologising for not being ""more firm"", but he was shaken up - some of you told me I should just confront her head on, which in the moment I 100% sided with, I was so angry for him. He told me he'd rather give her the opportunity to do it diplomatically. I appreciated what you guys said about lock down being extenuating, and in discussion with our mutual friend, I was willing to believe that an element of it was naivete, and a bit of fantasy gone too far. I was willing to be kind to her.

When we returned with a plan of action, we knocked on her door but she didn't answer. We tried a couple of times but she wouldn't come out, although she was 'seeing' my Whatsapp messages. Come late afternoon, I was just over it, so I knocked, and told her I was coming in. I sat her down on her bed and told her gently but firmly it was inappopriate, making us uncomfortable, told her she had to get the hell over it/herself if she intended to continue to live with us. She burst into tears and starts crying about how she's ""so sorry"" and what a ""bad person' she is, and she can't believe the pressure of lockdown is getting to her, whatever, and I felt bad. Started sympathising, trying to be compassionate...and then she says ""It's just so unfair that the guy I'm in love with has a really great girlfriend"".

Reader, I lost my shit. Unfair, *my ass.* I told her she had a lot of growing up to do, and perspective to learn, and that she owed the house an apology. She started to have a meltdown, a full, weeping, hiccuping snotty meltdown. *AND THEN*  when I stood up to leave, I spotted, in her clothes rack, my freaking shirt. I took it, and went back to my room.

My housemate cried loudy with the door OPEN until 7PM (for....attention???) when I cracked. I used our emergency contact sheet, called her mum, told her she had to come pick up my housemate. I've never met this woman who came rushing in like a superstar, but the look of annoyance and embrassament on her face when she arrived and found her 27 y/o daughter having a tantrum told me this wasn't a new part of her personality. My housemate also STFU pretty quickly after she realised her mum was there. They didn't say anything to us, and we just hid in our room until they were gone. I think she'll be gone at least for a while, but I texted her to let her know it would be best if she texted me before she came back. IDK when I'll see her. Technically the lease ends in August so my BF and I think we can make it work and find someone new, and if not, it's not so long til we can resign without her.

As a coda to all this?? My BF mentioned if she took a blouse, maybe she took other stuff too. I appreciate some of you may consider this an invasion of privacy, but I did go back in, just to check the clothes rack. I found: a set of my jeans, my tee shirt, one of my boyfriends work shirts, a vinyl I owned, my fucking charm bracelet from when I was a KID from inside my jewellery box, and a sheet of my old antidepressants...this was just what was on the rack/on display. I imagine there's more in the drawers. I don't know if this was the right thing to do, but I left them there for now bc I don't want there to be any 'doubt' she stole them.  There's zero chance she's going to live here any more. Honestly, I hope she does get help. I'm really angry and violated, as is my BF, but I can empathise with the havoc an uncontrolled mental health issue can wreak on your behviour, and while it's still wrong, it still sucks for her to experience it and lose friends. NOTE: *I can't be sure, none of us can! But I feel like maybe (?) she has a histrionic personality disorder.*

TL;DR: my relatively normal housemate who told my BF she was in love with him turned out to also be a thief. Yikes!!

PS! Our mutual friend has told me another friend who went to school with my housemate had told her a rumour she'd told a bunch of people in their year that she had leukemia. YIKES.

(edited for typo)",That‚Äôs a whole lot of yikes. I personally think you should go back and get your shit. You know she stole it. She knows. Unless you‚Äôre pressing charges it doesn‚Äôt matter. Since some of those items are sentimental you run the risk of her coming in the middle of the night and taking it all/ quietly moving out and never seeing your things again.,7449,159,2020-06-24 03:29:22,hetem6
relationships,"Update - is it worth it to try to work things our with my boyfriend, ho is jealous of my stepbrother?","[Original post is here. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/g367sr/is_it_worth_it_to_try_to_work_things_out_with_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

After I posted, I took some time to read the comments and form a plan. I texted BF, telling him essentially that I needed a bit of space to take a breather and reevaluate. I made it clear that I didn‚Äôt want to break up, but felt like I was always being monitored and I wanted to make a game plan to have healthy communication through this pandemic. 

He called me super upset and accused me of choosing SB over him. I told him that it wasn‚Äôt about SB, it‚Äôs not like I chose SB, he‚Äôs literally just someone I get along with who I can hang out with during the pandemic. I explained to him that it was not like I was spending every waking moment with him, I do my homework in the morning, we hang out in the afternoon, and my evening time is divided between the 4 of us (mom, stepdad, SB) and FaceTiming BF. 

BF then accused me of doing special, ‚Äúboyfriend‚Äù activities with SB. He told me that it was always his dream to teach me to drive (he doesn‚Äôt even have his permit. Am I supposed to wait around for him to get it?). Also apparently me teaching SB how to bake bread? Which is stupid because I was going to make the bread to begin with, and SB ‚Äúhelped‚Äù by moving the heavy mixer, eating half the almond slices, and taking pictures for Instagram. 

He also screamed at me for not moving in, saying how all this would have been prevented if we were living together. I told him that I have no interest in living somewhere that I‚Äôm not allowed to be. I can‚Äôt afford a fine from bylaw, and if I were to get kicked out, it would be more difficult to find my way home since I don‚Äôt drive. 

In the end, I told BF that I would not give up my relationship with SB, who is part of my family and a genuinely nice guy, to ease my BFs insecurities and cater to his demands. I told BF that I needed time to cool down, and that I‚Äôd talk to him in a few days. That was all on Friday, and today I reached out to see how he was. He was still pissed at me and accusatory, so I basically told him that this wasn‚Äôt working and I want to break up. I did it over text and then blocked him, which probably makes me an asshole, but I literally couldn‚Äôt deal with anymore of him yelling at me and insulting my family. 

Anyway thanks to everyone who commented. I‚Äôm really sad this is the outcome and I‚Äôve been crying a lot, but I‚Äôm also kind of relieved. 

TLDR: we broke up because he couldn‚Äôt see how controlling he was being.","Good call. Your gut led you on this one. This sort of behavior would have found its way to something else, if you chose to dismiss it.

Sounds like some real LDE, though.",7044,206,2020-04-19 19:08:15,g4ddku
relationships,"UPDATE to ‚ÄúI'm unhappy with how my (24 F) boyfriend (26M) treats me, but he won't listen to me for long enough for me to get my point across‚Äù","Here is the original post:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/grls25/comment/fs2iubn?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/grls25/comment/fs2iubn?context=3)

Tldr: confronted my bofriend about how he treats me after asking for advice on reddit. He cried and talked about his issues, we broke up. I'm much better for it.¬†

Firstly, thank you to everyone who commented on my original post. I got so much from it, and seeing so many supportive comments really helped me. I learned a lot, so thank you all so much. I realised through reading your comments that I was in an emotionally abusive relationship. It wasn't communication tips I needed, I needed to get out.¬†

The past month has been so up and down but I wanted to share an update. After a pretty weird ‚Äústepping on eggshells‚Äù kind of morning, I confronted him about his behaviour and mood swings. I prepped myself for a huge argument and honestly it didn‚Äôt go exactly as I expected. First of all he started to deny he was doing anything wrong, but for once I stood my ground. I don‚Äôt think he was expecting that. I had lots to say (many of your comments came in useful there), and I tried so hard not to back down.¬†

After a while he kind of‚Ä¶ changed. He got upset. He then started saying all sorts of things, that he was sorry but he didn‚Äôt realise how his behaviour affected me (though I‚Äôd brought it up many times). A little later on he said that he had been thinking for a few months that it was his fault my doctor said I had depression. So that‚Äôs a huge contradiction?? He said that for a few weeks he had been thinking about breaking up with me ‚Äúbecause it‚Äôs my fault that you are this way and breaking up sooner would have been the noble thing to do‚Äù, but that he was so torn for ages. He said that‚Äôs why he had been even more awful to me lately, that his frustrations were just coming out. Again, contradicting what‚Äôs he said about not realising how his behaviour affected me. He said he has never cheated but I‚Äôm really not sure if I believe that. Maybe it‚Äôs best if I don‚Äôt know.

Then something really unexpected happened, he started to cry, the first time I have ever seen him cry. He told me that he had been texting a work friend over the past few days about our relationship. He even showed me a message she sent to him which went something like this: ‚Äúyou have a wonderful, textbook girlfriend and you are fucking it up because you are being an ass. This is why everyone at work thinks you‚Äôre a psychopath. You are so cold and bad when it comes to feelings‚Äù. So I guess it wasn‚Äôt just me who found his behaviour not normal??

He cried even more and said that he doesn‚Äôt feel close to people, that there‚Äôs only a handful of people he lets in and he doesn‚Äôt know why he does that. He said that even being around his immediate family was cold and formal and he doesn‚Äôt know why he is like that and can‚Äôt connect with people, and that‚Äôs also why he throws himself into work so much. I told him that if he didn‚Äôt get help, he would end up a very lonely old man. In that moment I felt pretty strong and proud of myself.

So as you may have guessed, we broke up. Part of me for a while even thought about trying to save it and work at it, and now that I look back I can‚Äôt believe I was ever even thinking that. He kept saying ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt know what to do for the best, should we break up or not?‚Äù But doing so was absolutely the right thing. I‚Äôve since had many friends coming forward saying they didn‚Äôt trust him, something was off etc.

Regarding the girl I talked about, his ex who he cheated on his other ex with- I could see on her brothers Instagram a video of my ex smirking at his phone and the caption was ‚Äúhe‚Äôs thinking about my sister ;)‚Äù to which he replied with another winky face so‚Ä¶ what does that say. But I‚Äôm not looking Instagram at this stuff anymore. On the day we broke up he packed some bags and left, he told me to stay with a friend. It turns out that that friend was his exes brother, and he‚Äôs been living there for a month. I will be moving into a new place in 2 weeks and even though he has gone to stay with his friend he is still paying his share of the rent, he just swings by to pick up some stuff every now and then when I‚Äôm at work, I haven't actually seen him.

For the past few months I‚Äôve been feeling really low, with barely any energy. I‚Äôm picking myself back up again and though it‚Äôs a slow process, I‚Äôm coming back into myself. I‚Äôm determined that I‚Äôm not going to let anyone make me feel like that again.

I‚Äôm not sure if I needed to write all of that and if you guys needed all of those details, but writing this was quite cathartic. I guess I would just say, to anyone who is reading this and my original post, who is in a relationship that they feel horrible in, just leave. It‚Äôs hard, but please leave. You will feel SO much better.

Thanks again, Reddit.",I'm glad you got out! That situation sounds like it would have just escolated over time. You're young and have much better things to do than try to fix someone who hurts you. ‚ù§Ô∏è,6819,70,2020-06-25 23:08:27,hfwaxf
relationships,[1 Year UPDATE] My girlfriend (F 20) cheated on Me(M 21) with her bestfriend..,"An year ago I posted on his subreddit. \[Link below\][https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/d78jqe/my\_girlfriend\_f\_20\_cheated\_on\_mem\_21\_with\_her/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/d78jqe/my_girlfriend_f_20_cheated_on_mem_21_with_her/)

So I wanted to provide an update and thank my fellow redditors. I took the advice and broke up and realised that the relationship was really sucking the life out of me and was the worst thing in my life at the moment. Since then I have met someone who understands me and cares for me, theres no drama (Well I once ate the last pizza slice and she got pretty angry but yeah thats the level of the drama). We support each other and she makes me a better human all around.

Because of my ex i wasn't able to focus on my studies and the breakup combined with the Covid Pandemic gave me ample time for studying and I landed an internship at a big Bulge Bracket company and also Im working on a few personal projects that I love spending time on. The pandemic also gave me time to realise that I was with the wrong person and I love many others who love me be it my family, friends,etc. I feel really liberated.

Today I was looking back at what used to be and I remembered that this subreddit for the trigger point for the change in my life. SO THANK YOU AND YOU ALL ARE AWESOME. Its because of you Ive gone from Crying nights to Happy days.

Edit 1: Some edits based on comments.

Edit 2: HOLY SMOKES! I didnt expect such a reaction. Thanks Guys.

Edit 3: Such Wholesome Comments, Thanks Guys.

TL;DR! - Took the advice of fellow redditors and broke up with my ex and spent probably the best year of my life.","Guy. You ate the last slice!? You'd better be glad she's not coming here for advice on what to do about you! Seriously though, glad things are going well for you",6731,81,2020-12-14 12:57:02,kcx4yw

I was encouraged to do the dangerous thing and talk to her. We had a very honest conversation and she was very sweet about it and admitted that we did have something between us but we remained friends, with not speaking for a little while to begin with. As the months went by we both started seeing other people although I was still very much in love with her. Eventually both of us realised that we didn't want other people but only each other and a short time after that we got together. We have now been dating for 10 months and we are both extremely happy and are very much in love.

Just wanted to make an appreciation post for the ones who made me talk to her and to anyone who is in a similar situation as I was, it actually is possible!

relationships,"UPDATE TO: I [21/M] have been looking for my sister [18/F] since 2014. I found a way to contact her last night, but I'm not sure how to do it.","This is an update to [this post I made in January last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8uknz2/i_21m_have_been_looking_for_my_sister_18f_since/). Not many people saw it but I figured I'd update anyway because I got some good advice and, I don't know, the outcome might be something good to read while having a poo or whatever. Fair warning, this is a lot longer than I expected it to be.


**tl;dr (for the original)**: Sister has been involuntarily no contact with me since my parent's divorce. She lives with my narcissistic mother who would do anything to make sure I never see her again. I've found a way to contact her and I want to do it, but I don't want to step in her life and fuck it up for her. What's the best way to proceed?

**Update:** Well, I'm 23 now. Finished university, starting a real job, Dad and I no longer have depression, life is pretty good. As for my sister, a few interesting things happened to say the least. Firstly - I took the overall consensus from the original post and didn't make any attempt to contact her. I did drunkenly check her the page from time to time to see if anything had changed, and I found that I'd be unblocked on my main facebook account. Probably around August that same year, my sister rang my aunt and said she wanted to arrange a meeting with her and her son (our cousin, obviously). My aunt immediately rang my Dad and I and told us the good news, we were both uncertain about how we should take it but overall we were pretty happy. 

They all meet up and apparently my sister has also been kicked out of our mother's house for some reason or another and is staying with a friend, and she hasn't spoken to my mother for over a year (at this point in November). The story goes that my mother and her new victim managed to ostracise themselves from all their friends down there and my mother took out her aggression on my sister, so she stormed out and turned up teary-eyed at this friends house and has been living with them ever since. She asked about me and my father, if we were doing well, and if we 'hate her'. Obviously my aunt assured her that we definitely don't. My sister says that she wants to get in contact with the both of us but she wants to take it slow and she didn't know how we would react. In my view that's completely understandable\*.  That's interesting point #1.



^\*Just ^(as a side note, my mother once smacked my sister in the face for wasting a tampon when she was 12. I obviously am not completely familiar with that uniquely female experience but I did get the joy of hearing that moment unfold - just for an idea of the type of person my mother is and what she did to us both as kids.)


**Interesting point #2** happens when my sister goes, with her new boyfriend, up to visit our Nan\*. Another cousin of ours (big family) is also present for this meeting. My cousin tells me that my sister told our Nan that it had been 'a few months' since she had last spoken to our mother, which is quite a bit different to 'over a year ago'. Whatever, maybe my Aunt misremembered the meeting. However, my cousin did say that she got a very 'off' vibe from my sister, and to paraphrase her own words heavily, 'you would think [Sister] had last seen us all last weekend - not 5 years ago. She walked in to [Nan's] house like she owned the fucking place. She didn't really say why she was getting in contact with us and not [you or her father] other than she ""wasn't ready"", and she didn't really say why she hadn't spoken to her mother either. I don't know, I wasn't happy with it at all, and we were all thinking that you two [my father and I] should be in that room, not us. But maybe [your mother] has made me too paranoid.'

^\*My ^(Nan is my maternal grandparent. I phone her as often as I can which isn't as often as I would like it to be admittedly and I know I'll kick myself for it. I digress - every time I do phone her, she always asks about my Dad and his new partner, and sends them both Birthday cards, Christmas cards, so on. To me it just speaks volumes about the type of person my Mother is when her mother is more concerned about the wellbeing of her ex-husband and his new partner. Just tryna get this point home to any doubters.)

**#3** occurs when I find out that my sister asked my Nan for some money to help her out with University and not living with her Mother anymore. My Nan, being the lovely little 86 year old Welsh sweetheart that she is, gave her around ¬£2,000. Now, I'm happy to be proven wrong here, but asking for ¬£2,000 within a few hours of reconnecting with family that you haven't seen or made contact with for *five years* is very strange. I find out about this, because around November my Nan called me - because she had promised me an update on the situation - to tell me that for about a week after my Sister met up with them all, they had been in regular contact via phone and Facebook. Since that week - nothing. Unreturned voicemails, Facebook messages left on read, my sister had taken the money and fucked off. I spent the day reassuring my Nan that she hadn't done anything wrong, and she definitely wasn't the idiot she thought she was for giving my sister the money. 

**#4** is the least interesting, but you'll be pleased to know that my ramblings end here at least. It should go without saying that since the first meeting in August with my aunt and her son, neither my Dad nor I have had any direct contact with my sister. On Boxing day, my sister *finally* calls my Nan and wishes her a merry Christmas. My Nan says thanks and hangs up. In January, on my Nan's 87th birthday, my sister calls up and wishes her a happy birthday, and also mentions that she's having some money problems. My Nan rolls her eyes and hands the phone to my Aunt who buys my Sister's sob story hook, line, and sinker, and rings me to tell me the, quote unquote, ""good news"" and that ""it's different this time, she really wants to see you"". 

Around May (which is my Birthday month btw), my sisters sends a text to my Aunt to see if she has any old pictures of her. My aunt says she doesn't, but that me and my Dad might (which we do). My sister sends a text back saying that she will get in touch with us. 

I know this is gonna come as a complete shock, but it's been radio silence since and in all honesty I'm fine with that. To me, it's crystal clear who my sister has grown up to be like. Toying with family members emotions, treating her own presence as a gift and using it to manipulate money out of people, inconsistent stories about her relationship with the one person she knows would be a deal-breaker if the rest of the family knew was still involved, and terrible at hiding her true intentions. Will she ask me for the photos? Probably not. Unless she gets really desperate and exhausts all other avenues for exploiting money out of people with pity stories, but even she knows that I know exactly who that money is going to. My mother knows that she's not in my Nan's will at this point. 

If she does want to meet up, I will bring the photos with me. Part of me wants to bring two envelopes - half of the photos in one envelope, the other half shredded up in another, and depending on how well the meeting goes depends on which envelope she gets. I won't do that but it the thought of being that petty is very tempting. 

I'm not holding my breath. She was 14 and I was 17 the last time I saw her; she's turning 21 this year and I was 23 in May. I've had my years of anger and grief and done my time with depression, I've hurt many people and many relationships along the way. I'm still learning what's normal and what isn't, but on the whole my life is split up into *before* and *after*, and for the most part my sister lives and will remain in the *before*. Somewhat because I want to maintain the memory I have of her and not taint it by knowing what she has become, somewhat because I'm not ready to go through what I overcame again. I've accepted my role in the universe as the recipient of bad karma to make up for all the good karma that randomly happens to other people. I'm okay with that; for the first time in my life, I've been the one in control. As for my attitude to her and my mother, the best word I could adequately use to describe it is ""ambivalent"". They could win the lottery and be on the news tomorrow or they could get hit by a bus - my reaction would probably be the same. 

 To everyone else out there with estranged parents or other family members - the one thing I learned is that estrangement is the best thing they'll ever do for you.



**tl;dr**: I didn't contact her, and it turned out to be a good thing, but not for the reasons I thought.

Edit: Thank you all for your comments, I did my best to reply to everybody but given the response to the original post I had no idea this would get so much attention. 

* To the people that shared their similar stories, I hope you're all keeping well and staying positive and making the most out of what you've been dealt in life. Hard times make strong people. 

* In reference to my idea of ripping up the photos, that was always only ever half-serious. I wouldn't do something like that; it's petty, wouldn't be fair to my sister, and would only give me short term satisfaction in the form of a pathetic 1-up. I realised that before writing this post 

* In reference to the 'bad karma' line, I actually think I'm a very lucky man all things considered. I'm where I want to be in life, I have a fun and happy and stable family around me, and I'm confident in the person I've become. That line is a glimpse into my personality - some people got that, some people were genuinely concerned for me which I do sincerely appreciate. The black dog never really stops chasing you, but I get a much warmer feeling from being able to laugh at a universe that is seemingly constantly shitting on you than I do from pretending that everything is okay; that's what I meant by that line. 

Thanks again to everyone for taking the time to read, it felt good to get this off my chest and know that a lot of people think I'm making the right moves. A good amount of people made the fair comment that my sister is still young and still possibly under my Mother's influence. I appreciate those people taking the time to give feedback and advice, but ultimately my life had already moved on. I made peace with the fact that I may never see my sister again long before the events I've detailed out here, and when this all kicked off the closure and acceptance I had moved on from began to unravel. I'm not ready to go back into dark days off of a risk that everything might be okay. Yes, in the future we may reconnect, but for now I am focused on my own life and am content with taking some of the rare happy memories I had of my family in my childhood with me, untouched by these developments.",It would be a good idea if your whole family committed to not giving her any more money.,6373,73,2020-06-18 11:07:17,hbckl2
relationships,I (24m) don't want to come off as weird to my apparent guardian angel (40m),"**UPDATE:** 

Thank you so much for all of the advice, and kind words.  You guys are great!  I've been very hesitant to use reddit up until now but you guys have proven my skepticism wrong!  I've decided I most definitely should write a letter for sure explaining how much he has helped me, and how grateful I am.  I think it's probably best to avoid any strange verbiage like ""father figure"" or ""guardian angel"" just because I don't want to make myself uncomfortable more than anything.

Also!  I think based on a lot of your suggestions it might make me feel good if I got him a gift. Early on in our friendship he and I connected on our mutual love for fishing.  He is an avid spin fisherman, and I love fly-fishing, and actually am very good at it.  He mentioned to me that he'd love to learn to fly fish one day but never has.  Would it be cool if I bought him a nice fly rod and reel, and just added a P.S. to the note that I'll gladly teach him how to fly fish some day?  Or would that be weird?  Let me know! 

Also also!  Anyone know any good psychiatrists?  

Thanks for all your feedback, observations, kind words, and advice everyone!!!

**ORIGINAL POST:**

Most of my life after high school has been me skipping from job to job, either because of my inability to perform the job, laziness, or just plain rudeness on my part.  This probably all has a lot to do with a lack of a good relationship with my father.  I have struggled, even in childhood, to find anything I'm passionate about.  Often when I try something new I will get really excited about it and then be done with it after a week or two.  This pattern has lead to severe depression, and terrible relationships in most parts of my life.  I have a few friends who are close and supportive, but they are so keenly aware of how untrustworthy I am, just because I change my mind about who I am, and what I believe so often.

About a year and a half ago, I went to get my haircut at a barbershop near my house.  I had recently become miserable in my latest endeavor: teaching music.  I had never met the barber, and he had never met me, but he asked me a few questions, and I grudgingly answered.  He stopped cutting my hair, looked me in the eye and said.  ""You just need to be a barber.""  I laughed, and he reiterated, ""No, I'm serious, there's a school right down the street.  You need to be a barber.""

Flash foward a year and a half.  I've graduated barber school, and I have a job cutting hair.  I've never been more excited or passionate about anything in my life (aside from getting married).  The process of getting to this point has been insanely difficult, but also extraordinarily fulfilling.  I've never felt this way.  It's like no matter how much life sucks, I always have comfort in knowing that I am on a road to becoming a better barber.  To put it simply: this is the first time I've stuck with ANYTHING for more than 8 months, and I feel like I'm just scratching the surface!

During every step of the process of becoming a barber, this man has been like a guardian angel.  He not only directed me to the school, but somehow got my tuition rate lowered by speaking with the school owner without my knowledge.  He encouraged me every time I felt unsure or afraid, and let me stand next to him for hours on in at his shop and taught me everything I didn't get to learn at school.  Tricks of the trade, and his special secrets that he's learned over the years.  My wife (I know unbelievable that I'm married given my background right?) was ready to divorce me, and break up with me, but this man AND HIS WIFE counseled us, and helped us make it through the year of barber school.  As the icing on the cake, he secured a job for me, cutting right next to him, at his brothers barbershop.

This is just a sampling of the pure graciousness this person has shown me.  Every time I'm around him, I want to express to him how thankful I am, and how I want to make him proud.  It's like he's the father I never had.  But for some reason, I'm afraid that he will be put off if I thank him?  I'm not sure what it is.  I feel like I owe this man everything that I care about.  If it weren't for him I'd be working in Macdonalds, single, and probably suicidal.  (no hate for McDonalds workers, it's just not for me).  I just want to show him that his grace has NOT been taken for granted.  I want to make him proud.  I know this is probably really lame for this sub, but... it's so hard for me to wrap my head around how to repay him, or thank him without coming off as weird.

He has a son of his own, and I don't want to make him uncomfortable by making him feel like \*I\* look at him like a father figure?  I don't know if that's wrong or not.   Any advice is welcome.... please!

&#x200B;

**TL;DR**

My guardian angel helped (and is still helping me) get my shit together, and I'm an awkward man baby that feels like I have a new father and want to tell him I immensely appreciate him but don't know how to not seem weird about it?",[deleted],6219,223,2020-07-29 08:01:48,hzwqcy
relationships,My (29M) soon to be ex-husband seems to feel entitled to another chance with me (28F).,"
UPDATE: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/l5jc7c/update_my_29m_soon_to_be_exhusband_seems_to_feel/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf



My husband and I have been together almost 8 years, married for 2 and half of those .Last May (2019) we seperated seemingly overnight. He left me and our toddler and moved back to his hometown. There was never a solid reason given, just that he felt we should have never gotten married. In July, he changed his tune and wanted to be a family again. He was still at his job in his hometown, so I decided I would ride it out at my job in a different city for a couple of months to build my resume and then start looking for other jobs in his hometown. After 6 months of a brutal commute, taking care of our child during the week by myself and driving to his hometown EVERY weekend, interviewing, basically bending over backwards, I finally landed a great job in December. A week before I was to move into the new house we were buying together and start my new job, I found out he had been having an affair. He begged and pleaded for me to stay with him, said he‚Äôd break off all contact, and I foolishly agreed to give him another chance. Two days later while I was back in the different city and completing my last week of work at my old job, he unblocked her on everything and liked her pictures on Instagram. I was devastated. On top of that shit show, he kicked me out of the house we were supposed to move in together and I had to find a new place to live TWO days before starting my new position. We have lived seperately ever since. He has said and done so many hateful things in this time period, and said so many times that he wants a divorce that I‚Äôve lost count. Up until a month ago he was still maintaining contact with her. I saw her car at his house, took pictures for the lawyers, etc. and he admitted he had been talking with her still. I stopped doing the ‚Äúpick me dance‚Äù about a month ago and stopped reaching out to him besides contact about our child. Now he has suddenly changed his tune and is ‚Äúdesperate‚Äù to get me back and will do anything. He has unfollowed her on everything. Unliked all her pictures. Tells me not to give up on our family. I‚Äôve moved on... I am not interested in pursuing another relationship with him. He‚Äôs hurt me deeply and I feel like I‚Äôve been fucked over by him so many times that I‚Äôve lost count. How can I tell him there isn‚Äôt a chance without sounding like a completely heartless person? I still want to be able to maintain a strong coparenting relationship with him, so I am friendly to him, but he seems to take that as I want him back. I have relayed to him my feelings, but they fall on deaf ears. He says he will never stop trying to get our family back together and does not want a divorce. I do. Does anyone have advice? 


TL;DR: husband cheated and left me, was adamant he wanted a divorce, now when I want one too he changes his tune.


Edited to add, just to show the kind of person he is: When I asked him about the reason for his sudden change of heart, he said it was because I ‚Äúseemed stronger‚Äù. Ahhh, the irony. Honestly, a big thank you to the prick for yanking the rug under my feet not once, but twice, because I truly have realized how much better I can do and how I don‚Äôt need anyone but myself to have a happy life.

2nd Edit: Seriously, thank you to everyone who has read my story and commented. You have no idea how much it‚Äôs helping me to focus on myself and realize I need stop considering the feelings of someone who had no consideration of mine. I only hope that anyone who is in a similar situation realizes that you CAN and you DO move on. And I promise that you will feel like a 10,000 pound weight has been lifted off your back.

3rd Edit: He is being served papers in the next 1-2 weeks. Guarantee the ‚ÄúI‚Äôve Changed‚Äù mask slips off. I hope I‚Äôm wrong...but I‚Äôve learned all too well that my gut feelings are usually spot on. Hopefully I‚Äôll be back with an update in a few months with the good news that the split is official!","You are not ‚Äúheartless‚Äù for being direct about your feelings‚Äîand even if you were, why would you be so careful about his feelings when he cares so little for yours?

You need a lawyer to come up with a custody agreement. You do not need to be ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù with him to coparent effectively. You just need to be cordial and not disparage him in front of your child.",6163,255,2020-05-16 01:08:10,gklndb
relationships,My boyfriend's ex wrote a letter to me. I feel really strange and jealous even though it was a nice letter,"My boyfriend (26) was in a relationship with a girl for 3 years from 20 to 23. She's from the other side of the world and missed her home to much so eventually she went back and that's why they broke up.

Over the 9 months that I've been with my boyfriend he's told me a few things about her, all postive. From his friends I heard that they were THE dream couple and that she was a very kind and lovely person. Some said that they think he's never going to love again like he loved her which obviously hurt.

Well today it got weird. Apparently when they broke up she gave him a letter. Amongst other things it says that she wishes him happiness blah blah. But then it says that he should give another letter to the girl he finds love with again. Apparently she enclosed that letter. 

He gave it to me unopened. I didn't know what to expect. But she was so nice in her letter. Basically said I'm very lucky to have his love that I should cherish it and that I must be a great person if he's chosen me. Then she included some anecdotal tips on how to make him happy.

I just feel weird. This woman seems to be a saint. I don't know how to feel about this letter and the whole thing. Should I contact her? But what would I even say? Isn't it strange that my bf or anyone else hasn't mentioned a single negative thing about her? Somehow this letter made me jealous because I could feel a level of closeness that I don't have with my boyfriend. What should I make of this?
Ôøº
Tldr. Bf gave me a letter his ex wrote to me.","This is one of those things that's like beautiful in a movie but IRL it's fucking weird. Like how do they expect you/""future girlfriend"" would feel when reading this letter? It's really callous to me.

I don't think you should contact her, it's your boyfriend's fault that she's even a factor in your relationship at all. He shouldn't be holding her on this pedestal because it's going to ruin any relationship he has with anyone else that's not her. I would tell him that her letter makes it feel like you will never be as close to him as she is/was and it doesn't make you feel good about the relationship because it seems like you're his second pick.",6148,165,2020-07-14 11:10:08,hqzk0u
relationships,"My (22 F) parents (42 F, 44 M) are unbearable after the death of my fianc√©e (23 F) and I don't know how to cope.","TLDR: My parents have been trying to get me to move on really fast, get me to do all my classwork as if nothing happened, are pretty homophobic, and have been calling my late fianc√©e terrible things and I do not know how to cope.

So, I woke up to my fianc√©e being dead on Wednesday, April 1st 2020. She died unexpectedly and I don't want to go into the details of her death with strangers yet but it has been the largest, most traumatic event of my life. On the first day, I called her parents (50s M/F) who came and picked me up to stay with them for a week because my parents lived across the country and I just couldn't handle being alone in our apartment anymore. Me and her family, which are very kind and accepting people, grieved together and comforted each other. They were extremely sweet and kind people and I was very lucky to get to stay with them when it first happened. 

However, my parents were also informed of my fianc√©e's death and made the long, multiple day drive across the country to come. They packed up my apartment for me because I just couldn't go back there (which was very kind of them) and picked me up the night after her funeral to take me to my childhood home. The first thing my mom did was complain about her own problems and how disrespectful/inconsiderate I was to not thank her right away or something. I don't really remember exactly what it was about but I didn't have the energy to argue or put up with her so I just mumbled some answers and tried to remain quiet.

Then, later in the night as we were trying to go to sleep, my mom decided to start asking why my fianc√©e didn't care for her that much and I explained it was because she is homophobic. My mom then went into a huge screaming tirade about how she didn't want her daughter to be a lesbian (I remember her actual quote being ""Well, I'm sorry that I don't want my daughter to become a lesbian!"") and how us holding hands when she visited us last year was extremely disrespectful. (When she visited us last yet, she made my fianc√©e break down and cry so hard I had to drive my fianc√©e somewhere to be without my mom for an extended period of time.) I just cried quietly to myself until she stopped screaming and we went to sleep.

Around the first few days after my fianc√©e's death, I would wake up crying and in a panic. Her parents would just hug me and we would cry and talk until I was able to calm down, but my mom that morning reacted by screaming at me. She was saying things like ""Stop crying!"" and ""I hate [fianc√©e] now!"" and ""If she was alive, I'd kill her because you just keep crying!"" and just similar stuff. It made everything worse and I just wanted to throw up for the beginning of our long drive home. She also kept taunting me by saying she was going to put me in a mental health hospital or whatever it's called.

On the drive home, she kept bringing up negative topics any chance she got. During all these she called my fianc√©e a slut and a whore. She said that my fianc√©e ""looked like someone who would sleep around."" and just tried to disgrace her character. She then tried to convince me that my fianc√©e was toxic and controlling (she wasn't) and that she must've been abusive because she was driving a wedge between me and my family. It hurt me to even think that fianc√©e was abusive when she did nothing but care about me and was tender and loving to me.

When I was talking about how smart and beautiful my fianc√©e was, she kept saying I was smarter and prettier than my fianc√©e which just made me feel incredibly crappy. Sometimes, she would then have these strange mood swings where she would say ""If I could, I would kill myself so [fianc√©e] could be alive. That's what you really want, don't you?"" and when she would ask that, she would demand and answer and I just didn't know how to answer and I would end up crying harder. She also kept trying to say she knows what I'm going through and I have to toughen up but she married the first person she ever dated, so she never even went through a breakup before.

She would also continuously joke (?) about how she was going to buy me a blow up doll and dress her in my fianc√©e's clothes and it just made me feel so sick and uncomfortable and terrible when she would make that joke. She still makes that joke and now has my dad in on it.

When we got home, I thought I was going to stay with my grandparents (70s M/F) but my mom informed me that I would have to stay with her or my sister (20 F) because I might have the Coronavirus and she wouldn't want me to give it to my grandparents, who currently have my emotional support cat at their house because my parents and sister both have dogs. My childhood best friend (20 F) also came over to stay with me for a couple weeks (which is a blessing) but she only feels comfortable staying with my parents because my sister doesn't take good care of her house. So, I'm currently at my parents house.

Anyway, the day I got home, I went to my sister's house for a little bit to get away from my parents but my dad just ended up calling me on my phone and screaming at me that I only have a week (starting from Friday) to cry and get over it, then I would have to work and not be seen moping around or upset about it again. He also continued to call my fianc√©e a selfish bitch and told me that I needed to forget about her and get on with my life. This made me just break down. I called my ""mother in law"" (for lack of better term) and just cried to her about everything and I think she really doesn't like my parents now. But, she told me that they are just trying to make me feel better by treating this like a breakup. My fianc√©e's family is extremely religious (but accepting) and so they believe that like people need to be with their blood families to heal, so I think they're just having a difficult time understanding how my parents could be so mean but they're starting to understand every time I talk to them about it. However, they're on the other side of the country and there is nothing they can do about it now anyway other than listen when I call them. My parents don't want me to call them because they say that her family needs to grieve and I'm bothering them so now I'm really worried I'm just bothering her parents.

I also made it clear to my parents that I'm changing my last name to hers because that was our plan when we got married and it was important to me still and at first, when I told them on the phone a few days after she passed, they seemed okay with it but now that I'm here, they're throwing a huge dramatic show about it. They keep screaming about it and telling me that I can't change my name to a slut's name and that nobody would love me if I changed my name to hers and I'm just so worried that maybe they're right but I feel like it's necessary.

My parents' dog also has been growling at me every day because I'm new to him (they got him while I was gone and living with my fianc√©e) and my dad today yelled at me to stop ""moping around"" so the dog will stop growling at me because he thinks the dog growls at me due to my coldness or something. I don't know. I ended up breaking down in the shower because it's the only place I can be alone anymore (my room doesn't have a door) and I desperately miss my fianc√©e and the life we made together. 

I'm ashamed that I'm 22 and am living with my parents right now and I'm just depressed and anxious and scared. None of my coping mechanisms I have learned from my depression and anxiety therapist have worked and I don't know what to do anymore. 

What can I do to make my parents more empathetic and caring? I've always been somebody who just needs to be held and told sweet things to when bad stuff happens to make me feel okay again but they're just making everything worse. When I talk to them they just shrug it off. One time, I asked my mom if she could be nicer to me and she said ""I am being nicer than usual."" I don't know what to do anymore. I just need to know what to tell them so they stop all this and become kind and sweet and consoling. I just need it and her family knew I needed it but they, for some reason, don't understand. I've been hugged and cuddled more by my once to-be in-laws than by my own parents after all this happened. Please tell me what to do to get them to understand and treat me better. Or just tell me what I should do. I don't know anymore. I'm struggling.

I can't keep the tears in much longer.","Got about two paragraphs in and couldn't read any more. You need to get out, immediately.

relationships,[UPDATE] I [25f] asked my SO [25m] what I thought was a reasonable question. He thinks it was loaded and unfair.,"This is in response to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/e9op2w/i_25f_asked_my_so_25m_what_i_thought_was_a/) post, which received an overwhelming and surprising response. 

After the events of the post, I sent my boyfriend an email (after we spoke on the phone and I voiced all my concerns), essentially saying that I loved him but we had different needs. He wrote me a long email back, which was very surprising to me since he doesn't like to show emotion in any way. He said he feels as if he's become a shell of a person and that he would really like to work on things. I agreed to try, vowing to myself that something major had to change.

During all this, I bought 'Attached' by Amir Levine (after a few commenters suggested it). It completely changed my outlook. I identified so strongly with the anxious attachment style and I really felt my boyfriend was avoidant. A lot of our problems made sense. I started to work on sorting through those issues individually in therapy. I tried to put a stop to my protest behaviours completely (threatening to leave during fights, ignoring messages in hopes that he'll 'miss me', asking for reassurance often). I even recommended that he read the book. He read the first chapter and immediately agreed that we were anxious/avoidant.

Over a month later, I've felt a growing distance. The future is looming and decisions need to be made. I started doing more without him. Looking at flats alone for once. Yesterday, after weeks of not discussing 'the relationship', I asked him if he felt a disconnect too and he said he did and was glad I said it. We then agreed that it wasn't working and likely never would due to our differences. 

I'm pretty devastated. We ended on incredibly good terms and I still think the world of him. It's hard for me to know if I'm doing the right thing or if I expect too much. He's such a stable, solid, kind presence in my life and I feel thoroughly alone. I do realise that I went through this for a reason, it's just hard to remember that right now. It's just very raw at the moment. I'm hoping time heals all wounds and this isn't something I grow to regret. 

Thank you to everyone for your support on the last post. It's really helped me get through all this so far. I go back and read the comments every time I wonder why I went through with this. 

tl;dr I tried to make it work with my boyfriend after realising we have different needs. It didn't work out and we ended civilly. I'm feeling shattered and scared, but hopeful I made the right decision."," It is so easy when someone cheats or betrays you, but the relationship where two people are good people but not compatible is sometimes the hardest to end.",5615,86,2020-01-26 19:30:36,eubfeu
relationships,UPDATE: Boyfriend (27M) and his girl best friend on social media being excessive,"If you want to read the old post:

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/hpi6lz/boyfriend_and_his_girl_best_friend_on_social/)

I read all the replies and I got many messages for an update. I appreciate all the advice that everyone gave. I called the bird brain last night and basically went off on him. He had explained that they previously did have a past many years ago but they had reconnected after his last relationship but it was strictly platonic but THEN...

He tells me that he has herpes? That's one thing. Then tells me that I should possibly get tested. The last time we were physically together was in May. I confronted him and asked him if he slept with someone and he admitted that he slept with one person (pretty sure there were more). He said it meant nothing and it was only physical and there was nothing emotional about it. I asked why he did it and he said it was more of a ""last hurrah"" before he moved but it was with someone totally random. I asked how you meet someone random and he hesitated and said Tinder.

Hearing all of this I didn't know what to say and was in complete shock. He said he was sorry and it didn't mean anything. He said he understood if I wanted to break up but would still want to be friends because ""I'm really important in his life"". I obviously immediately broke up with him but it feels like a huge weight is off of my shoulders. I don't plan on being friends with him either since it shows that he‚Äôs trying to have me around in his life, more of a benefit to him. He's a piece of shit and I'm glad he has herpes :)

Another UPDATE:
There were things I needed to get off my chest for my own closure and so I sent him a message saying that I‚Äôm not comfortable being friends after everything that he‚Äôs done and he‚Äôs trying to keep me around and what not. He responded back with a few messages but the one I thought that was hilarious was when he said ‚ÄúI am upset about the whole situation and the prospect of losing you in my life. You are an amazing woman and it was a pleasure getting to know you. I wish you the best and hope down the line, we are able to reconcile.‚Äù 

I realized with his response, he never apologized for hurting me or about the situation itself and saying HE‚ÄôS hurt? I‚Äôm glad I got out of it sooner then later. I removed him off all my socials as well 

Thank you everyone for the comments and support. I‚Äôll make an appointment soon to get tested





TLDR: The tool slept with someone else while we were still exclusively together and is a piece of shit","Uhhh ‚ÄúLast hurrah‚Äù? What a odd and suspicious thing to say as a reason.

Tl;dr: we broke up lol 

My previous post got more attention than expected so I figured I‚Äôd update.

Well, it‚Äôs over. As many of you suggested, I couldn‚Äôt possibly build my life around someone who lied so pathologically. 

I initially agreed to work on the relationship provided that my ex get therapy to work through why he felt compelled to lie about so many aspects of his ‚Äúlife‚Äù. I also requested that he come clean to his parents, my parents, and anyone else he lied to or embellished the truth to. He agreed to this and seemed genuinely interested in working on things and himself. I really wanted it to work out and was willing to accept that maybe he was just wildly insecure/had some attachment issues or something that caused him to act this way. I waited 4 months for the therapy and confessions to happen and they never did, not surprisingly.

For those of you who were confused about how I didn‚Äôt know he did not own this apartment for so long/thought I had never met his parents - I had met them many, many times. But tbh they are pretty cold people who I never really connected with that much and was definitely not comfortable enough to be like ‚Äúhey, is your son a pathological liar or is all of this true?‚Äù. On top of that, he also told a lot of these lies to his parents as well so they wouldn‚Äôt have been keen to what I was talking about anyway.

It got to the point where basically anything that came out of his mouth seemed like a lie or at least a half-truth to me. Also, I lost respect for someone who could lie so easily and then not even feel guilty enough or any remorse to come clean about it. I‚Äôm pretty honest, almost to a fault. So the cognitive dissonance there that occurred from being with someone who had basically opposite values from me was tough.

I‚Äôm sure there were a lot of other things he was hiding, but I don‚Äôt even care. I‚Äôve been single and living alone for a week and to be frank I‚Äôm killin it. Im now responsible for 100% of my rent and I barely have any savings left, but I still feel like a giant weight has lifted off my shoulders. Crazy how that works. 

I want to thank all of the people who gave me the hard truth straight up and encouraged me to leave. Even though it was all coming from internet strangers, it still helps to hear people tell you that you deserve more than what you‚Äôre getting. I‚Äôm so happy and I must be giving off a much better vibe because I‚Äôve already had 2 dates and been asked for my number a handful of times (I‚Äôm a server at a restaurant lol). I sound like a cocky asshole but god does it feel good to remember you‚Äôre not as worthless as someone made you feel. 

Thanks Reddit, and if any of you are in a relationship with someone who is like this - GTFO and don‚Äôt look back.",">I sound like a cocky asshole but god does it feel good to remember you‚Äôre not as worthless as someone made you feel.

No one asked for an update, but I thought I'd provide a short one.

**TL;DR: I never have to see John again in my entire life. David and I broke up. I moved away and cut off contact with everyone. Also, turns out I'm gay. Life is good now.**

Shortly after this post, David and I had a sit-down talk in which I said I was no longer comfortable going over to his place. I showed him this post and how he was getting roasted in the comments. He agreed and started coming over to my place more. However, this became more lax with time and laziness and he started asking me to come over to his house, which I hesitatingly did. Basically, it backslid into how things were before, and he made no real effort to change anything. At no point did David consider moving out, and as far as I know, they're still roommates.

It's been a while now, so I honestly can't remember if John ever made an attempt at making an apology, but at any rate he never made an apology I deemed to be genuine and he always made me uneasy. No more serious incidents occurred. John never touched me physically. For this, I feel exceedingly fortunate.

A few months after I made that post, I started wanting to move away for various reasons (mostly wanting a change of scenery and culture), and I realized that I didn't consider my relationship valuable enough to make me want to stay. That was over a year ago.

We broke up, I moved away, and in quarantine I've reconsidered my sexuality and am now dating a lovely, thoughtful, and supportive woman. My life is much better now and I see that that I was allowing myself to be treated in a very horrible and toxic way. I also see that everyone in that house was -- in a way -- gaslighting me into thinking that John's abuse wasn't so bad in an effort to not ""rock the boat"". No one, at any point, made any effort to stand up for me, including my supposed romantic partner (which, honestly, now disgusts me). I'm not in touch with anyone from that circle anymore and honestly, good riddance. I'm so relieved that I never have to see any of them again.

Anyway, despite being in lockdown and living in a deep, existential anxiety, I'm very happy and life is drama-free (aside from the fact that I still have to come out to my family, lol). Thanks everyone for pushing me in the right direction.

**EDIT:** I was not expecting this to blow up in the way that it has. ""David"", I know you have a reddit account, and if you're seeing this, I hope you're doing well. ""John"" is hella toxic. Good luck with everything.

**EDIT 2: Seriously, this response is overwhelming. Thank you all so much for your support and well-wishes. I hope all of my future coming-outs go this well. <3**",I loved your tl;dr and thought you were making a joke. I'm glad your life is doing better.,5391,58,2020-08-12 18:42:44,i8jgfi
relationships,Update: Me (F29) with my BF (M31) of 3.5 years won‚Äôt help me clean or do things he doesn‚Äôt care about," This is an update from my previous post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/egckva/me\_f29\_with\_my\_bf\_m31\_of\_35\_years\_wont\_help\_me/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/egckva/me_f29_with_my_bf_m31_of_35_years_wont_help_me/)

I ended things a little over a month ago, and things have simultaneously been terrible and amazing. I asked him if he would be willing to go to therapy with me, and he refused. He told me when we first starting dating that he would never go to therapy, and I assumed he'd change his mind at some point because he would care enough about me and our relationship to work through the hard things in counseling. We see this all the time on this sub, but really, when people tell you who they are, believe them.

Refusing to go to therapy really left me with the two choices of staying and having nothing change and being unhappy... or leaving. I opted to leave even though it was scary and so, so hard. The initial heartbreak is starting to fade, and I'm working on rediscovering myself. I know that I did the right thing for myself, but it was also the hard thing.

I kept this throwaway account around, and I'm posting this update because I wanted to thank this community and the individuals who offered their input. I know I didn't comment on anything in my original post, but it was very helpful to have some outside opinions. I appreciate you all so much. Thank you for your advice and assistance when I was faced with a difficult situation.

relationships,"I (36f) have had my head in the sand but I've finally realized that my husband (37m) has never been ""into me""","I'm not sure how I ended up in this horrible place in my life but I guess it's because I believed what I wanted to believe rather than what was obviously right in front of me.

&#x200B;

I won't bore you with all the details but suffice to say he's 100% my type and I've always been gaga over him. When we met 7 years ago I had very limited sexual experience. He had plenty. Right from the beginning, he was very take-it-or-leave it towards sex. I asked him several times if he was attracted to me. He always said yes, but that he just was on medication that dampened desire / exhausted from work. We had very little sex and I was insecure and never initiated. I figured he'd had SO much experience that if he wanted sex he'd initiate.

&#x200B;

We were like best friends who had sex sometimes (like maybe every 6 weeks). This was not enough for me but I accepted it because I loved him so much and I was too shy to have a really frank discussion. Nor did I want to make him feel bad. I also was always there for him in every way (emotionally, practically, etc). He really grew to rely on me because he suffers from ADHD and depression and often needed my support in many ways (which I was happy to give).

&#x200B;

There were many hiccups. I caught him texting other women a few times. He watched porn a lot. I figured he was intimacy avoidant or something. But I truly loved him.

&#x200B;

We got married. Once we had a huge fight and during it our lack of sex came up. He was always suggesting it was my fault but I didn't think it was. He'd call me a prude but I honestly couldn't understand what he was talking about. He cited the fact that I never got on top. I always feel awkward on top and it doesn't feel good and he never told me he liked it so I didn't think it mattered. I brought up the fact that he always wanted oral but never once had returned the favour (still hasn't...not once). We were fighting and it was escalating and he told me ""*if you want to know why I've never given you oral it's because you disgust me sexually*"". I was hurt and shocked but he later told me he didn't mean that.

&#x200B;

We've had several more fights over the years and once he told me he loved me deeply but wasn't attracted to me. He took that back too and said he didn't mean it. But our sex life never improved at all.

&#x200B;

Recently he got angry at me and called me fat. Later I asked him why he called me that and he said he was sorry for being rude, but that I have to admit that I'm fat. I am overweight (BMI of 27) but so is he. I honestly didn't think he viewed me as ""fat"". We talked a lot and he said he loved me very much and I was perfect for him because he fell in love with me, but that no, my body type is not his type at all. He has always preferred petite athletic women.

&#x200B;

It just all hit me. Our sex life has always sucked not because of medication or depression, but because he never was very attracted to me at all. He was with me because I provided companionship and love and support and he grew to rely on me and love me. But he's never felt any passion towards me.

&#x200B;

He says it doesn't really matter because he truly loves me and he's willing to work on having a better sex life with me. He says when we grow old we'll be unattractive anyway and love is all that matters.

&#x200B;

I'm just hurt and freaked out because I've been living this lie thinking we both felt the same way about each other when we clearly do not. 

&#x200B;

I'm wondering.....does it even really matter? Does ""lust"" matter? Does it matter if I'm not his physical ideal? Can we still have a happy marriage if we are both in love and committed to each other even if he apparently doesn't have any real sexual feelings towards me? 

&#x200B;

I'm so confused and I'd hate to make a mistake and get divorced from someone I really love just because he doesn't find me hot. Can anyone help me view this more clearly?

&#x200B;

tldr: husband has never been ""into"" me and I'm unsure if I should continue the marriage.","I don‚Äôt understand how you can claim to be in love and be such good ‚Äúfriends‚Äù...when he insults you the way he does.  I‚Äôd never say something like that to a friend in anger.

relationships,UPDATE - Boyfriend has stopped being romantic completely," 

Here's the link to my original post here : [Original](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/j7ftmw/boyfriend_has_stopped_being_romantic_completely/)   
But the TL:DR : Boyfriend (18M) has completely stopped flirting with me(18F) and I'm not sure if I'm being needy while he's at school and how I should approach him about the issue.

I just want to say thank you to the original people who commented and reached out to me, I was very emotional at the time and needed some sense talked into me.

That day I made the post, I was supposed to hang out with my friend and her friends, so I had sat down with them and asked for advice. They basically said the same thing everyone here did and I guess seeing their in-person reaction to me explaining everything that had happened made it click that something was really wrong. After getting over my fears of me being right, I asked him if he still wanted to be with me. While he didn't say no, he said he enjoyed his newfound independence from school and not having to worry about anyone else. This confirmed what I already knew and I knew he wouldn't directly say he didn't want to be with me anymore, but I still got my answer in a way. While I'm hurt, I think I had already grieved the relationship during it, since I spent a lot of time crying and wondering what had happened between us. At least now I can move on instead of holding onto every small sign that he might still like me.

I wish he could have just been up front sooner, and just told me he didn't want a relationship when I kept trying to flirt or be romantic instead of just ignoring those moments, as it just left me confused, and I wish I could have avoided this completely but I suppose it's a lesson learned. I deserve someone who's going to reciprocate my feelings and affection, so I'm excited to see what happens now. Thank you guys for the kind words and advice.","It's a coward's breakup.

relationships,I (f32) kind of want my boyfriend (m35) to be my dad,"Just the title sounds creepy... Me and my bf have been together for only six months but have been friends for about a year longer than that. We only ever hung out with a friend group and did dnd together and stuff, and I fell in love with him without really hanging out at his house or interacting with his kids. I knew he HAD kids (m7, f12), and he'd talk about them, but I didn't meet them until I was already in love with him.

Some background: I came from an abusive household. Both of my parents were emotionally/psychologically abusive and my father was an angry drunk who threw things and punched walls. I've been in therapy for it throughout my life (when I can afford a therapist, yay USA) but am currently not.

I've never really hung out around a healthy family with kids in it? I'm estranged from my extended family since cutting off my parents, and most of my friends either don't have kids or they're very small babies. The first time I went over to my boyfriend's house, his kid was acting up and I felt my whole body go tight waiting for him to get angry/aggressive with the child... and he didn't. He was kind and gentle. I was absolutely just... I'd never seen that.

The more we spend time together and the more I see him around his two kids... I keep having these sort of earth-shaking revelations like... This is what parents are supposed to do. This is what it's supposed to look like. My therapists had explained, verbally, what it's supposed to be like, but that's very different from actually SEEING a parent who genuinely loves his kids and treats them well. I love spending time over there because when he is kind and gentle to his kids, I like... passively absorb it, is the only way I can think to explain it. I feel safe and warm and protected in an extremely just, primal way? That I never felt in my own house or anything.

To be clear, I know what daddy kink/DDLG is... and this isn't it. It's not sexual at all. I just see the way he takes care of his kids and wish that I could just ... duck under that umbrella and be cared for like that too? One time he was telling me about the custody battle he went through with his ex-wife, who didn't want him around the kids, and how hard he fought to stay in their life and I just started crying. He was comforting and I tried to explain that no adult in my life would have ever fought for me like that. I told him ""I wish I'd had a dad like you"" and he said ""I wish you did too."" Which was very sweet but I just worry this isn't something I'm supposed to want from my boyfriend, or feel for him...? He knows about my parents and we've talked about it a few times. He gets it because he didn't have a great upbringing either.

It's probably not okay to cross wires like that... I believe in communication in relationships so I probably need to talk to him about it. But how do I tell him so it doesn't come off creepy? There's just so much positivity and warmth and unconditional love in his house and I want to just... wrap up in it like a warm blanket. But it's not mine... it's his kids'. And I probably shouldn't get the wires crossed like that? I don't know. If I hadn't had to change jobs during covid I'd talk to a therapist again but financially that's just not an option right now.

TL;DR - Raised in an abusive household, now see how my amazing boyfriend loves his kids and I wish he'd take care of me/love me the same way, since nobody ever did. Is that wrong? Do I talk to him about it?

EDIT: Wow so many comments. Thank you all for your kind words and advice. I'm definitely googling a lot of the ideas and books and things everyone mentioned. I didn't expect so many people to relate to this. It's kind of sad and really.. heartwarming? I was worried I was messed up and that I should shove these feelings away and felt guilty for feeling like that, but a lot of you suggested it's just love. Healthy love, and it's okay to want that. Which feels like it should probably be obvious. I've decided not to make a big deal out of it or have any kind of Talk about it, but just keep telling him how much I appreciate him and the things I see in him. Thank you all again for so many comments and advice and ideas!","I don't think you want him to be your dad, you just want to be treated with the empathy and respect he treats his children.

So tell him how you feel, just don't say ""I want you to be my dad."" That'll probably spook him, but beyond that yeah tell him you've never seen a parent treat their kids right like that and it makes it feel amazing to be around him. And how much you want more of that. I'm sure he'll feel flattered for basically being called an awesome dad, and then he'll feel able to become more emotionally close to you.",4925,178,2020-10-17 15:17:33,jcwxd4
relationships,My [F27] flatmate [F27] has told my boyfriend [M31] she's in love with him.,"I [F27] moved into my flat in October of last year to take the place of a mutual friend of mine and my new flatmate [F27]. We have a generally great atmosphere in the flat, and both have similar expectations and habits and while we're not 'friends' yet (as in we wouldn't go out for brunch or be each others plus ones for parties) we are very friendly. She seems super normal and level.

When the lockdown began (March), my boyfriend [M31] of two years was living with his sister, and his mother (undergoing chemo) who lived alone, needed somewhere to stay where she could be looked after, so she moved into his room and he came to stay with us. My flatmate was totally fine, and we had a proper chat about ground rules etc, but ultimately the flat is huge for two people and she has a kind of granny flat set up in hers. Either way, she gave definite approval. 

Now, we three got on great, but never really spent a tonne of time together. We all work from home and spend the occasional evening playing games or whatever, but ultimately we didn't mingle much more than before. My boyfriend, however, cooks every night for the both of us, as a thank you, and so we do now eat together, and my flatmate seemed happy to be included.

It was great. However, last week, my boyfriend took me aside and told me that while he was in the courtyard hanging out the washing she ""ambushed"" him from behind and gave a huge speech about how she's in love with him, and while she ""respects"" he's with me, she has deep feelings for him, and that she's available if he were single. Oh, and please don't tell OP. She didn't try to kiss him, but tried to hold his hand.... 

He was very anxious and flustered when he was telling me this. The flat atmosphere is VERY awkward now, but as far as she knows, he's not said a word. She's not said anything else to him, but he did mention that she had touched his arm a couple of times as she was walking past recently and it's really gotten under my skin. My BF is also confused because he hasn't spent that much time with her apart from dinner, and never alone. 

I spoke to our mutual friend who was shocked, and says she's never done anything like this before, and she'd never known my housemate to have a crush on anyone either. I've not seen her acting strangely in any other ways, and it hasn't outwardly affected how she treats me. We can't move rn because: virus, money etc. How do I deal with this? 

TL;DR: my flat mate has told my boyfriend she loves him while he's staying with us, and we can't leave.

(note: edited for typo)","Broooo wtf. As the other comment says, have a serious & long conversation with her. Your boyfriend included.

I have always been an introverted man, my ideal night is a quiet one in-front of the tv with my wife. I loved raising my 3 kids and was sad to see them go when they left but was also happy that they was living their own lives and I could enjoy the piece and quiet that I hadn't had for a long time. All of my children are married now, my eldest (32M) is living a successful life with his wife and children. But my daughter quickly lost her job and couldn't find a new one and relied on her husband's (31M) wages but had 3 children (6F, 5M, 3F) despite it not really being financially viable. They fell behind on rent and couldn't support themselves so they all moved in with my wife and I. Then my other son and his wife (26F) had 2 children (4M, 1F) and they made a lot of financially bad decisions including buying an expensive car from a unreliable person. It turns out the car was stolen and it was taken by the authorities and my son lost a lot of money on it. They too couldn't keep up with bills and looking after their children so moved in with us. My wife welcomed them with open arms.

My wife enjoys the quiet life like me but she is also more of an extrovert and she loves having the kids and grand-kids around.

I shouldn't have too put up with this at my age I have done my job as a parent and I shouldn't have to do it again. I get no peace at all I can't read a book for 5 mins without being interrupted by a screaming child. It's horrible having 11 people crammed into one house, granted it's a big house but still. Even going to toilet is such a pain because I always have to wait for multiple of my family members to go first. What's really annoying is that everyone else seems very happy with this arrangement. I know they are all looking for jobs but I don't particularly see them putting in maximum effort to find somewhere else to stay. I am really reaching the end of my tether and when i tried to talk to my wife about it she was appalled with me saying that you don't stop being a parent once your kids move out and I should help them in their time of need. I sort of feel like she is right but at the same time I just can't stand this anymore. What do I do?

TL;DR- My grown up kids, their partners and their children have all moved in with me and my wife. Ruining my ideal quiet life",This is such a tough situation. I‚Äôm sure everyone is trying to make the most of it. Try to sit the kids down and work through two plans. 1) you need breaks from the chaos. This means that your kids need to take the grandkids out of the house for long stretches a few days a week. Lots of things are still closed from coronavirus but they can go on hikes and picnics. 2) they need a long term commitment on finding work and moving out. This is stickier because the job market is so weird right now. But they need a plan. They need to work out budgets to figure out the minimum amount they need to make to afford an apartment and move out. Then apply for every single job in that salary range. You can do this. It‚Äôs tough times for everyone and it‚Äôs good to watch out for your family but you definitely need some relief.,4875,189,2020-06-06 12:10:07,gxpuj2
relationships,[UPDATE] My [23F] roommate [18M] continues making fried chicken and it makes me uncomfortable.,"Original post from a year ago lol: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/a25ti5/my\_23f\_roommate\_18m\_continues\_making\_fried/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/a25ti5/my_23f_roommate_18m_continues_making_fried/)

I figured I'd make an update because it's been a year and things are super different now.

In our house, with a new kitchen to work with, Louis decided to pursue cooking for himself as a hobby, and expanded his tastes. He still eats mostly meat, but has moved on to things like bacon-wrapped meatballs and burgers. The fried chicken was more occasional, and he improved his cooking style over the year.

Shortly after I made the original post, we talked to Louis about the jokes he'd been making concerning the incident. He genuinely didn't know he had offended people and apologized to everyone he thought necessary. Things were mended on that front pretty quickly.

We have since left that job and that housing, and so has he. But Louis proved to be one of the best roommates we ever had. He was reliable, fun to be around, and hard working. We consider him one of our close friends now, and are very grateful to have had the experience of living together. Thank you to everyone who commented on my original post, your advice was sound and you all helped me feel much better about the situation, which ended up turning out great.

TL;DR: Fried chicken-obsessed roommate expanded his palate. Ended up being one of the best roommates we've ever had.","So the girl with the third degree burns, I winced when I read what happened to her. Is she doing alright?",4658,37,2020-02-04 15:37:56,eyrss4
relationships,UPDATE: My (30M) Fianc√©e (29F) has discovered a new love of cooking and made me her unwilling sous chef,"[PREVIOUS POST](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/gzblnk/my_30m_fianc%C3%A9e_29f_has_discovered_a_new_love_of/)

My original post blew up in a way I totally wasn‚Äôt expecting. It seems a lot of people could personally relate to my post in some way so I hope it‚Äôs been helpful to others apart from myself. Thanks very much to everyone who commented; I wasn‚Äôt able to reply to everyone obviously but I did read as much as I could.

There are a few things I‚Äôd like to clear up since they kept coming up:

She is not doing this because she wants to spend more time together. Previously, we would spend most of our evenings together watching shows or playing video games. Now that she is spending 8+ hours cooking by herself I don‚Äôt see her as much, and she is too tired from cooking sometimes to spend time with me. So that's something that‚Äôs been bugging me about this that I hadn‚Äôt even realized.

It is especially bothersome to me because I work 50+ hours a week and she still works full-time as well (though her schedule is much more flexible). So now I feel like my already meager free time AND quality time with her is being cut into, which might be one of the most important aspects of this whole issue.

Her motivation is not to save money or be more healthy. We live in a big city where we are able to order lots of homemade-style ethnic food from mom-n-pop type places that isn‚Äôt overly salted or oily to appeal to the masses. It‚Äôs at least as healthy as the normal diet of a Mexican, Indian, Thai, Ethiopian, etc. person. Furthermore, we make a very comfortable income and don‚Äôt want kids. So money is not an issue.

So I sat her down and talked to her, again, because we were both in a good mood. But when I brought up the topic, she started to become annoyed, simply because this is a point of contention and I guess she didn‚Äôt want to talk about it. 

I told her that I‚Äôm invested in solving this problem and that if we‚Äôre unable to do so we can bring it up during couples‚Äô counseling. We had already intended to go before the wedding purely for premarital counseling, but now I feel as if there is an actual problem we have to discuss during the session and if we can get an appointment sooner rather than later I would be open to doing so.

This seemed to make it real for her. She seemed to be truly taken aback that I wanted to go to counseling over this (well, not over this specifically but that I wanted to involve a counselor at all in the cooking issue). She even became teary-eyed! I felt bad so I asked her if there was anything else bothering her, that was really at the root of this, and she said that she‚Äôs overall felt pretty depressed by the pandemic and quarantine and everything. I told her I could relate and let her cry it out a bit.

When she‚Äôd gotten past that I didn‚Äôt want the conversation to lose its steam so I brought up the following things:

* I love that her new hobby is making her happy and I appreciate that she‚Äôs making lots of delicious food for us to enjoy. 
* These are the problems I have identified which I would like to find solutions for:
    * We used to spend a lot more time together. I would like to have more easy meals so we can go back to spending quality time together on TV/video games/etc. like we used to.
    * I do not mind helping a little or hanging out while she‚Äôs cooking, but the disrespect in the kitchen absolutely has to stop. In future I will be getting up and leaving if she is rude to me in the kitchen. 
    * The unfeminist comment was a low blow and I would like an apology.

She said she understood these things and apologized for the unfeminist comment. We worked out a meal schedule where I would be responsible for providing meals 2 times a week and she would cook elaborate meals on weekends. One designated night would be for both of us to cook a simpler meal together as a couples‚Äô activity. 

I asked her if there was anything about this she wanted to bring up‚Äîabout how I was behaving or how she feels‚Äîand she said no, that she really was just depressed by quarantine and had dived into her new hobby. Hopefully if there is something else she will bring it up later.

That was a night where she was to cook a simpler meal for us. As a show of good faith I decided to help her out and see if she could be more chill and suggested we do all the prep first as some had suggested. It started off fine but she started to become snappish as she juggled frying in two different pans and wanted me to keep handing her prepped ingredients, so I went back to my room. 

I felt VERY bad because I was leaving her in a bit of a tough spot but I also felt like I needed to stand by what I said because I did not want to put up with her poor treatment of me. On top of that I had had a really difficult day at work (my job involves working with people who have very tough lives and I end up heartbroken and emotionally drained quite frequently; this has become exacerbated due to the pandemic) so I really just did not want to deal with my own partner being mean to me.

Ultimately the dinner turned out fine but she was pretty icy to me. I praised the meal a bit more than I usually do but she was sour all night. 

I have started looking to get a couples‚Äô counseling appointment soon. I wish I had a happier update for you but hopefully things will get better with our new meal schedule as we continue to implement it and as I continue to set boundaries. I will also be keeping an eye on her depression and suggest individual therapy if it seems appropriate.

**tl;dr**: We're going to couples' counseling and have implemented a new meal schedule.","I read and commented on your previous post, but now it's showing deleted. 

I'm glad you left the room. If you hadn't, you'd be telling her that you don't mean what you say. It's concerning that she immediately went back to snapping after your conversation though. 

You will have to keep working at this and holding her accountable if you want to help solve it, but ultimately only she can fix it. Hopefully you get a good counselor, and she puts in the work.",4656,119,2020-06-11 23:24:28,h794s5
relationships,I asked my bf for alone time and he told me to pack my stuff and leave for good.,"Okay, the title does seem a little one sided. 

Context: My boyfriend (29m) and I (30f) have been dating since last summer. I live alone in an apartment in downtown DC and he lives alone in a house in Annapolis about 40 mins away. Pre-quarantine, we did well will splitting weekends between the two places. Once states closed for COVID, we decided it made most sense for me to temporarily move in/stay with him in the bigger space with a yard for the dogs. 

As you might imagine, it‚Äôs had its ups and downs. We were getting a crash course in living together in a space that wasn‚Äôt really mine at all, having lots of important conversations, enjoying evenings cooking together and having wine while watching shows together. 

We‚Äôve also been irritable due to drastic changes in our daily routines. I have continued to work full time from home (+ overtime due to an even busier schedule) while he is only working a half day once a week. He is bored. I am stressed with work and finding it difficult to decompress. I am used to/need quiet time to myself to recharge and he likes a noisy household (TVs always on, music on top of that, chattering constantly about sports or draft statistics or things only of interest to him). I‚Äôve tried saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going upstairs to read‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôd just like some quiet time to myself‚Äù and it bugs him that I don‚Äôt want to do things that he wants. I find myself becoming more snappy and short-tempered from feeling constantly drained, which isn‚Äôt fair to him. 

Last night he wanted to watch the NFL draft so I made plans to FaceTime my girlfriends upstairs while he did that. I am used to weekly girls nights and miss them as they‚Äôre also my primary support network. I heard him downstairs complaining to his dog that I never want to hang out with him. After FaceTiming I went down and sat on the sofa with him and said ‚Äúhey I heard you talking to the dog, I came to hang out, how are *your team‚Äôs* picks doing?‚Äù. He was irritable and replied ‚Äúugh it was quiet until you came down‚Äù. I‚Äôm feeling like I can‚Äôt win. 

Alright; getting to the point now. I hadn‚Äôt been to my apartment in over 3 weeks and needed to go check on it (it‚Äôs not in a building, it‚Äôs in a row house) and pick up prescriptions I couldn‚Äôt have transferred. We were originally going to go together but seeing this irritation with each other I suggested I‚Äôd just go alone and take a night or so to myself to recharge and come back. 

COVID NOTE: I do not have to interact with anyone to access my apartment. My car already had ample gas. I literally drive from his house to my street, am alone in my apartment. Any exposure to no-contact takeout I would have gotten is the same as if I were there with him. 

This morning, when I grabbed some necessities for a night to myself (my laptop because I have to work over the weekend, some underwear, face moisturizer) he got upset and said I might as well take all my stuff and not bother coming back. I tried to talk through why it was so all-or-nothing for him. He said I clearly didn‚Äôt want to spend time with him or be around him so I can just go home for good and we can resume dating when the states open back up. He actually bagged up the remainder of my stuff and took it out to my car for me. 

Reddit, I just wanted to read in silence, get my medications (anxiety pills), water my plants, sleep in my own bed alone for a night, watch my own trashy TV shows without interruption. And now I think my relationship is over? I‚Äôm feeling frustrated that I attempted to handle this in a productive and proactive way and somehow screwed up. 

TLDR; boyfriend said if I wanted a night alone I should just take all my stuff from his house and continue to stay alone through the rest of quarantine (no added exposure risk). I‚Äôm confused with his all-or-nothing approach. 

So, what do I do from here?

EDIT: wow, this post blew up. THANK YOU for such thoughtful and thought-provoking commentary. I‚Äôve felt really supported and ‚Äúseen‚Äù by a lot of these replies. 
I‚Äôm still reading through and responding to comments but wanted to provide a quick update re: some things I keep seeing pop up. 

I am home in my own apartment, alone. He has not contacted me. I spent yesterday drinking wine, cooking, listening to music softly, FaceTiming girlfriends, caring for my plants, and reading a good book. (And checking reddit of course). I am not crying or sad. I feel comfortable and at ease in my space again. 

While bf is not working, he is still being paid his full salary. 

While I am currently working a lot, I normally have a much healthier work-life balance. Some big deadlines happened to coincide with and be exacerbated by the pandemic. it‚Äôs only temporary (a few weeks of hellish hustle). I was very clear with my boyfriend before this upswing started, and let him know I was going to be a lot busier and would appreciate his support extra for a couple of weeks until things settled down again. 

Many of you have brought up quality time. I have attempted to express my desire for quality time to him. Things as blunt as ‚Äúlet‚Äôs hang out together tonight, what should we do?‚Äù Or ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been sort of coexisting, let‚Äôs plan to do something together more like quality time.‚Äù Perhaps I wasn‚Äôt resonating with his communication style. Sometimes it would work and we‚Äôd have a nice dinner and watch a show together etc. and other times it would end in frustration and not go anywhere. 

In regards to the mattress thing, I am hearing all your replies about how it just wasn‚Äôt important to him so he didn‚Äôt want to compromise. It took my having a very dramatic hysterical emotional breakdown after nights of no sleep for him to realize how important it was we find a solution. That breakdown was loud and ugly on my part and not a moment I am proud of. It came after numerous ‚ÄúI‚Äôm really not sleeping well, I need more sleep than you do, can we work something out so I‚Äôm more comfortable‚Äù conversations. 

I am in therapy and understand I am a highly flawed human with dramatic emotional tendencies as well. I do not always communicate well. I consider myself very self-aware and make concerted efforts to require my default actions to create a better life for myself and my loved ones. 

And, finally, you are all not wrong that I have a low bar for thoughtfulness. It‚Äôs not really something I‚Äôve ever experienced in a relationship.","Sounds like spending time apart is not the worst idea, go home and decompress and let him reach out.",4648,164,2020-04-25 17:15:47,g7x81m
relationships,UPDATE: Should my brother [17M] and I [17F] invite my brother's [32M] crush [30?M] to Chinese New Year dinner?,"Really quick update to this [post](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/elwlz8/should_my_brother_17m_and_i_17f_invite_my/)

My twin brother and I talked to my oldest brother yesterday about inviting the brother and sister over for Chinese New Year because they didn't have any family.

He just laughed at us and said yes, it was fine and said he knew exactly what we were up to with the baker/brother but in like a really smirky kind of way. 

I think they've already been talking or maybe even dating but he refused to say any more than that and kept telling us to get ready for school and that ""good things take time"" and acting all ""wise"" and ""older brotherly"" and just annoying. 

So I told him he'd better get married by the end of the year so I could get more red pockets next Chinese New Year and he just laughed at me. 

When I went to the cafe after school today his crush told me that my brother had invited them over for Chinese New Year so I was ""oh really?"" and he kind of laughed at me too and told me I was a good sibling. 

So they are clearly together or together adjacent or something. Maybe they want to announce it on Chinese New Year.

But when my brother asked me what I wanted to eat on Chinese New Year I gave him a list of wedding foods and he asked me if I was getting married. But he's just been laughing at me and my brother the whole time. 

So we've just been annoying each other back and forth until he bought us ice cream to shut us up but he did give us hugs out of the blue today so I think I'll just leave it at that and they can take their own time with whatever it is they have going on.

But I do kind of want to tease him about it because I have little sister privileges and I can only abuse them for another year.

Well, as a likely shock to no one, we (me, 30F and him, 29M) broke up. It wasn't as swift as some comments encouraged... we reconciled after he insisted he hadn‚Äôt meant to end things and had overreacted out of emotion. We gave it another shot living in our own places again for a few weeks. Things went well enough, but unresolved trust issues became exacerbated as I was not in his physical proximity as often and he felt insecure about the distance between us. 

Ultimately, a few weeks after reconciling we ended up in another argument after dinner one night. There was once again a very disproportionate reaction to a situation that should have been more calmly communicated about, and I realized if we reconciled again I'd be in the same position a few weeks later... it had become an exhausting cycle.

relationships,My (M 26) parents (M 65) (F 60) disowned me because of my choice of career - now my mom wants to reconcile,"I got kicked out by my parents a few years ago because of my choice of career. I'm a cinematographer. When I tell people that I got kicked out because of my occupation, they always think I went into something drastic like porn or something. But nope. I'm a filmmaker.

Some context - my parents are African immigrants (Nigerian dad, Kenyan mom). I have three older siblings. The oldest is a doctor, second oldest a lawyer and third oldest an engineer. I was supposed also to into engineering (structural). I studied it in college. My parents were dead set on me becoming an engineer like my sister.

A lot of African immigrants who come to the West want their kids to have jobs like those my older siblings have. When I graduated, I told them I was going to try my hand at filmmaking. When I was in college, I dated a chick who was going to film school. She was an editor and she introduced me to filmmaking. I fell in love with it and began learning as much about it as I could. That summer I worked my ass off and bought myself some equipment and just started shooting. Everything and anything. It's amazing how much you can improve at something when you do it over and over again. Even shooting things as mundane as flowers made me a better cinematographer.

I began gaining ability with the camera and during college in my free time, I started shooting stuff like music vids for local artists, corporate videos, short documentaries. By the time I graduated I felt confident I could make a living in this trade. 

I was so scared to tell my parents of my decision. My dad had been talking to his friend (also an engineer) and they got me an internship at his firm. Around the same time I was offered to shoot a feature length documentary in a few countries in South Asia for six months. I chose the latter.

It didn't go down well with the rents. We had a big argument and they kicked me out. They told me I was wasting my time with filmmaking and that it would leave me penniless and on the streets. At my sister's wedding (a year later) they refused to talk to me. Acted like I didn't exist. That was the last time I saw them.

When I got kicked out I had just graduated from school. I didn't have much. My brother (the lawyer) took me in and I stayed with him for 16 months while I worked in order for me to get my own place. I'll never forget what he did for me. My other two siblings also thought I was wasting my time with filmmaking and but he was the only one who was so supportive and had my back throughout everything.

Things are good now. I'm financially independent. My career is in a good place. Getting a steady flow of jobs. I'm also engaged and get married next year. 

The other day I got a message from my mom, asking how I was. She also apologized for everything that went down. She wants us to meet next weekend. She said my dad is too proud of a man to say that he wants me back in his life, but that is certainly the case.

**tl;dr**

I haven't decided on the course of action I'm going to take. I'm inclined towards meeting her. I do miss my parents. Even though I am still hurt and angry towards what happened. And smug too, I'll admit. They thought I would fail. Almost prayed for it to happen. It didn't. How do you guys think I should approach this thing? How do I approach the meeting with my mom? I've been thinking about it over and over again. I'm nervous.

relationships,"UPDATE: My [24F] boyfriend [25M] is being passive aggressive about my injury since it happened when I was drinking and is also accusing me of ""overplaying"" my injury","[original post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/hoeaet/my_24f_boyfriend_25m_is_being_passive_aggressive/) 

So first off, I appreciate everyone's advice. I broke up with my boyfriend! I just couldn't get past him not taking my injury and pain seriously and basically blaming me for it. It was really hurtful that I was in pain and he didn't seem to care at all. It was a relatively smooth breakup. There was no arguing or anything. I told him how I felt and all he said was ""sorry"" but it wasn't a sincere apology. It was more of a ""sorry you feel that way.""

So I'm moving out. I'm in the process of beginning to move all my stuff out which I think is the worst part. It's especially not fun on a broken foot! My aunt and uncle live about 40 minutes away and they are more than happy to let me stay with them while I look for a place. 

Again, I really appreciate everyone's advice. I'm happy with the outcome and think it was for the best. If he couldn't take me seriously now, I don't think i could ever trust him to take me seriously or be supportive in a medical situation again. 

TL;DR: Broke up with my boyfriend today after he didn't take my injury seriously. I am moving out and feel good about my decision.","Yeah, he was treating you like garbage, and deserved to be thrown out as refuse in response. Leaving toxicity is so freeing once you're away.

So it's been awhile since my original post so I figured I'd give a quick update. I took some advice I received on this post and decided we needed to take action. I couldn't stand having this guy be around anymore, receiving praise from his coworkers while none of them know what was truly happening. I talked with a few of my coworkers about it and we started looking into our options. Our company offers a hotline to report incidents just like this, completely anonymously. Finally, after a little bit of debate, one of us called the hotline and reported the incidents. We waited to see what would happen. Eventually the security team reached back out to him and asked him for more information. They said they are building a case and they need as much information as possible. After hearing this, the rest of the us decided to report our cases to further aid in the building of the case. I remember the security officer telling me that things are going to ""move quickly.""

Well I guess in a big company they don't fuck around with this. Less than a month after the initial report was filed the creepy asshole was fired. The entire department was told to meet in a meeting room real quick for some news and management laid it on us that he was gone. He was a highly respected coworker who was really good at his job. The news was met with shock, especially since some layoffs had occurred recently. I remember my heart absolutely racing when the news was being given. I couldn't believe that it was happening. I really didn't think some anonymous reports would lead to action so quickly. The creepy guy was friends with some of the women in our department, and he was texting them constantly saying that he was innocent. He quit pretty quickly once they weren't having any of what he was saying. The rumors of why he was fired spread really quickly around the office, but fizzled out faster than I was expecting. I really thought this would be going around the office for months, but after two weeks or so people stopped talking about it and things returned to normal.

I really appreciate the advice on here. It was extremely helpful in my decision, and it worked out for the best.

TLDR: If you want to take pictures of your coworkers in the bathroom and you like your job, then maybe reconsider. Coworker fired for this very thing after being reported.","Good call, I cringed when I read the other comments saying to try to find a way to check his phone.

And he wasn't trying to fix our relationship at all, even though he swears up and down he did.

Instead of handling it well, he shows me an engagement ring his mom gave to him as I was breaking up with him and begged me to stay again. We didn't speak at all while I was away and I wish it stayed that way. I came back early January and our lease isn't up until February so I decided we could live together until then. And it was great until Monday, or at least I thought so anyway. We were talking openly about our feelings and he kept apologizing for everything that went wrong.  He still wanted to be my friend. (Hard no.)

It wasn't until this last Monday, that he got a new phone and switched over his sim card to his new one. While he was at work his old phone kept going off so I looked at it. I fully acknowledge that since we aren't together I had no right to go through his phone but the shit I found makes me feel no guilt what so ever. If anything, I'm proud I can see him for who he actually is.

I found out he went to see one of the doms he was cheating on me with in LA and never stopped talking to her, even before we broke up. And in $15K in debt from sending multiple doms money (SN: he always told me one of the traits he doesn't like about me is how badly I handle money. HAR HAR. Projecting much?)

After I saw this I puked, packed a bag and left. I texted him that I am leaving and unless it was about the apartment, I never wanted to hear from him again.  We've been avoiding each other since. I've been slowly moving my things out and putting it in storage and I just feel emotionally defeated.

I went through three months worth of messages and found a few interesting things other than the nudes, videos and pretty subpar sexting. He acknowledges that he lied and that he had an intimate connection with her. To which she replies, "" That's called deceit not cheating."" He's glad that it was her. Glad that he can finally make someone happy. Glad he can please his goddess. Glad to be ""free"". Upset that I never understood him.

wow. what a goof lol.

He is so disillusioned and addicted to this lifestyle that he genuinely believes she cares about him and that he's in the right. He thinks she's actually his friend, while she goes out to dinner with her boyfriend with his money and using him for emotional support (something he complained about to her about me. And how he loved emotionally fucking with me.)

She is being paid thousands of dollars to stroke their ego though, so I think I would understand that you have to keep the customer happy. She got $500 off of that LA visit which is pretty impressive if you ask me.

I feel like I should say that I respect sex workers and everything they do A LOT. But this specific dom is manipulative and has no boundaries. She is a half baked amateur at best who really has no clue on how to even pretend to know what she's doing. She gives actual doms a bad name.

Anyone who is a proper dom and actually cared about their subs well being would never do the shit that these two concocted. Like sending me a picture of her ass and saying she only did it because he asked her to. Asking him how he's going to spoil me today and him telling her that he's going to take me to get my nails done as a surprise. Him telling her how unappreciative I am of his gifts because they don't feel genuine (which they weren't lol.)

I never consented to any of this and this shit has fucked me up for life. But get this, she's an advocate for mental wellness. What a joke.

She praised him for getting out of a toxic relationship and was glad he could be ""free"" from all of my nagging and that I wouldn't hold this over his head anymore. (again, either she's really good at customer satisfaction or a really shitty person. More than likely both.) But he never told her that I was the one who actually ended the relationship.

But yeah, he never changed. He talked a big game but is so deep into his addiction and himself that he's willing to risk everything for it.

I should have listened to everyone's advice and left when I had the chance. I shouldn't have moved in with him. Instead, I was emotionally abused by a narcissist who felt that ""he did everything he could."" A direct quote he said to the findom he never stopped talking to for the past six months.

To those that are questioning and still have hope for the hopeless, get out while you can. You can‚Äôt change anyone that does not want to change themselves. You can‚Äôt convince someone they‚Äôre in the wrong once they see that they‚Äôre in the right. You may think that other people may not know them as well as you do. It‚Äôs just something you tell yourself to avoid the actual truth that you‚Äôre sacrificing yourself for someone who won‚Äôt even do the same for you. Take care of yourself first because you‚Äôre only damaging yourself in the long run.

Sorry if this looks all over the place btw. As happy as I am that I made the decision to leave, I am super depressed and feel like I failed. I know this is all his fault, but I feel like I should have seen this coming. That besides this one thing, he was amazing. But it was a lie. Reddit really helped me the last time and that‚Äôs the only reason I‚Äôm posting here.  Because I haven‚Äôt slept in the past three days and could really use some support and will probably regret posting this later lol.

tldr; I left my lying findom addicted ex and while I'm emotionally destroyed and angry, I'm glad I left. Send good vibes.

A couple of notes:

* For those that don't want to google, **findom is financial domination**. A more direct definition is ***financial domination*** *is also known as money slavery and is basically a fetish of people who want to be controlled by another person in exchange for money. They pay people for controlling them and the one in charge is known as a financial dominatrix. Usually, a male is the submissive who is referred to as a pay pig, a money slave, and even a human ATM because the findom can shell out as much money as they can from these subs.*
* I don't have a problem with findom. We actually tried it together. I was uncomfortable with it mainly because I linked it with his cheating and lying. I expressed that I wanted to be monogamous and he stated that he wanted ""help"" and felt ""sick"" and wanted to change. I said that if this is what he wants to do that's fine, I'm fine with that but I don't want to be deceived and used. Just communicate with me. But as I found out from the messages, he loved emotionally manipulating me and loved to see me hurt. He got off on my pain, a direct quote. He got off on mentally abusing me, and that's not ok.
* He also had a homewrecking fetish but I guess it loses the appeal if I consent to it I guess.
* mini-rant: **DON'T DO THIS TO PARTNERS WHO HAVE NO INTEREST IN YOUR KINK OR YOU HAVE NOT HAD THAT CONVERSATION WITH THEM ON WHAT THEY ARE OK WITHIN THE RELATIONSHIP. COMMUNICATE! GIVE THEM THE OPTION TO DECIDE ON WHAT THEY ARE COMFORTABLE WITH, NOT WHAT YOU THINK THEY'RE OK WITH. DON'T HURT SOMEONE ELSE IF THEY EXPRESS DISINTEREST AND GIVE YOU AN OPEN OPPORTUNITY TO LEAVE, BUT YOU ARE SO SELFISH THAT YOU RATHER LIE TO THEM AND PUT ON A FACADE OF ""WANTING HELP"".**
* you can probably find his post on r/stopfindom. I won't link it here but if you're curious it may be still there from like a year ago."," At least you can be out of this with absolutely no doubts. You gave him every shot to change, he was never going to. 

Break-ups are shit but I am glad you‚Äôre free and about to be in a much better place",4026,108,2020-01-20 06:52:40,er9lo4
relationships,[UPDATE] My [32F] boyfriend [32M] doesn‚Äôt see my long commute as part of my contribution to chores and my patience is wearing thin,"[Previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/eszfhr/my_32f_boyfriend_32m_doesnt_see_my_long_commute/)

I took your advice and told him we needed to work this out now - no more kicking the can down the road with ‚ÄúI‚Äôll think about it‚Äùs. I told him this on Friday and said to take the weekend and think things over and that we could talk about it when I got home - either together on Sunday (when I got back from visiting family) or in couples counseling on Monday. 

He opted to talk about it on Monday in therapy and made it seem like everything was fine in the meantime and then in therapy dropped the bomb on me that he thinks we should live in separate apartments but not break up. 

So essentially - I live close to my work and he lives close to his. Note that he doesn‚Äôt have a car and the closest train station is a 30-40 minute drive away from where I‚Äôd be. He doesn‚Äôt compromise in any way and I‚Äôm supposed to believe this isn‚Äôt a prelude to a breakup. 

I already feel like such a fool for having done this for almost 2 years because I thought we were building towards something together. 

Thank you to everyone that commented on my previous post urging me to tackle this sooner rather than later. This monumentally sucks and I‚Äôve been crying for hours (did I mention that my cat is going in for tests today to see if she has cancer? And this is the timing he chose to pull the rug out from under our relationship?) but at least now I know I guess. 

TLDR: I have a 2-3 hour daily commute which I‚Äôve been doing for close to 2 years while boyfriend walks to work. Tensions have been rising due to distribution of chores and free time. I asked if we could move somewhere halfway between our respective workplaces when the lease is up in May and boyfriend opted instead to tell me to move out to my own apartment if I want to continue in this relationship.

EDIT:
Thank you so much to everyone that has responded to this update post. My original post got a handful of comments and this update post blew up and I‚Äôve been so touched by the kindness I‚Äôve seen here. Even for those that said less than kind things - thank you too. I posted not for an echo chamber but to get all opinions and I appreciate the dissenting views as well. You have all given me a lot to think about and I‚Äôll do my best to respond to everyone but please be patient with me as it may take me some time. 

Again thank you :)","""We teach people how to treat us."" - it's super corny but also very true.  


 This sounds like one of those relationships a person gets out of and is then able to meet someone with whom they are compatible and can be happy. You gotta start asking for more for yourself. From yourself and from your choices \[in partners\]. This guy has shown you what effort he's willing to put toward being your **partner** in this relationship. He's suggesting you move out. Move out. Break up. Make yourself your first priority and stay busy. You will meet someone else who is dying to make you happy and who appreciates all you do for them. This guy would rather ask you to move out than make adjustments to the relationship to help you be happy.   


Oh, and 100% take the cat with you. No discussion. It's your cat. You take care of it.",3989,167,2020-01-28 14:56:31,ev6ls7

Hey,

It's been a while, and i know nobody remembers me but whatever. So i'm 23 yo now, and a lot has changed, after my last post, i spent the next 2 years doing nothing because i was broken.

I went back to study something i loved this year and got my diploma (BTS in France if you care, it's not much but it's alright.), and i'm now gonna push for more since i loved this year very much.

My ex-girlfriend ended up dating someone else richer and more handsome than me, but whatever. We're still friends tho, being the only woman on earth who has ever made me laugh. I did not date anyone else since, most women i thought i had a good feeling with did not find me attractive so i didn't push.

Well all in all, it's alright, i got my driver license too, your past comments ended up being useful for me in a way, even if i acted 2 years later.

Sorry for the typos i'm not fluent enough in english.

Tldr: I'm doing better career-wise.

Edit : I'm reading all your messages you are all very kind, I chose to respond to your comments with my main account ""Limanys"" because I don't care if my friends see my posts now. Thank you all","I‚Äôm proud of you. You identified a problem and you made the change to better yourself, even if it took you a while to get going.

relationships,Update: My (34M) GF (26F) of 6 months won't talk to me over an incident that happened 2 weeks ago.,"TL:DR GF wouldn't talk to me after some unfortunate events that happened that resulted in her officially breaking up with me this past weekend (OCT 17)

Here is the original post. [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/j9z5di/my\_34m\_gf\_26f\_of\_6\_months\_wont\_talk\_to\_me\_over\_an/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/j9z5di/my_34m_gf_26f_of_6_months_wont_talk_to_me_over_an/)

No one asked for the update, but I would like to say some things.

Well, I was finally able to see her over the weekend for my and someone else's bday celebration, it wasn't a formal bday party, just hanging a friend's house during the day and going out later on. She basically ignored me at the friend's house and when I tried to get a minute to talk to her about what was going on, she wouldn't spare a few minutes to let me say my peace. But she did tell me she was pretty much done after the initial birthday incident a few weeks ago even though she kept telling me she didn't know how she felt or what she wanted yet. It's been a few days and the rose colored glasses are beginning to come off. I still think about her and want to be with her but it's getting better by the day. I've also started to try to remember certain things that bugged me about her in an attempt to help me move on because I've always had an issue with only remembering the good. Thank you all for you insights and advice, it helped me come to terms with the fact that she overreacted and wanted out anyway and this was just a good enough reason.

&#x200B;

Edit:  Wow! So many people have wished me luck and brought up some thoughts I've had as well. Thank you all so much for your insights and ideas.  Anytime I find myself thinking about/missing her, I will come back and read these comments to push me through.  Oh yeah, and thank you for the awards as well!

Edit #2:  Somebody asked in the comments what hobby she was trying to get into.  I play tennis recreationally and I'm not sure if she was trying to get better at it for me, but she mentioned it several times that she would like for us to go and play together.  She even got one of our friends who also plays tennis, to take her out and show her some drills she could use to help improve her game.  She texted me last night saying she had some things to say and clearly I do so could we call and talk sometime, I said sure just let me know.",You're right OP...her reaction is so wildly illogical that I dont think she ever really was that into you. She probably was already teetering over an indecisive line and found a reason to say she isn't interested. Don't take it personal. You did nothing wrong,3977,165,2020-10-20 16:37:06,jet6a7
relationships,My girlfriend (F28) keeps escalating relationship way before I‚Äôm (M24) ready,"GF (28) wants full blown marriage and commitment from me (24) after only a year and a half.

I‚Äôve been seeing my gf since last November and I like her a lot. But she keeps escalating the relationship way faster than I feel comfortable. It started when I took out a lease on a bigger apartment last June and she just decided to move in with me, without even really asking. It‚Äôs been fine and I enjoy having her around. But then she took out a mortgage on a condo this October. I told her I thought things were moving too fast and she said, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, this has nothing to do with you.‚Äù I tried to tell her I didn‚Äôt want to move there because it‚Äôs way further from my job and I would need to buy a car to commute. She got upset and said I wasn‚Äôt committed enough to her.

The condo won‚Äôt be finished until December and I told her I‚Äôd think about it (which I have). But now it‚Äôs turned into her expecting me to help pay the mortgage, furnish the place out of my pocket, and go half and half on a car with her, none of which I agreed to. She also said she expects kids within 2 years, and that she‚Äôll go to a sperm bank if I don‚Äôt want to do it.  I just tell her, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll think about it,‚Äù to keep the peace. 

She keeps making these huge life decisions and just expecting me to go along with her. Should I just break up with her? It would break my heart. I really do love her and the life we have together now, as is. But I don‚Äôt want a mortgage, or kids. 

I‚Äôve never written any of this down before. The more I write the more insane I realize this is starting to sound. I‚Äôve just never initiated a breakup before. It terrifies me and I have no idea how to go about it. I keep ruminating about it constantly. It‚Äôs driving me crazy. I need help.

TL;DR 
GF is strong arming me into buying an apartment and having a kid with her way before I‚Äôm ready. I think I need to break up with her but I‚Äôm scared to.","I think the most telling part of this is where she continues to tell you that if you don‚Äôt want one aspect of this, she‚Äôll accomplish it another way. She isn‚Äôt treating you like a partner, she‚Äôs treating you like filler. You‚Äôre filling a spot in her life. She will fill the others by any means necessary. You cannot possibly want this for yourself, to just be a wheel on the vehicle that conveys her to her ideal future at the sacrifice of your own.",3966,222,2020-04-07 14:20:48,fwlbw9
relationships,Update: I (15M) broke my neck while skating. Parents (38F and 37F) are hesitant to let me skate again.,"https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/iheq1s/i_15m_broke_my_neck_while_skating_parents_38f_and/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share


Hi. So cheers for all the advice and all that stuff.

I spoke to my mum's and told them I was thinking about not skateboarding again. They told me that's good because they're not letting me. There were a few suggestions that I ask them to come watch me. When I floated the idea, it was shot down immediately.  I went to my doctor and she told me that she doesn't want me skateboarding again. She expanded on my condition after the accident to me and told me another fall like that isn't going to go well for me. She said even after I get this thing off, I'm going to need to go to therapy to build strength again. 

My mum gave my board to charity after we talked about it. I know they sound kinda mean, but they're really good mums. They're just very annoyed I did something very stupid. My girlfriend is annoyed me with me as well when she heard I heard I wanted to skate again. So overall I'm not skating anymore. 

TL;DR: I'm not skating anymore.","Your mums don't sound mean, they sound like they love you. You're smart for listening to your doctor, it must really suck to not be able to skate if you love it but it's not worth the risk, especially since you're still healing. We all feel a bit invincible at 15 but don't push it, a lifetime in a wheelchair or worse isn't worth it. You sound like a sensible young man with great parents. I hope your recovery is swift and your strength returns.",3944,79,2020-08-31 23:07:58,ik8t0r

&#x200B;

Well i don't think anyone cares about it but im a verry private person irl and i needed to get this out of my chest.

I visited my parents five days ago sense the lockdown got louser and basically i just let it all out.

I was afraid how my dad would take finding out my mother was cheating, but it actually was much better than i expected. he got really sad and angry at her but he didin't get angry at me, actually we had a really good talk about our family before i left. My mom was just as bad as i thought, she cried, she yelled, things even got physical. Long story sort i told her i hated her and she is dead to me then my dad send her to stay in our vacation house.

All these were 4 days ago. Im back to my apparment now. My dad isn't sure if he will stay with her or not, we have been talking every day cause i want him to feel supported. My mother has been calling and texting but im done with her hope she gets the message soon. Honestly these past few days i have been feeling great like im 50 kilos lighter.

&#x200B;

tl;dr I told my dad my mother wascheating on him and told her she is dead to me.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Dad decided to take her back, im still not on speaking terms with her.","That must‚Äôve been so hard to keep secret. Know that none of what follows is your fault.

relationships,"My parents hate when I ""space out"" when they fight or yell at me. What do I (17f) do?","I don't have the happiest home life, my dad and mom got into a lot of fights because he was cheating on her. I don't know why they're still together honestly

He and she fight a lot, and when that happens, I just kind of mentally shut down. Like let my eyes unfocus, stop paying attention to my hearing or other senses. Just relax into my own mind. It honestly feels like an out of body experience a little, I feel untethered from my own body, like I'm floating through empty space. It takes a while to come back too; like I feel kind of like I'm deep deep underwater and anything that someone says or does is blurred and delayed so much by the time it gets to me.

I know that sounds super weird but honestly it's the thing that's keeping me sane through this shit.

But I think it's been making my dad and mom really mad, when either of them is angry with me and I go to that place, they get furious, they yell at me for being a ""fucking vegetable"" and accuse me of being messed up in the head. Tried to shake me out of it once. Been telling their friends that I'm autistic. I don't think I am.

I know it makes them mad but it's honestly the nicest thing I can do for myself, I'm so sick of their shit. If I can't go somewhere physically, I guess the next best thing is to leave there mentally.

TLDR my parents get mad at me for going to that other mental place when there's anger at home, but I don't want to stop doing it","Hey, OP, I used to do the same thing with my parents, and later with several boyfriends. It's definitely called ""dissociation"" and it's a normal thing that your brain does to protect itself during traumatic events. It doesn't mean you're autistic, different, or broken in any way; it just means that your parents are awful, shitty people. I'm so sorry.

Unfortunately, there's not much you can do at all about this. You've probably said to yourself something like, ""next time I'll do *xyz thing* instead of freezing up and zoning out,"" right? After getting screamed at, I always tried to think of something else I could do or say the next time, but almost always ended up disassociating again instead. And the truth is that your parents, in that moment, are already targeting you with abuse, so they may pick apart or scream at you for *anything* you'd do in those situations. At least retreating into your head is predictable for everyone involved, and easy to do, so that's why your brain does it. It's okay.

At 17, you could try to become emancipated, but it may take longer than just waiting for your 18th birthday, depending on how far away that is, and honestly it's a pretty difficult legal battle. Your best bet is to try to just hold onto your sanity however you best can until you're 18, and then leave as soon as you can. If there's a friend's family who would take you in, I'd recommend reaching out to them. Finish school however you can, do well in your studies, and apply for as many scholarships and grants as you can if you want to go to college after high school. If you can't or don't want to go to college, that's okay too; you'll find a job, and there are resources out there in your state to help you get on your feet (medicaid, food stamps, section 8 housing, Planned Parenthood can help get you on birth control, etc) if your income is low.

When you leave, bring all of your important documents: photo ID or driver's license, passport if you have one, birth certificate, and social security card. You'll need your ID and soc card (or birth certificate) for onboarding at any new job, and the others are *yours* and will help you replace anything you might lose. Keep them in a safe place that nobody else can get to, and that can't be lost or stolen (don't keep them all in your wallet or car!). If you have a bank account and your parents are listed on it, you should make a new account at a completely separate banking institution once you turn 18, and don't tell them about it if you think they'll try to access your money. Move your money from the old account to the new account without telling them.

I've been where you are. I'm 32 now. It gets better. Your situation will get better too. Just remember that this isn't forever, and that you'll be able to get out of there at some point. And please reach out to someone you trust for support in the meantime! If I can help at all or if you want to talk, please feel free to reach out to me. I'm here and not going anywhere.

Edit: Thank you so much for the silver (edit2: and other awards, omg what?!)! I really appreciate it, but my main focus is on OP. Does anyone know of any trauma resources she might be able to access for free online, or other ways to help her without alerting her parents?",3840,122,2020-04-16 15:05:56,g2gm2h
relationships,My boyfriend[22M] told my best friend that he has fallen for her[21F].,"I\[22F\] am an understanding and supportive girlfriend, at least I strive to be that person. I have been with my boyfriend through his drug addiction, his university failures, him changing into a new university, etc.

For the past month, my boyfriend, Nick, has been hanging out with my best friend, Emily. They text, they share memes and she knows about him as much as I do, if not more. I am not an overly jealous person but it did make me uncomfortable when I realized that they had been spending hours together, just the two of them. Obviously I confronted them about it and both of them reassured me that it was nothing. During this time he also started bringing up things like, ""he needs his freedom and his independence and focus on his career,"" despite knowing I have been very supportive of his decision to change degrees and have been with him throughout the process and would not come in between him and his career. Recently my boyfriend told me that he felt very stressed in school and needed time to focus on it and wasn't sure if he could put enough effort into our relationship and I told him we could take a break, while he figured out what he wanted. Despite the break (where we agreed to not date other people) we still hung out and there wasn‚Äôt any bad blood.

But yesterday at my best friend's birthday party while I was inside, a friend of mine comes to tell me that Emily has her legs on Nick's lap and he's been massaging her upper thighs and whatnot. Obviously, I tried to be calm, but I did go out and see what was happening. I saw them sitting very close to one another, with his hand far up her thighs and the moment he saw me, he pulled back like he'd been burned. It was so awkward for me as we‚Äôd just been out together a day before and Nick gave me the vibes that our break was really temporary.

I confronted them after the party and my boyfriend kept bringing the whole ""freedom"" and ""independence"" thing and I broke up with him for real there because it was a little too much to deal with. I told my best friend, she has hurt me immensely and I left. My bf still stayed at her place after but apparently, nothing happened in between them. Anyway, the next day Emily calls me and she apologized to me, telling me she didn't realize it was such a huge thing and they were just being playful. She then proceeded to tell me that Nick told her he has fallen for her, she again reassured me that I mattered to her most and that she wasn't going to be in contact with Nick anymore because she doesn't like him and I know that is true because he is not her type. But I know that she loves attention, no matter if she's into the guy or not. I don't completely trust her because she did lead him on, knowing how that would make me feel. She kept on promising me that she won't talk to him anymore that she loves me, but honestly, their behaviour have really broken my trust on them. 

As for my boyfriend, I haven't been texting him because he knowingly hurt me, was dishonest to me, despite all the things I've done for him. He still insisted that his school is really affecting him and is the priority, but it's difficult to trust him after his actions. I blame him more as he was definitely aware of what was happening. I feel heavily exhausted and drained because of this and I would really appreciate some advice to help get me back up on my feet as I did not realize how bad this would hurt. I managed to keep my self-respect and calm in front of them, but it really hurt me from within. 

\[TL;DR: Boyfriend tells my best friend that he's fallen for her, and I need to know if I should trust either one of them anymore.\]

Edit: to everyone who‚Äôs telling he‚Äôs not my boyfriend and I shouldn‚Äôt refer to him, I know and I agree. I also wrote this post like a day after all the incidents happened and I was so used to referring him that way that it came out on it‚Äôs own.

Update: thank you to everyone for their responses, since posting this, I‚Äôve realised that they are still very immature and need to grow into their own. Some experiences in my childhood and initial adult years definitely helped me with my calmness and understanding in this situation. For now, I would break contact and let them become their own individuals and its good if they learn and grow from this. Thank you for everyone who commented, once I actually realised that it wasn‚Äôt me, my whole outlook changed and I do believe that all these comments really helped with understanding that, so thank you.","So your boyfriend wanted to break up but instead of just coming out and saying it, he gave you a whole bunch of crap about freedom and independence and then immediately went and hit up your best friend, making you be the one to actually instigate the breakup. 

Forget him. That relationship is over. As for your friend, how much did she know about the ‚Äòbreak‚Äô you were on? Did she think he was single? It‚Äôs still poor behaviour, but it‚Äôs up to you if you want to talk to her and see if the friendship can be salvaged.",3788,266,2020-03-21 09:03:44,fmc7q4
relationships,UPDATE: I (21 f) believe my boyfriend (32m) of 1 year is emotionally cheating on me &amp; I don‚Äôt know how to talk to him about it.,"Edit: I‚Äôm just now looking at reddit since I posted this and I did NOT expect this many replies, holy baloney. Thank you all for your kind words, encouragement, and tough love ‚ù§Ô∏è also, I just realized my title is weird, (&amp;amp;) I think that‚Äôs because I‚Äôm on mobile and I copy/pasted the title from my previous post. Sorry about that! 

[original post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/gq23vq/i_21_f_believe_my_boyfriend_32m_of_1_year_is/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf) 

My original post didn‚Äôt get a lot of interest but there were a few people who asked for an update and I really just need to vent. 

The night that I made my original post, Rick called me to tell me he was going to visit his brother who lives in a nearby city (Jolene also lives in this city). As soon as he called I knew what was going to happen but I kept my mouth shut because I wanted concrete proof. He was sharing his location with me &amp;amp;amp; I watched (and took screenshots of) him drive directly to her house, and stay there for 2.5 hours. I even texted my sister who lives about 20 min away from Jolene about it, and she drove there and took a video of his truck in her driveway. 

Needless to say I was absolutely pissed. I cried to my mom about it, then went to his house and packed up all my stuff &amp;amp;amp; brought it to my parents place. Not long after I got back to their house he called me to tell me he was headed home. 

I asked him ‚Äúso are you going to tell me the truth about where you were tonight?‚Äù 

He acted oblivious, said ‚ÄúI was just at my brothers, what are you talking about?‚Äù

When I said ‚Äúokay, if you‚Äôre going to lie to me that‚Äôs all I need to know‚Äù he immediately started apologizing, saying he just went there for a visit, he just wanted to see her daughter, and he wasn‚Äôt trying to hide anything from me.

My favourite part was ‚Äúif you would have asked I would have told you, all you had to do is ask!‚Äù 

Umm, I JUST asked you, and you lied to me??? So he asked if I would come and talk to him in person the next day. 

This is where Dumb Bitch Me ‚Ñ¢ comes into play. 

I went the next day after work to talk to him. I asked him to be honest and tell me if he slept with her. He said no. We had a long conversation of him saying he fucked up but he didn‚Äôt want to lose me, etc. etc. At the end of it basically we decided to still be together, but that it was going to take a lot for him to regain my trust. My one condition for him was to not talk to her, and if she did talk to him, or visa versa, I needed to know about it. I told him if that makes me a psycho bitch then he should just break up with me.

So for about 2 weeks we were still in a relationship but not spending near as much time together, saying I love you, or having sex. Basically it was like we ‚Äúrestarted‚Äù. HOWEVER during this time, she remained his best friend on Snapchat, and he continued to hide his phone from me. After two weeks I had gone to visit him, and we started talking about the situation. He was accusing me of cheating with someone to ‚Äúget back at him‚Äù (with zero reason to believe this), saying he feels like he‚Äôs walking on eggshells and that I don‚Äôt trust him and he can‚Äôt trust me. I asked him what he wanted to do about it because at this point I was so done with putting in all the effort.

He told me he wanted a break, and I told him I don‚Äôt do breaks. So we decided for a week we would just have some time to ourselves, but the rules of a relationship would still apply.

I left to go back to work, and that week he went and stayed the night at her house 3 times.

That week was so fucking hard for me, laying awake at night watching his location on my phone, knowing he was in bed with her. I barely wanted to exist, let alone go to work during the day.

So that weekend, I went to see him again and broke it off for good. I decided on my drive there that I was going to keep it simple and not blow up at him, so all I said was ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think we should be together anymore‚Äù. He hugged me, and his eyes got teary which was hard, but literally the next day him and Jolene were publicly dating, and still are.

Now I‚Äôm dealing with the aftermath of them turning certain friends against me as well. I‚Äôm not sure what he says about me but I‚Äôve already had a few people ‚Äúunfriend‚Äù and ‚Äúunfollow‚Äù me. I guess I just don‚Äôt understand how it‚Äôs not blatantly obvious to these people that he cheated on me but oh well. I wish I could tell everyone the whole story, and show them all the screenshots, so everyone would see what they really did but I know that‚Äôs not the right thing to do, and honestly it‚Äôs not the kind of person I am. 

The hardest part of this all has been the overwhelming feeling that I‚Äôm not good enough. I have always struggled with my self esteem, but this has completely destroyed my confidence, and I feel utterly worthless. I can‚Äôt get past the thought that I was just a placeholder for him until she wanted him again. 

TLDR: Rick went to see Jolene behind my back, I confronted him but we stayed together. He went and stayed the night at her house 3x so I broke up with him, now I am the bad guy and also Big Sad‚Ñ¢","Those 'friends' who cut you out without hearing your side were never good people begin with.

relationships,I (19f) Just found out my mom (38) has been lying to me about my biological dad. I left the house and I don't know where to go from here,"I've never had a relationship with my dad. He left when i was born and signed away all parental rights to me when he was 18 and my mom was 19. When I was 16 I went behind my moms back and got information on him, and found my aunt on facebook. I messaged her without telling my mom. Well, I didn't think it through because she told my mom that i reached out and asked for permission to talk to me. 

When my mom found out she cried and was so upset i didn't come to her. I felt like i couldn't because of how emotional it makes her. But she gave her permission, and we talked everyday and she also gave me her sisters facebook, who she said was ecstatic to meet me. 

Then, one day, they stopped. On the same day. I was so confused. Its been years now but i was so hurt and confused. I was so excited to finally know the other half of me, and it just stopped. It hurt a lot, but I let it go. 

Well, this morning my mom used my laptop and left her facebook logged in. As this has been on my mind consistently over the years, i just had to look at their conversation. When i found it, i was shocked. 

She told my aunt that she didn't want them contacting me anymore and asked that they would stop, and they respected it. I was just so shocked and hurt. I couldn't believe it, she never told me she did that. I had just spent years thinking they didn't care enough.  I got so mad at my mom, I packed a few of my things and left. Shes been texting and calling me like crazy, shes mad at me now and I don't know what to do or if i overreacted. She told me it hurt her badly for me to talk to her like that ten leave. How do I fix this, or can I? Its been about 7 hours now, and i'm at my boyfriends, but I don't have anywhere else to turn. 

Tl;Dr My mom told my biological family to stop contacting me and never told me. I found out today and i left the house.

Edit: my mom lied by omission. My parents dated for nearly a year before they had me- they went to prom and he attended her graduation(I have pictures) he was a year younger than her. He wanted to put me.up for adoption. My mom gave him a way out 19 years ago, and he took it.
Also, my moms not a narcissist. Highly emotional? Yes. She can also unintentionally gaslight situations, which is why I left.

Edit #2 my mom got married in 2009 and has had 2 kids since then",Reach out to your aunts. You are 19 now and you can make your own decisions about who to be in contact with. They will probably be delighted to hear from you.,3607,154,2020-04-13 20:10:14,g0qm1u
relationships,[UPDATE] Mom thinks our relationship could be better. I'm happy where it's at but don't know how to tell her.,"[Original Post Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/i76bqk/mom_thinks_our_relationship_could_be_better_im/)

TL;DR: I wrote down what I wanted to say, including boundaries. She didn't blow up, but as predicted, she didn't take responsibility either. But I've now done everything I can and can move on.

No one asked for this update, but I guess I wanted to give some of you ""told you so"" rights? I was able to use bits and pieces from almost every comment. From preparing myself for it to not go well/needing to hang up on her, to making sure I didn't fall into the trap of explaining/listing out past incidents. I basically said the following:

""I'm happy for \[list of accomplishments she's had\]. Unfortunately none of that erases 20+ years of lack of support and actions by you that clearly indicated I wasn't a priority. I'm not looking for explanations nor apologies. I've worked hard to make my peace with it, and I've worked hard to get our relationship to a point where I can maintain my mental health and have you in my life. So when you say it could be better, in my mind it's right where it needs to be. If that's to change at all, I have some boundaries that **need** to be followed: \[list of boundaries, some specific but two big ones of *Respect my boundaries* and *Respect when I say 'No'*\]. If you want us to talk more, I'm happy to pick up the phone. You have every right to ask things from me, but have to respect when the answer isn't what you want to hear.""

First question was if I thought our relationship was better before my stepdad came around - No.

Next was asking for examples when she didn't support me. I told her she'd have to do some reflecting because she was there for the same events I was, and it's not fair to me to ask for that emotional labor. She said she had done ""lots"" of reflection and couldn't see it ""until \[stepdad\] came into the picture"". She pushed a couple more times for examples. ""Is it because I missed some events *your dad* was at?"" She stopped when I called her out the second time for deflecting responsibility for her actions. I told her multiple times during this portion that she doesn't have to remember/own up to anything, but she does have to live with the consequences.

Her last question was, ""Is there any way we could ever push past this all?"" I told her this is what ""past this all"" looks like. She pushed back a little bit, but when it was clear that I wasn't moving an inch, the call ended with ""Well, thank you. You've given me a lot to think about.""



None of her questions or responses were any indication she was worried that I was hurt. She was trying to find justifications I might listen to, anything to poke holes. There was part of me that wondered if she always recognized how much neglect there was and just didn't want to face it, but claiming ""lots"" of reflection and not having a single incident come to mind that didn't involve blaming someone else answered that question. While she was ""calm"" while she tried to respond, her tone was very tense. Worst case here she continues to try to push boundaries and I cut off contact and it's one less stress in life, best case she respects them and it's one less stress in my life (I know this is likely a case of she'll respect them until she doesn't). The important thing for me was that I was up front with her and set clear boundaries. I've done my due diligence to telling her how our relationship could ""change"" (I used ""change"" instead of ""improve"" very intentionally with my mother). I'm relieved. Ball's in her court and I have some answers. Thanks again for the advice, sharing of your own experiences, and encouragement. It gave me the confidence and a plan for that phone call.

Edit: some typos

Edit 2: I'm relatively new to posting on Reddit so forgive any etiquette missteps please. First, thank you to the kind strangers for the awards! My first. Second, thank you to everyone that commented. I'm both happy and saddened that I'm not alone. I appreciate the perspectives that everyone brought; it gave me some new things to consider. Third, thank you for the recommendations for groups, books, resources! I fully recognize this is just one step in a lot to finding peace and have some reading to do. Good luck to everyone who's going through something similar, whether it's family or friends. Stay strong!","I've had this same conversation with my dad. He knows there is something to repair, but he wants examples just so he can argue with me about them. 

When he says things like this; ""She pushed a couple more times for examples. ""Is it because I missed some events your dad was at?""

I tell him ""that sounds like work you need to do in therapy. I can't help you work to an understanding of your actions when I'm the one that was impacted by them.""

He won't go to therapy, but I refuse to conduct therapy with him. So we are very low contact now.",3592,86,2020-08-13 13:51:26,i909r5
relationships,My (25F) cousin (26F) resents me for not having an arranged marriage and blames me for hers.,"Almost all the marriages in my family have been arranged marriages. My mum‚Äôs marriage to my bio dad was an arranged marriage but it ended up in a messy divorce and him completely abandoning us before I was even born. My mum had a love marriage the second time, despite the disapproval of her family, and has been much happier with my stepdad than she probably would have ever been with my bio dad. Because of this, my mum has always been very adamant that she would not try to force us (my siblings and I) into arranged marriages despite what the rest of our family thought.

I‚Äôve been with my fianc√© (26M) for 3 years now, we got engaged 2 months ago. He‚Äôs met my parents and siblings but as far as the majority of my extended family were concerned, I was single until 2 months ago. Early last year, my fianc√© dropped me off home after work one day and my uncle was there. My uncle is the oldest sibling my mum has so he‚Äôs seen as the ‚Äòhead‚Äô of the family (i.e. he thinks he has a say in what the rest of us do). It was obvious my uncle was pissed, and he ended up grilling my fianc√© and I assume he met his standards (a lot of arranged marriages are about what both families can gain from one another (e.g. wealth, influence, etc.)) so he told my mum to get us married quickly (he wanted to make it look like we had an arranged marriage before the rest of our family found out). My mum ignored him and told us to keep dating if it‚Äôs what we wanted. Over the past year, he‚Äôs mentioned me getting married to my mum every single time he‚Äôs spoken to her.

Apparently, my uncle assumed just because he‚Äôd given the ‚Äòorder‚Äô that we were going to get married soon. He told my cousin (his daughter) that I had agreed to an arranged marriage and because I had and she was older, she should agree to the match he‚Äôd found her. My cousin never mentioned this to me, but she did agree to marry the man my uncle found for her. They got married late last year. They haven‚Äôt had a good marriage and my cousin is very unhappy. Her husband is incredibly controlling and hardly ever lets her go anywhere without him or a member of his family.

Last week, she was over at my house when my fianc√© came over to drop some of the clothes I‚Äôd left at his place over. When I told my family about my engagement, they all assumed it was an arranged marriage and I didn‚Äôt bother clarifying because it really isn‚Äôt anyone‚Äôs business. You don‚Äôt tend to do sleepovers if you‚Äôre having an arranged marriage, so my cousin knew immediately it wasn‚Äôt what she assumed. She started asking me questions about my relationship and I answered honestly. She got really angry at me and kept demanding to know why I didn‚Äôt tell her about him. The thing is, I‚Äôm very close to this cousin but I also know how our family is about dating and I didn‚Äôt want my male cousins trying to strongarm my fianc√© (they‚Äôve jokingly threatened this before). She pretty much blamed me for her arranged marriage and said she only agreed because she thought I was going to have one too and if I had told her I had a boyfriend, she would have had the courage to stand up to her family. She hasn‚Äôt spoken to me since.

I do feel bad for her. I know how unhappy she is but if she had mentioned what my uncle told her earlier, I would have clarified. I don‚Äôt want this to be the end of our relationship, but I don‚Äôt know what I can do to fix this. Please help.

TL;DR ‚Äì My cousin agreed to an arranged marriage because she thought I was also going to have one. She‚Äôs since realised I‚Äôm having a love marriage and is blaming me for letting her agree to an arranged marriage when I had no intentions of having one myself.",She's blaming you because it's safer than blaming the person who is really responsible here.,3551,102,2020-09-29 19:21:09,j267bi
relationships,Me (29F) with husband (30M) who is a childcare know-it-all and isn't letting me bond with baby (.08M) on my own,"Sooo in the middle of this whole pandemic we‚Äôve managed to start a family. Life is tough with a one-month old but I‚Äôm afraid my husband‚Äôs very helpful behavior is actually very unhelpful.

My husband grew up in a big family and is very familiar/comfortable with the care of children and babies, including small infants. I had the opposite experience. When we decided to have a baby, for me it was kind of as if we‚Äôd decided to start a llama farm. I had zero experience or prior knowledge and I had to do (and still do) a ton of research.

It doesn‚Äôt help that I have severe PPD. I have already been seeing a therapist for a long time for depression/anxiety and have been put on an SSRI by my GP. So if you tell me to see a therapist and/or get medicated I‚Äôll ignore you because I‚Äôll know you haven‚Äôt even bothered to read my post.

The problem is that my husband (and his mother, who is actually a lovely and helpful woman who is bugging me for the same reason he is) is always swooping in to show me how to actually do things. 

I don‚Äôt have the muscle memory to execute the optimal way to fix a diaper or fill a formula bottle. My logical brain is confident that I‚Äôm not going to kill my baby but the depression and constant wearing down by husband and MIL is getting to me. They also know I‚Äôm not going to kill the baby but they always seem to know JUST what to do and when they see me struggling with something it‚Äôs like they‚Äôre hovering with itchy fingers just waiting to take over. The even more annoying thing is they‚Äôre right; whatever they do to soothe the baby and get him to sleep works like a charm. So on top of knowing I need to learn this shit myself I feel like a failure.

I feel watched and surveilled in my own home and like I‚Äôm not getting one-on-one time with the baby. I feel incompetent and helpless. I can feel learned helplessness setting in. I feel useless. I‚Äôve chosen not to breastfeed for several reasons so it‚Äôs like the baby really doesn‚Äôt need me. (I logically know this isn‚Äôt true because of attachment and all that but again, the severe depression speaks.)

I know someone‚Äôs going to be like wHy dOn‚ÄôT yOu JuSt TaLk tO HiM. Well no shit, I HAVE. Multiple times. I‚Äôve told him he needs to like, go out somewhere and take a break and just let me handle things so I can learn and bond with the baby on my own. He says ‚ÄúOkay, okay, I get it,‚Äù and then seems to promptly forget we ever had the conversation. He amazingly has selective amnesia regarding this specific topic. Ditto his MIL. He‚Äôs a very fatherly person so he wants to be all over the baby all the time, which obviously I get, but it results in this issue.

My family all lives far away so I‚Äôm stuck with these two. I really have vivid and deeply satisfying fantasies of taking my sharpest kitchen knife to both of their faces (which I want to say is just the PPD talking, but seriously I‚Äôm infuriated). But outwardly I‚Äôm too tired to protest. I‚Äôm tired all the time and I just want to be left alone. I feel like I‚Äôm being tortured in some kind of weird way and it kills me that we‚Äôre not all able to just chill and enjoy this special time with the newborn.

I told husband I think maybe we should try couples‚Äô counseling and his jaw very nearly hit the floor. He‚Äôs a great guy overall obviously so he was open to this idea but I could tell he was totally dumbfounded and couldn‚Äôt tell what the problem was. So I told him I just don‚Äôt feel heard and I feel like both he and his mom are overbearing. So then he got sad and was all like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just trying to help, I know it‚Äôs tough to be a new mom.‚Äù I got REALLY angry with him and said some not very nice things which I regret. My husband has (bizarrely) never dealt with mental illness so I think he‚Äôs really freaked out by the PPD.

Later I heard him talking to his mom in whispered and concerned tones about my mental health. So I feel like he is pathologizing this specific problem. I feel like I‚Äôm going crazy. Which I guess I already am. But you know. Is it going to kill either of them to watch me fumble a bottle or deal with a couple blowouts a few times? 

My Amazing Husband I Can‚Äôt Complain About has already taken it on himself to find a couples‚Äô counselor. Which obnoxiously is making me feel guilty, like, am I really complaining about nothing when I clearly have such a great guy? I mean, I know I‚Äôm not. But it‚Äôs driving me crazy.

Any advice in advance of us seeing this counselor would be really appreciated.

TL;DR: MIL and Husband are childcare know-it-alls and preventing me from learning and bonding with the baby on my own. Yes, I talked to him and no, it hasn‚Äôt solved the problem.","You should tell him that you want MIL to leave and give you some space to be a new mom. You feel like it's him and her vs. you. Tell him that you need him to back you up.

It sounds like he's smothering the hell out of you and that would drive anyone crazy. Get used to telling him and MIL to give you space. ""I'm changing the diaper. Go into the other room and let me handle this,"" or ""I'm filling the bottle. Go sit down and do xyz.""

Get used to this phrase: ""I am doing this thing. I will tell you if I want help."" When he forgets, reiterate that you are doing it and you will ask for help if you want it. Really nail it into him.

Honestly, if you have to, drag him to the doctor with you and explain all this to the doctor.",3520,211,2020-07-07 18:49:39,hn0j6j
relationships,I love you too soon update,"Hi,

Original post was here  [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/i2ymiq/saying\_i\_love\_you\_too\_soon/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/i2ymiq/saying_i_love_you_too_soon/) 

Thought I'd drop a quick update as so many nice people gave advice.

I was definitely over thinking things and suspect I was just being over worried due to his widower status (I've never really consciously associated that to him before I started reading some of the replies to my original post)

Over the past few weeks I've stayed at his more often than not and things have been great.

He hasn't said ""I love you"" yet but here's a list of things he has said/done that helped me realise not saying it doesn't mean he's not feeling it....

In no particular order:

The little messages in the morning/evening on the rare occasions I didn't stay at his. Yup he's still thinking of me even when I'm not there.

He ordered some toiletries for me on his weekly shop so I had some at his place too (After checking with me what I'd need) Plus I'm getting invited to join his ""meal planning"" discussions where everyone one in the house gets to pick at least 1 meal for the coming week (This is making me feel like part of the family and not just a guest)

He's cleared out some drawer and wardrobe space in his bedroom so I can keep stuff at his too (this one was pretty huge to me)

When his daughter asked ""Is Miss teacher going to live with us forever? his reply was a cheeky little smile and a ""Not yet"" - yup irrational or not the ""yet"" sent a few flutters off :D

He's really open about everything. He's admitted to me that at one point in his life he really didn't believe that he'd be capable of love again (in a romantic way) but he knows now that's not true (Perhaps irrationally on my part - I really did read that as ""I love you"" Just in a, I really can't say it way) 

He's arranged for his parents to have the kids this weekend so we can have a night away and a date or two because and I quote ""You deserve to be treated like a princess too sometimes and I don't want you to feel I only want you around for the children""

He's posted a few pictures on social media of us (with and without the children) my favourite being a selfie of all four of us snuggled on the sofa with the caption ""Star Wars night with the family - life is good"" 

After the previously mentioned Star Wars night, whilst we were being intimate I let slip another ""I love you"" in the heat of the moment and he replied ""I know"" which if you're a bit of a Star Wars fan (which we both are) is kind of the cool guys way of saying it. A little bit nerdy I know! 

TLDR: An update on my last post. Partner still hasn't said ""I love you"" directly but I'm 99.9999999% sure that he does. And I've definitely not scared him off lol","I remember your original post, this is a very sweet update. Actions certainly speak louder than words and his actions seem to be saying that he loves you. I wish you two a happy future together!",3516,72,2020-08-17 14:49:15,ibfil4
relationships,Fianc√© proposed and it all felt wrong,"My fianc√© (30M) proposed to me (28F) literally a week before quarantine hit. We traveled to the west coast to see his family and he proposed to me there.

My issue is that the trip was awful. His family judged me and nit picked me the entire time (telling me I wasn‚Äôt cleaning their house right or that we shouldn‚Äôt drink when we wanted to have a glass of wine on vacation). 

They had also offered their home as a place to stay while we were on vacation (and it‚Äôs his parents so he accepted and we brought them gifts) since he really wanted us to visit anyways for the proposal which was a surprise, but they insisted on doing every single thing together. They don‚Äôt like to go out for food or drinks, and we didn‚Äôt get to do much sightseeing.

All in all, it was the kind of trip I consider something I do for my boyfriend, not the kind of trip I would have chosen to have a proposal on. Of course I was happy when he proposed to me, but it felt heavily tainted by his family and the fact that he totally kept mine in the dark (and refused to even tell them he was proposing which again I didn‚Äôt know about).

I really love this guy. He‚Äôs caring and we‚Äôve built an entire life together over the last 6 years. I don‚Äôt know what happened here because it‚Äôs very unlike him, but I do know that he in theory wanted the proposal to be amazing, which is why he went through the trouble of planning and paying for the trip. It‚Äôs just that for me, it wasn‚Äôt.

This feels like it has tainted things for me. It‚Äôs not that I really care about the proposal, but it feels like the start of our marriage was around all of this. How do I get past this on my own? I really don‚Äôt want to bum him out more than I have (by expressing I wish my family was involved). I just have this constant anxiety over it that I need to somehow work through. 

TL:dr; boyfriend proposed on vacation to visit his family and the trip didn‚Äôt go well. Now I can‚Äôt stop feeling weird about it

UPDATE: I spoke to him and he has agreed to try therapy. So, we have our first appointment next week. I‚Äôm also making some lists of things I feel with the in-laws to try and identify boundaries I can set. Thank you all so much for your help! Will update how it goes.","You just got a sneak preview of married life with your in laws. If his parents are nasty to both you and him, and he's not going to defend you or want to back off from visiting them, this needs to be taken into consideration.

How much have you two talked about marriage? Did he know it was important to you to have him talk to your family before proposing? 

If this is giving you an icky feeling in your gut about actually marrying this person, you need to listen to that and deal with it. You need to talk to your fiance. You need to do pre-marital counseling (everyone should TBH). And you need to take note of how he handles these conversations; is he wanting to just stick his head in the sand, or actually talk about it and deal with it?",3506,145,2020-06-23 11:54:01,hed8es

He‚Äôd warned me that his family were elitist when we met, so I wasn‚Äôt that shocked by their reaction. In the end, he proposed and cut them off completely.

They tried apologising before our wedding, but my husband refused to talk to them and wouldn‚Äôt invite them.

Fast forward to now we‚Äôve been married for over two years and his sister reached out to me over Facebook. She said she‚Äôd been trying to contact my husband for a week, but he wouldn‚Äôt respond to her or any of their family and she didn‚Äôt want to deliver the news in a message. She asked me to ask him to call her. I mentioned it to my husband, and he said he wasn‚Äôt going to do it, and that this was another one of their games to try and get him to contact them. I relayed the message to my SIL, and she ended up telling me that their grandfather was very sick, and he was desperate to see my husband again. Their family is worried he isn‚Äôt going to make it.

I tried to tell my husband this but he‚Äôs adamant that they‚Äôre lying despite his sister having sent me pictures as proof (he refuses to look at them). His parents have both called me to apologise for how they behaved again and are begging me to convince my husband to see reason.

My husband‚Äôs grandfather is the person he was closest to and I know if he passes away without them making up, my husband won‚Äôt be able to live with himself. I know he‚Äôs still hurt by how his family reacted, but I think he‚Äôs letting that cloud his judgement. How do I make him see that they‚Äôre not lying when he‚Äôs in so much denial?

TL;DR ‚Äì My husband‚Äôs family were unhappy about him proposing to me and tried to force him not to. He ended up cutting them off and he‚Äôs continued to stay NC despite them apologising and reaching out several times over the years. Now his grandfather is sick, and he thinks they‚Äôre lying despite sending us proof and is adamant about continuing to ignore them.","You can't force your husband to get back in touch with his family, and if you try it's likely to cause problems between the two of you as well. 

You can say, once, ""I know you're still hurt by the way they treated you and us, but I worry that you're going to regret it if you don't see your grandfather before he passes away and I don't want to see you hurt even more by this. I totally support whatever you decide to do, but this is the evidence that he's sick, and I believe your sister when she says that he probably doesn't have much time left. Please think about it, and let me know if you need to talk.""

Then leave him alone. He knows his family better than you, it's possible that they really are using this crisis to try to bring him back in, where the control tactics and manipulation will start again. Trust your husband to know what he needs.",3499,171,2020-11-08 16:56:01,jqezuc
relationships,How can I (29F) get over the fact that I'm not my best friend's (30F) best friend?,"In 2013 after an exceptionally bad breakup and graduating from college, I moved to a New City and basically started my life over. After a few weeks of subletting, I found a roommate on Craigslist named Kasie (30F) who I hit it off with immediately. I've always been more of a 'boyfriend girl' in that I was with my ex from tenth grade until college graduation and he was basically my 'best friend' so Kasie was my first real girl BFF.

We lived together for four years until Kasie moved in with her boyfriend Jason (32M) and we had the best time. We almost never fought and spent all of our time at home together. We are both incidentally from the same home state, have a lot of similar interests and personalities and complement each other in lots of ways. I get along super well with Jason too and they never made me feel like a third wheel. I have a larger friend group now in New City and (thankfully) lots of girl friends but Kasie is still my bff and we talk/text constantly, hang out weekly, etc.

The problem: Annie (30F). Annie is Kasie's best friend. They've been best friends since their early 20s and are kind of a package deal. Annie is very cool and smart and funny and she and I are  good friends too and there's no competition between us or anything. She and I even hang out without Kasie sometimes. I can't stress enough that we all get along and that this isn't like the movie 'Bridesmaids' or anything!

But... sometimes I feel really sad that Kasie is MY best friend, but Annie is hers. Kasie will refer to me as 'one of her best friends' but we all know that Annie is #1. If Kasie ever says something like, 'You're my favorite!' to Jason he laughs and says, ""No, that's Annie.' If Kasie and Jason get married, Annie will be maid of honor, no question. Everyone kind of says 'Kasie-and-Annie' like they're one entity. They have very big and beautiful matching tattoos (though Kasie and I have matching tattoos too, but imagine it being something like a 1 inch potato because we're both from Idaho, whereas Kasie and Annie have gorgeous tattoos that cover most of their upper arm).

I don't know how to get over this sadness. It feels really childish. Kasie doesn't ever make me feel left out and neither does Annie. I love them both. But I guess I'm just jealous that I'm not anyone's 'favorite' in the same way. It feels extra childish of me because I have a boyfriend and I know I'm his favorite, but I guess I just never got to experience having a girl BFF who also considered me her BFF like that. How can I be satisfied with being almost-the-best and not the best?

---
TL;DR: My best friend, Kasie, has her own best friend, Annie. How can I get over feeling like I'm second best?","To quote the Mindy Project, ""best friend is not a person, it's a tier"". I have friends going back to middle school, who I would rate as best friends, but for all I know many of them have other ""best friends"". In fact, I know my cousin who is among my ""best friends"" will rate her childhood friend and her closest work friend among her other best friends. 

Now, I don't know how to shift your perspective to that direction but I think it can be helpful to recognize you are one of her best friends, just not *the* one and only, because she clearly has more history with Annie. In the same way that my cousin's work friend can't ever have the same intimate connection due to history that me and cousin share, I can't share the connection they have because of their unique professional experiences and physical proximity (they live next door, I live in a different city). Our friendships are different but equal in a way?

It may also help to cherish and think about your other close friendships. Maybe you will find some people who can join your ""tier"".",3450,168,2020-09-30 07:31:55,j2hohg
relationships,I(32m) am in love with my former sister inlaw(27f)," 

# I posted this inR/Relationship_advice, but it got buried and I got only three replies so looking for advice here.

TLDR at Bottom This will be a long post.

I'm  finally at a point where I can't stand this anymore. I've been in love  with this woman for a very long time, maybe a couple of years at this  point and I'm not sure if I should just kill it or attempt to make  something with her.

I met my  ex-wife, her sister, when I was 23-years-old and the relationship  developed very quickly and by 26 I had my son and daugther and had  gotten married. However, within months of being married my ex-wife had  an affair, but worse than that the man she cheated with had gotten her  into Heroin. After confronting her on this she said she was going to get  help, but instead she left in the night. I haven't heard from her in 4  years and last I've heard she's still with that guy and are homeless in  Las Vegas. Not sure how true that is, but being focused on holding it  together for the kids, I really don't have the time to chase her down,  nor do I want to after what she pulled.

I  ended up getting a divorce in absentia. I did however maintain a very  positive relationship with my inlaws after the fact. Every other weekend  my kids stay over with their grandparents on that side and they pretty  much treat me like a son still, I still go to parties at Christmas and  am reasonably liked by the family. Nobody talks about my ex anymore  mainly to not worry my kids. My oldest, my son is very hurt by his  mother leaving. He's 9 now and I've had to get therapy for him after he  told me he hoped his mother was dead. She had been getting verbally  abusive toward the end which was when he was around 5 or 6

Anyhow,  in the year following my ex leaving, her sister and my her boyfriend  had started coming around a lot to see the kids. They knew I worked a  lot and would babysit and call it practice as they wanted to have  children of their own. My kids love them and were spoiled by them, which  I didn't mind because we all needed a little positivity. They got  married and were very in love. However, her husband was killed in a  workplace accident shortly after the birth of their daughter.

It  has been extremely rough and painful for everyone involved as one can  imagine. I followed my Sil's example and began to take her daughter to  give her time to herself if things got too hard to deal with or she  needed alone time. She's been in grief counciling for a few years but  she still wears her ring and has told me she can't ever imagine dating  again. I talk to her about him frequently and she's gotten to a better  place but she's still very much in love with him, I can't imagine that  sort of pain.

Over the last two  years we've been a more constant figure in each others lives. My kids  love their aunt and I have her over for dinner a couple times a week. My  daughter and her daughter have become close and love being around each  other so they have sleepovers. I've moved on from my ex by this but the  idea of dating possibly someone dangerous as their mother has kept me  out of the dating scene.

I don't  know when it happened, but slowly I began to get soft on my SIL. She's a  great mom for what she's had happen to her. She's one of the sweetest  people I know and her sense of humor always leaves me laughing and  happy. Then I started realizing that I'm physically attracted to her.  I've always felt kind guilty about it because her late husband was a  good friend and since she's obviously is still grieving, so I've kept it  to myself.

Since Covid started  we've been together a bit more because social distancing has had us lose  contact with most other people. Nothing romantic has ever been  discussed and I try not to flirt, but last week it was very late and  after the kids went to bed I made us a few drinks, not enough to get  drunk but she decided she'd rather spend the night, so I took my couch. I  woke up to breakfast this morning and the four of us felt like the sort  of family I've always wanted. She even kissed my forehead which is not  something she normally does. I still didn't say anything, but after she  left I found my son quietly playing with his toys in his room. He looked  upset so I asked him if he was alright.

He  tells me point blank in the way only a kid can that he wishes Sil was  his mother. I sat down with him and asked him why he thought that way  and he gave a whole bunch of reasons her being nice to him, that she  never yells about anything. He likes seeing her at his grandparents and  she draws pictures with him, which I didn't know they did. By the end of  it my heart that is already melting for this woman even more wound up.

When  visiting dropping them off with their grandparents, I tried to breach  the subject with her folks to kinda feel around how people would see. I  made a joke about she and I acting like a married couple sometimes and  they didn't laugh and were kind of stand offish, friendly but either  they know something or they disapprove.

It's  getting too hard for me to ignore or pretend it's not getting to me.  I'm in love with her. Either I've got to kill it and find some way not  to think of her, or I have to find some sort of way to navigate through  this situation and tell her everything. If anybody out there has any  insight on how to approach a widow, especially one who was married to a  friend, with this sort of intention I could really use your help.

TLDR-  Sil and I became close after my divorce to her sister and death of her  husband. She's great with my kids. I'm in love and don't know how to  proceed.","Some thoughts:

1.  Don‚Äôt make a joke of this to her.  She‚Äôs fragile enough that it‚Äôll feel in turns both threatening and confusing for her.  

2.  Clearly she‚Äôs happy with the arrangement you guys have, a sort of ersatz nuclear family which carries little emotional demands and high rewards for both of you ie your kids get the love and structure they need from two adults who care for them and each other sans the drama.  Not to mention each of you playing Mum and Dad creates that polarity which enhances a possible attraction.

3.  So I must ask this:  Are you absolutely sure you‚Äôre in love with her as a woman?  I mean, forget the convenience and comfort of it all- just her as an individual, would you have chosen her without all of this going on? 

4.  I ask because as soon as the shock wears off, she‚Äôs going to wonder if it‚Äôs that or if there‚Äôs real substance to your feelings.  No one wants to feel like a stand in and it will confuse her in the sense that she‚Äôll have to start questioning herself as to if this is something she wants in general ie dating again, if you‚Äôre what she wants or if you‚Äôre just convenient, all those feelings of disloyalty to her now gone husband will be A LOT of emotion for her to deal with.

5.  Which brings me to your expectations.  This is an ‚Äúover the fullness of time‚Äù situation.  Unlike your ex, her former husband has now been idealized for perpetuity. He will never do any wrong, he will never be less to her, and he will always reign first in her heart.  A love halted before its time and shrouded in grief can become a safe space for someone - as at least she can always say, I was married once, I did have that once - and depending where she is in her grief, she may choose to stay there for a very long time and not go further.  

Whereas you, whilst hurt by your ex‚Äô betrayal, are probably thanking your lucky stars she peaced out - no one wants the chaos of addiction around their kids.  So your grief is different, you were left behind due to human flaw, and have been much too busy caring for your children.

So while you share the state of being abandoned, each of your grief is personal and different.  You will forever be second to the man who‚Äôs gone before you and I hope you can accept that.  

More to the point, you cannot launch this on her and expect a simple yes or no.  That‚Äôs irresponsible.

If you want to prove to her that you are the man she believes you are, you‚Äôre going to have to think steps ahead.

6.  That means, you need to start getting more personal time with her without the pressure of a proposal to be romantic with each other.  Declaring it poses an unnecessary immediacy when I don‚Äôt see a need - neither of you are rushing to date other people.

You need time alone with her just to hang out and talk without the kids always around you.  Don‚Äôt ask her out formally, just carefully position yourself by getting time together like maybe stopping by and dropping off her fave coffee.  

There‚Äôs obviously some danger here of being friend zoned but the trick to that is not to allow her to treat you like a gf.  Just short bursts of personal time with intentional acts of attention, like if it‚Äôs Mother‚Äôs Day get her flowers, then joke ‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre not my Mum, but I‚Äôm so impressed by how you are with the kids that I just had to get you this.‚Äù  If that extends to a deeper conversation, say something like, ‚Äúyou being how you are makes me really think of who I should have in my life‚Äù.  

Always leave it a bit short on details to give her a chance to pursue it or leave it. 

Then the next time just give her flowers for no reason. 

Now she will either suss that this is getting romantic and will show you if she‚Äôs uncomfortable with it, OR she‚Äôs going to start looking at you and going hmmmm. 

7.  Here‚Äôs why I suggest this:  like it or not, you guys are actually good for your kids together.  And the potential of losing that just because she‚Äôs not where you are romantically, or worse, she may react negatively out of panic, is well - not really something you want. 

8.  I agree with ppl saying don‚Äôt run it by your in laws.  It‚Äôs not their concern right now and it may even be a non starter.  Who knows right? 

9.  As more time passes you‚Äôll be able to tell if she‚Äôs more open or not, and that‚Äôs when you go full court press.  Even if she turns you down, you‚Äôve gained enough information about her and how she feels about being romantically involved that you‚Äôll likely be able to talk about your options together more comfortably.  

10.  Obviously, follow all caution not to be neutered in her eyes.  A lot of that you can help by keeping the polarity electric, meaning do things that keep each of you in that state of awareness of your maleness vs her femaleness.  I sound like a douche but I don‚Äôt know how else to put it.  

But here‚Äôs an ex.  I know when a guy‚Äôs interested in me if he mentions how much he makes or does something overtly manly.  Once I was on holiday in the Seychelles and the very married son of the pensione owner took one look at me and decided he would fling his shirt off and chop wood right in front of my breakfast window.  I was literally a captive audience.  I wasn‚Äôt going to pursue it by any stretch, but it was his version of hey babe.  Like seriously he went through an entire tree trunk, it was amusing and flattering.

I wish you luck OP, I get where you‚Äôre coming from and I don‚Äôt think this is impossible.  I just think you have to be very careful to see things from her perspective and walk that fine line between gentle and exciting.

PS if this works I‚Äôll expect an invite to the wedding.",3433,28,2020-08-29 01:09:39,iijj64
relationships,"My dad (74) trashed my apartment. I want to kick him out, but my wife says she thinks it's ""not the right thing to do"".","Recently my wife and I went on a vacation for two weeks. We're lucky that in our country, COVID has been kept at bay, so travelling within the country is pretty easy.

My dad lives in our apartment.  He doesn't pay rent. While we were away, he continued living there. Upon our return, the place had pretty much been trashed.

There were fast food wrappers all over the floor, in the living room and bedrooms. Dirty shirts (several of them mine) being washed in the kitchen sink. Toilets in the bathrooms clogged up. One of the windows was left open during a rainstorm, letting rainwater in. Open condiment jars and cold cuts left out. Moldy food on the stove. A dozen half-finished coffees everywhere. Laundry just thrown on the floor in the living room. Appliances that were working perfectly fine before we left broken.

He is actually in good shape mentally, but he's just always been a slob.

This isn't the first time he's abused our space. He refuses to live by my rules, even though the house is in my name. A while back, he allowed his friends to use our home as a meeting place. When one of them started trying to recruit people for a MLM, I said that the party was over and that I wanted everyone off my property.  I called the cops and unfortunately in the heat of the moment, I lost my temper in front of them by saying if f the cops didn't remove them from my property, I would do so with force.  My dad then got upset with me because I had ""disrespected"" his friends and made him look bad.

I talked to my wife about it, and while she acknowledges that my dad is a slob and a hoarder, she doesn't want to kick him out because he gave us money towards the home for our wedding.  She said that if something happened to him it would weigh on her conscience if she sided with me in asking him to leave.

TL;DR - Dad trashed my apartment and I want him to leave.  Wife said she feels bad about asking him to leave because dad gave us some money to buy the house and because of the risk of something happening to him.","Things that arent signs of a slob: leaving windows open for days  during a rain storm, washing clothes in the sink and leaving them there, leaving out sandwich making stuff for days, clogging multiple toilets in a short time frame and leaving them(he is forgetting to flush and just reusing the same water without flushing), thinking MLMers are your friends.

He needs to be evaluated for dementia.

Edit: these are all signs of starting a task, forgetting what you are doing, and abandoning it.",3400,145,2020-12-29 17:35:45,kmiu1k
relationships,Husband (23M) has been paying for girls only fans.,"My husband (23M) and I (22F) have been married for 2 years. Recently I found out he was paying for onlyfans through his bank account (we have a joint account and I check our account often because I like to track our expenses) 

When I confronted him about it he told me his friend had asked him if he could use his card because he couldn‚Äôt use his own personal one, I never in a million years thought my husband would pay for such thing so I stupidly believed him. 

Fast forward a month later and I see the same payments, once again I confront him and yet again he said it‚Äôs his friend‚Äôs account so I told him to text his friend and ask him to send him the money that was charged, turns out he was lying about letting his friend use his card. 

I end up finding the entire truth (by myself because I couldn‚Äôt believe anything he said) turns out he had been paying for girl‚Äôs nudes and not only that he personally knows 2 of those girls and I know 1 of the 2. He spent $50 paying difference girls for subscriptions. 

TL;DR He has had an onlyfans account since around June 2019 and he had also told me he didn‚Äôt know any of the girls which wasn‚Äôt true.

EDIT: I would like to add that I myself am not huge on watching porn, I probably haven‚Äôt watched much or at all since we got married I just didn‚Äôt feel the need to so I don‚Äôt know much about how it works. Some of you were nice enough to educate me that it‚Äôs better for him to pay than to watch free stolen content and I would like to say I 100% agree. I hadn‚Äôt seen it that way but I get what you guys mean and I‚Äôm sorry if I offended anyone. Not for this relationship because he obviously is a liar but maybe for the next I will be willing to sit down and talk to whomever I‚Äôm with about porn expenses. I am still not okay with the lying and paying for people he personally knows which is why I will not be going back to him. Again thank you for the clarification!","You're young, get a divorce and you'll find someone who has their eyes on you one day, it's up to you since i am just a stranger but this isn't gonna change and this is the first and only thing i could think of to fix this, good luck!",3353,123,2020-05-27 20:35:18,grrrnt
relationships,My (30M) Fianc√©e (29F) has discovered a new love of cooking and made me her unwilling sous chef,"So, my fianc√©e has taken up cooking during quarantine. Previously, we did not cook much and instead ate out a lot. We could afford it and are generally healthy eaters. Of course, we both CAN cook but given how busy we are it was easier to eat out. Also to be honest, I don't really enjoy cooking and see it as a chore to be avoided. I love food but there are other things I'd rather do with my time.

Due to quarantine, my fianc√©e has decided to actually cook more and she has found she really enjoys it. This is great! I'm happy for her that she's discovered a new thing that brings her joy. Turns out she's also quite good at it and cares about learning new skills, etc., so I've been benefiting as well.

I still don't really care to cook myself like I said, so in return for her putting all this effort into cooking I've been helping out by paying for take out on nights she doesn't want to cook as well as doing all the dishes and cleaning the counters, etc. for the days when she does cook. As far as I was aware she agreed that this was a suitable compromise, and of course if she felt it was unfair I would have been happy to pick up the slack in other ways. But she seemed to be happy with this.

As her cooking experiments expanded to baking and generally became more elaborate, she started to rope me into cooking. I'd head to the kitchen to get a drink and check on her and she'd be like, ""oh can you help me chop this while I saute this..."" or something. I would chop some carrots for her or whatever and chat with her about the meal and then head back to whatever I was doing. I didn't mind this at all.

But it has slowly grown into me becoming her sous chef, especially when she wants to make meals that are really easier with two people. Keep in mind her cooking experiments are elaborate and sometimes take two or more hours. So my entire evening is gone to these cooking endeavors and this happens multiple times a week. On top of that, she tends to order me around in the kitchen and can be a little rude. 

As you can probably predict we had a fight about it. I told her that I dislike her attitude in the kitchen when I help, and I don't like cooking to begin with. I would feel better about helping her if she wasn't so rude to me. But quite frankly, I don't want to spend 8+ hours every week cooking. It is not MY hobby, it's hers. If she wanted me to pitch in by providing meals, I would buy them or make something simple. 

She was very upset. She said that it wasn't fair that I was enjoying the fruits of her labor but not contributing, and that cooking took 2 hours but doing the dishes/cleaning only took half an hour. I told her that it was her decision to make very elaborate meals and that I would be happy if she put together a simple pizza or stir fry. After a certain point, the elaborateness of her meals crosses into hobby territory and I resent being made to feel like I'm a bad partner because I don't want to give up multiple evenings to HER hobby.

We did not really resolve this. I actually bought/made some of my own meals on a few nights so I wasn't ""enjoying the fruits of her labor"" but this seemed to make her more upset and our fridge started to fill with more leftovers than she could eat herself. Another time I ended up helping her but told her I needed to go to a videochat at 8 pm, and she got upset when I actually stopped helping to leave even though I'd told her beforehand. I told her a little snappishly, I'm afraid, that I wasn't her sous chef to boss around in the kitchen.

I tried to discuss this with her again when we were feeling calmer. I told her that I loved that she found a new hobby but it is HER hobby and I can't help with it and don't want to feel obligated to do so. She retorted that it wasn't feminist of me to relegate the cooking to her and benefit from it without helping. The feminism connection makes little sense to me because previously neither of us cooked much and she chose to take up cooking herself, but of course I didn't tell her that. I told her that if she wants to discuss the distribution of labor in our house we can do so and come up with something new that reflects that she's cooking more now. 

We tried to do this but she wanted to count ALL the time she spends cooking as ""chore time."" So according to her ideal chore distribution, she spends 10+ hours cooking DINNER ONLY every week, which somehow leaves me with pretty much all the rest of the chores. I told her I wasn't happy with this, because making elaborate meals is a hobby. It isn't fair that say, 6/10 hours of her ""chores"" is actually her hobby, and I have to do an equivalent amount of actual chores, if that makes sense.

So we're at a bit of an impasse. Am I actually being a bad feminist? I don't think I am wrong (I am quite familiar with emotional labor, mental load, all that) but maybe I am. I love this woman and obviously want to marry her but we're usually good at making decisions logically and this is the first time we've had such a disagreement. I don't know how to get her to understand the boundary between cooking as a necessary activity and cooking as a hobby. I would appreciate your advice.

**TL;DR: Fianc√©e has taken up cooking elaborate meals as a hobby but now it's becoming an obligation for me to help and do more chores than I think I should.**","I don‚Äôt have any actual advice, just, I‚Äôve been there. I like to cook and sometimes very elaborate meals and it took me a long time to realize that my family was actually happier with the simple meals. I‚Äôd get so stressed over making some fancy thing, and then right when we are about to eat there‚Äôs some minor disagreement and I felt like dinner was ruined after spending hours on it. I‚Äôm not sure what anyone could have said to me to make me realize it sooner though so sorry if this isn‚Äôt much help. I make a lot more pizza and hamburgers these days.",3272,229,2020-06-09 00:03:52,gzblnk
relationships,"UPDATE: Me 45F with my 47M, 22 years, ED the whole time, viagra stopped working.","I posted this https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7wv3oo/i_43f_am_struggling_with_my_husband_45m_of_20/

2 years ago, and I finally remembered the user name and can give an update.

Guess which couple hasn't been having sex during the quarentine? Us.

After reading everyone's advice, I convinced my husband to go get a testosterone test.  It came back normal.  We are in the same postion, only it is so much worse, so much lonlier, and I am in counseling so I can start feeling ready to leave.


1. I got some toys to have better sex. Now that's all he wants to do is use those on me.  It honestly is just like him helping me masturbate, which I do just fine.


2. He wants me to just tell him when I am ready, like - hey, I want to have sex. And then he uses the toys on me. It feels sort of degrading to me, like - if you have an itch, tell me and I'll scratch it.  


3.  He never went to see a specialist.  I have asked many times, what if it is because of something simple, maybe a specialist could find out? But no, he said it isn't worth the money.  And that feels like he is saying I am not worth the $30 copay.


4.  I am sad that I stayed married.  I feel sexually lonely. I never feel attractive or beautiful. 


5. We love each other, and in that way have a happy relationship.But it is like a long distance relationship in the same house.

UPDATE:

I have shared much of this discussion with him, thank you.  

As for the part about me not feeling beautiful, hew said we are both getting older. That conversation made me feel sadder than I already feel.

As for the question of attraction in general, he said there are women he finds attractive, but not to the point of having a crush or flirting.

As for going to a doctor and looking into other options, he laughed and said, ""my body, my choice.""

**tl;dr**: Still no sex, still sad, but now considering leaving.

relationships,UPDATE I(20f) feel like I'm at the end of my rope with my boyfriend(22m).,"Link to original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/e0k27o/i20f_feel_like_im_at_the_end_of_my_rope_with_my/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

I thought now that I'm in a much better place, I should update this. 

I broke up with my boyfriend a couple of days after this post. I didn't plan on it happening so soon, but we got into another petty fight and it escalated to the point where I told him this wasn't working. 

The petty fight was because I refused to sleep on the side of the bed away from the phone charger. In my own apartment. One time I accidentally snoozed his alarm for work and he was late. I hadn't done it again since then but he held it over my head. I'm not sure what shifted the argument but it started to be about how he works harder than me and that I don't deserve my job because it's easier than his. It then turns back to all the grudges he's held against me, as it usually does. 

After fighting for almost 4 hours, I tell him that we need to take a break. He changes his demeanor completely and then tries to tell me that he's sorry and he doesn't want to lose me. He makes promises to curb his anger issues by taking medication and going to therapy, which I've asked of him time and time again to do in the past. I wonder at this point, why does it take me breaking up with him for him to finally want to do these things?

The next day I told him that he needed to pack his things from my apartment. I left for work and he did what I asked. A couple days later I went to get my keys. He started crying and telling me that this feels like a real break up. I told him it just might be, I didn't know if I wanted to get back together with him. I still feel regretful for saying it was a break, because I gave him hope that we would possibly reconcile when I didn't intend on it. I was afraid that if I had suggested a break up right off the bat I would have gotten a more explosive reaction from him. We hugged after I got my keys and I was hoping that maybe there was a chance we could remain friends.

About two weeks after this he showed up at my apartment unannounced. I got scared and called my mom, and she hurried over. As soon as he saw her he told her that he just wanted his things. I should have seen this was a red flag because the only thing of his that remained was a hairdryer. As soon as I let them in he rushed over to my box of condoms and counted them, before saying there was one missing and running over to dig through my trashcans. He couldn't find anything and then tried to take the snake he got me for our anniversary. I stopped him from taking the snake, at this point I was sobbing and freaking out. My mom and I were yelling at him to leave or else we would call the police. After he left, I blocked him on all social media and his phone number. 

Since then I've had a mixed range of emotions, from missing him to hating him. I realize that he was abusive but I can't help but feel guilty about how things ended. I don't regret that I made the decision to break up with him, however, because a huge weight has been lifted from my shoulders. I really want to thank everyone that replied to my post because you all gave me the courage to stand up for myself and initiate the end of this relationship that was slowly destroying me. I feel so free now that I have control of my life without someone micromanaging me, and I still struggle with thoughts of him but I'm slowly but surely improving. 

Tl;dr: I broke up with my boyfriend, had some shit happen, but I'm much happier!

Edit: to clear some confusion, this happened 4 months ago, almost 5. I haven't had any contact with him since I blocked him, and I dont have any worries about it since he probably hates my guts. Thank you all for the nice comments!",Maybe change your locks since he could have copied the keys before handing them back to you. Good thing you have a supportive mother who is there for you. Hang in there. You‚Äôve got this! Things are only going to get better once you cut out the toxic people in life!,3127,73,2020-03-28 02:22:44,fqbg3y
relationships,My(23M) older sisters are trying to control my life and ruin my relationship,"I‚Äôm 23, the only son in my family, and I have 3 older sisters(27, 29, 30). They are all very opinionated, on everything. Right now they‚Äôre main focus is me and my girlfriend, of 4 months. They barrage me all day with texts and phone calls about how this woman isn‚Äôt right for me, flaws they see in her, advising me to break up, on and on. It‚Äôs weird, whenever any of them dated a guy, I never said anything, but, whenever I date, oh my god, stop the presses.

In the past, as it relates to their ‚Äú advice‚Äù, I‚Äôve tried an ‚Äú I can handle myself, thanks though‚Äù approach, they don‚Äôt listen. I‚Äôve tried, ‚Äú stfu and go away‚Äù, they get offended and but continue advising.

They hate this woman(23F) I‚Äôm with now. Personally, I‚Äôm the happiest I‚Äôve ever been in a relationship. She‚Äôs more outgoing and talkative than women I‚Äôve dated in the past, very pretty, very bubbly, very fun. They think she‚Äôs shallow, unintelligent, and image-obsessed, and I rebuke these claims all the time with them.

I just want them to stop with the snide remarks and insults. When I try and stop it, whether it‚Äôs in a text thread or call or video chat or whatever, someone‚Äôs quick to remind me of the ‚Äúpecking order‚Äù and told that ‚Äúthey have my best interests in mind‚Äù and want to see me with the ‚Äú right girl‚Äù aka one they approve of.

&#x200B;

TLDR: How can I get my older sisters to accept who I'm dating?","I'm going to give you a ""Dear Abby"" kind of answer:

You don't have to listen to this at all and the solution is to tell your sisters you don't want to hear it. Whenever they start sending you texts, ignore and delete them. Whenever they call, the moment they start digging into your GF, tell them, ""I said I won't listen to this. Thanks for calling."" and hang up the phone.

If you're in their presence and they start this, tell them, ""I told you I won't listen to this."" and leave the room. If they persist, leave the house.

This becomes a lather, rinse, repeat, until they finally get the message. If they won't stop, no matter what you do, tell them you'll break all contact with them if it continues, and mean it. They'll get the message the more you do it.

And if you have to make the hard choice to cut them off, hopefully, they'll realize they're pushing you away and apologize.

I just can't get over how much they're bombarding you with this. It's almost pathological. I wouldn't even call it protective. It's just plain nuts.",3095,213,2020-04-21 16:23:48,g5ibwx
relationships,"My (32F) Fiance (34M) walked in on my therapy session, overheard, and is perhaps upset","**\*\*EDIT: I shared an update (positive) in comments section, as 48 hours must elapse in order make a separate update post. Thank you all for the thoughtful and compassionate responses.**

Backstory: I (32F) have been with fiance (34M) for several years. I've been in therapy since 21. I am admittedly a ""work in progress"" as I always will be, though I would like to think that I try as hard as I can and have developed some strategies to utilizes when things seem to be spiraling. This has allowed me to have a stable home life, relationship turned engagement, and I've always been able to hold down a decent job.

My fiance does not have mental health issues, but often acknowledges that he wishes he was in therapy to deal with how he handles frustration and crisis situations. He has insurance, but can't seem to find the time to make an appointment for himself. He respects and is proud of me for going to therapy myself and when I become extremely anxious about situations (even about things related to our communication) he encourages me to talk about it (but not in a diminishing or gaslighting way).

Prior to COVID, I (like most others) went to see a therapist in-person. Now it happens virtually, and I actually find it more effective for some reason. When I talk about really difficult subjects I'm processing, I tend to raise my voice and cry. Fiance and I live in a small apartment and it has happened so far that he has been out of the house during my sessions, so this issue hasn't yet come up.

Today, fiance unexpectedly came home for lunch in the middle of a session. I knew that he'd come back at some point but wasn't sure exactly when. While on the phone w therapist, I was pretty viscerally upset and going off about some deeply-rooted, abuse related issues about family and ex. Fiance got home and walked towards my room to say hi and opened the door. He walked on me me speaking about something in abstract, and quickly left the room. He went into the living room and put on a podcast, maybe in an effort for me not to be worried that he was eavesdropping. So I figured he wasnt listening and continued to vent (about past resentment). Then But then I heard some shuffling outside my door in the hallway and when he coughed accidentally, it made clear how close he was. It was a super awkward situation all around and I'm not sure how I should have handled it.

He then left the apartment and I'm not sure if I upset him. I'm also wondering if I messed up by not warning him in the morning that I would be in an appointment later. I had a million other work related things to do today on the forefront of my mind. I texted him that I'm sorry I missed him, and no response for an hour.  If I did in fact upset him, not sure how/if to apologize, so any advice would be appreciated.

tldr; fiance came home unexpectedly, most likely overheard me venting about serious issues unrelated to him, left abruptly and I'm afraid I upset him","Why do you think you may have upset him? Your fiance knows you've went to therapy for years, regularly. He obviously realised you were in a session when he walked in. I don't think you did anything you need to apologize for, or anything that would've hurt your fiance.",3095,72,2020-08-26 18:46:44,ih4r1x
relationships,[UPDATE] My (M26) German coworker (F29) invited me to a sauna,"**Previous post:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/k34mi8/my\_m26\_coworker\_f29\_invited\_me\_to\_a\_sauna\_what/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/k34mi8/my_m26_coworker_f29_invited_me_to_a_sauna_what/)

Hi!

**Short recap:** My (M26) German coworker (F29) of one year, who I like and have a good friendly, slightly bantery relationship with, had excitedly invited me to go to a mixed sauna with her ""once the pandemic is over"" after she heard from me that I have never been to a sauna. I was asking for advice if this meant she may be interested in something romantic or if she may just like saunas (being German and all where nudity often isn't such a big deal).

**Update:** After trying to gather my courage over the weekend to ask her out, she told me on Monday that she has matched with someone on a dating app and was very excited to meet them and talked quite a bit about them the whole week 

I think she either never intended to indicate any romantic interest or realized over the weekend that her invitation could have been seen as something flirty, so she decided to tell me about her love life - to set the record dtraight so to speak. In either case, it seems not to have meant anything.

Regardless: Thanks a lot for the advice, it could have very well meant something else!

relationships,I [24F] don‚Äôt want to furnish a guest room for my mother [64F] in my new home.,"TL;DR 
Mom is very excited that I‚Äôm going to have a spare bedroom. I‚Äôm flooded with apprehension. I don‚Äôt know if my feelings are justified or not.
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

My partner [24M] and I are moving into a 1300 sq ft 2/2 townhome this week. Our current apartment is a snug 350 sq ft 1/1. 

I‚Äôve been working from home out of our bedroom since mid-March. This hasn‚Äôt done wonders for my mental wellbeing. Moving into a bigger place has been a light at the end of the tunnel these last few months. 

I‚Äôm particularly happy about having a second bedroom, as my partner agreed that I should turn it into my home office. (I expect to continue working from home for quite a while longer.)

In my excitement, I told both my parents all about the new place as soon as our application was approved. 

(Context on my parents: My parents are divorced. They live in my hometown, roughly an eight hour drive away.)

When I mentioned the second bedroom in the townhome to my mom, she immediately began talking about staying in ‚Äúher guest room‚Äù. I told her that I was going to turn the spare room into a home office, but she just replied ‚Äúwith a sleeper sofa!‚Äù She then began talking excitedly about how she‚Äôd be able to drive up and visit ‚Äúoften‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt know what to say, but something in my gut turned.

My mom works at an airport in a COVID hotspot. I have asthma that gets worse when I get sick, so I can‚Äôt take any chances with COVID. Knowing this, my mom has been trying for months to push me to visit her, and she‚Äôs been asking repeatedly if she can come visit me. (She has outright refused to quarantine herself for two weeks prior to seeing me.)

I put my foot down and told her that any travel was out of the question, and she kind of accepted that. She still complains about it every time we talk though, and she still asks even though she knows the answer is no. Recently, she asked me if I needed her to come visit to help me move. After that didn‚Äôt work, she asked if she could come visit in August to ‚Äúsee the new place‚Äù and celebrate her birthday. I felt guilty about saying no, so I gave a very noncommital response.

At this point, I‚Äôm not even sure if I‚Äôd want to see her even if she did quarantine for two weeks beforehand. My mom gets way too pushy when she doesn‚Äôt get her way, and it makes me very uncomfortable. The problem is, she‚Äôs also extremely giving and generous, so it makes me feel guilty denying her requests. 

She‚Äôs constantly offering to give me money I don‚Äôt need, and she tries to lend a helping hand in every situation without being asked. She has offered to pay for graduate school for me *and* pay for my living expenses, because she wants me back in school. (We had that arrangement when I was in undergrad, but the money was never as reliable as she said it would be. Having independence and a stable job has been a godsend. I‚Äôm never relying on her financially again.)

I almost think she‚Äôs generous so that she has leverage to push people around with. I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs doing it in a conscious, malicious way, though. I think she does it because having control and feeling like a good person makes her happy.

In the past, when I‚Äôve told her ‚Äúno‚Äù, she has gone straight to guilting me. 
On one occasion, she wanted to stay the night with my partner and I in our tiny little apartment. I told her that my partner‚Äôs family, who live in town, would be more than happy to have her as a guest. In fact, they had already prepared the guest room for her. She cried and said that I ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt want her‚Äù, and she basically had a meltdown. I told her we didn‚Äôt have room or an air mattress, so she‚Äôd have to sleep on the floor. I told her that this was unacceptable, and that I would not allow my mother to sleep on grubby carpet. She then threatened to drive all the way *back* home overnight, after having driven all the way *from* home that day. When we didn‚Äôt back down, she went through with the threat. I couldn‚Äôt sleep that night out of fear, worrying about her crashing the car from sleep deprivation. 

My partner has held my mother in poor regard ever since that incident. He really doesn‚Äôt want her to stay with us in the future. I could blame things on him and tell her that he‚Äôs the reason why she can‚Äôt stay with us, but that‚Äôs not fair to him. Plus, she might try to retaliate in some way, and I don‚Äôt want that.

***Actual TL;DR, after writing out my feelings:
How do I tell my mother that my home office isn‚Äôt her guest bedroom? How do I tell her that she can‚Äôt come visit me in August?

I don‚Äôt even want to have her sleeping on an air mattress in my home office, because I‚Äôm uncomfortable leaving her alone with my belongings. She has gone through my things at least once in the past.

She keeps texting me, asking me how moving is going. Every time I see her texts, I feel a mix of discomfort and guilt. It makes me want to throw my phone away. 

Reddit, please help?
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Edit: Wow, I‚Äôve never had a post receive this much attention before. 
It‚Äôs interesting how many comments I‚Äôve received guilting me for not wanting my mom to visit right now. The majority of comments were really constructive and supportive, but a noticeable minority basically told me ‚Äúyou‚Äôll miss your mom when she dies‚Äù and ‚Äúshe‚Äôs divorced and lonely and loves you, you ungrateful child‚Äù.
Here I go JADE-ing at those comments. (Good term, thank y‚Äôall for teaching it to me!)

- I‚Äôm uncomfortable around my mom because she‚Äôs completely disregarding COVID, and I am in a high-risk group. My dad‚Äôs health isn‚Äôt great either and I worry about him, as they live near one another and still see each other.
- I‚Äôm uncomfortable around my mom because she doesn‚Äôt care for LGBT people, and both my partner and I are bisexual.
- I‚Äôm uncomfortable around my mom because I went on a friendly mall date with a (gasp) non-white boy once in my teens, and she told me she ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt want a nappy-haired grandchild‚Äù.
- I‚Äôm uncomfortable around my mom because she has had a history of psychosis. When she‚Äôs under stress, she can act in ways that don‚Äôt always make sense. When I was little, it was worse, and she scared me a few times.
- I‚Äôm uncomfortable around my mom because she‚Äôs not very good with money, and she has asked me for money before. Even though she makes thousands more a month than I do. (She wanted to buy a big-ticket item, and didn‚Äôt want to save for a month to buy it.)
- I‚Äôm uncomfortable around my mom because she handled divorcing my dad really poorly, and didn‚Äôt seem to care for how I felt at all. I was twelve. She discouraged me from talking to my dad, took me away traveling on weekends I was supposed to see him, and she tried to get a restraining order on him. She had no reason to do that. She actually took me with her to court that day, and it was all I could do not to run over and hug my dad. I think I did hug him, actually, and he had to tell me it wasn‚Äôt allowed. He and I were so close before the divorce, and we‚Äôre still trying to fix our relationship.
- I‚Äôm uncomfortable around my mom because she didn‚Äôt step in or do anything when I was in an emotionally abusive relationship with an adult male as a teenage girl. He was 22, and I was 16, and she let him sleep in her house. Of course I thought it was a good idea at first, but I was in too deep very quickly. He was coercive, mean, and selfish. I needed my mom to step in and act like a parent, maybe by kicking him out and forbidding me from seeing him. Instead, she enabled the whole thing. I had to ‚Äúbreak up‚Äù with this man, and that was only after he tried to coerce me into marrying him.
- I‚Äôm uncomfortable with my mom because she always wants me to approve of her bad decisions, and gets angry when I don‚Äôt.
- I‚Äôm uncomfortable around my mom because when she saw that I was anxious as a little kid, she forced pills on me and took me to a psych ward (completely unprompted, I was discharged the same day). When I got ‚Äúbetter‚Äù after gaining some independence, I told her that I stopped taking the pills because they made me feel sick. She then freaked out and told me I needed to take them, or I‚Äôd get anxious again and ‚Äúlose everything‚Äù that I‚Äôd built. I‚Äôve been trying to make myself ‚Äúwell‚Äù for years. But I‚Äôve never lost control of my life since I got it.
- I‚Äôm uncomfortable around my mom because she  wants me to get married and have her grandchildren, but I would never want her to influence any child I ever had.

But yes. I‚Äôm guilty. Bad and ungrateful child. Going to regret having boundaries when she dies. For sure. (Shame about all the time I missed with my dad that I‚Äôll never get back when *he* dies, but yeah.)

I may not be sure how to have a healthy relationship with my mom, but acquiescing to guilt isn‚Äôt it, chief. Thanks tho.","Boundaries, boundaries, boundaries! (check out r/raisedbynarcissists or r/justnoMIL for some info and tips from those in your shoes on setting boundaries with unhealthy family members)

Every time you give an inch, she takes a mile. Why do you think she's so ""generous"" and wants to pay for everything? Because then you're dependent on her and/or you ""owe"" her and it's harder to say no to someone who's paying your rent/tuition/etc.

I'd start by telling her the truth and establishing the boundary at the same time: ""Mom, I've been thinking about our conversation regarding your birthday and I'm just not comfortable with you coming to visit next month and I'm not sure when I will be due to the virus and my health issues. I need you to know that your repeated requests to visit have felt like pressure at best and manipulative at worst, and whether intentional or not I can't continue to worry about having to tell you ""no"" all the time. Moving forward, I will have to end our conversations and hang up if you insist on bringing up these topics or discussing them when I've made it clear I'm not interested.""

Then follow through: if she asks to visit, lays on the guilt-trip, or pressures you then just hang up the phone/zoom call/stop responding to the texts.",3081,156,2020-07-28 18:46:06,hzkdbw
relationships,My (27f) boyfriend (23m) tried to throw out our bed so he could play a video game,"Me and my boyfriend have been living together for about a year now and for a while he's been really interested in virtual reality. Now the problem is that our tiny studio apartment isn't big enough to jump around in. He knows this, I know this, and we've had multiple conversations about how it's a shame we don't live in some huge house where we could dedicate an entire room to something like that.

I went out yesterday for a walk and a picnic yesterday and came back to my boyfriend dismantling our bed. I assumed something had broken and asked what had happened. Nothing was broken. He'd managed to order an oculus quest headset and had made the executive decision that we could swap our double bed for a Japanese futon??

There is no fucking room for this. Even if we lived on the ground floor (which we don't), and I was willing to sleep on the floor (which I'm not), the room just isn't big enough. It would dominate the entire room. Am I supposed to crouch in the kitchen whilst he plays? Our entire home is being compromised for what is effectively a video game.

I honestly don't really know what to say. He thinks he's being entirely reasonable to do this without involving me. I don't even know what to say to him here since the whole thing seems so ridiculous and he's so obviously being unreasonable yet is oblivious and keeps saying I'll really enjoy vr and it'll all be worth it. I told him I was worried he'll damage the TV or my art supplies and he is convinced it won't be a problem as they have sensors for that.

I love my boyfriend and he's always been entirely reasonable and level headed until now and we always discuss everything. How do I get through to him about this? If it wasn't so difficult right now I'd be considering moving out or leaving. I told him I'd throw it out the window when it arrived unless he was going to sit down and have a serious conversation about this but he just won't take anything I say seriously. 

TL;DR My boyfriend bought a vr headset and wants to remove our bed to play it in our tiny studio apartment and can't see this is unreasonable.",Tell him he better be able to get a virtual girlfriend on it to sleep on the floor with him,3060,189,2020-07-15 14:02:32,hro3xn
relationships,My (55m) son (25m) is mad that I'm giving my daughter (30f) control of my company. My wife (53f) and I don't know what to do.,"Throwaway cause my son follows account and is actually the one who set it up.

Background: I met my wife when I was studying overseas when I was 27. She was 25 at that time with a 2 year old daughter. She was, and to this day is, a damn good artist and a middle school art teacher. Her brother was my first friend overseas and still is one of my best friends and I met my wife when he invited me for Christmas dinner with his family. I have no idea what she saw in a broke college student in his late 20s but I thank my lucky stars she gave me a chance. Two years later we were married and a year after that, at 30, we had our son... Our second child. I adopted her daughter shortly after we were married and I love her to death. She's always been a daddy's girl and no matter what anyone says, she's mine. Despite the fact that she's very white and I'm as Asian as they come haha. 

I eventually graduated and landed a job as a financial analyst in a pretty big company. I busted my ass off at work and when I wasn't at work I was busy trading in the stock market. After a couple of years, good investments, and a lot of loans, I took a leap of faith and quit my job to start my own company. 

When my daughter was 14 and my son was 9, I started making seven figures a year from what I earned from the company and my several investments. I slowed down after that and cut my hours a bit, so I'd be more involved in my children's lives. 

Since my daughter was young, she's always shown interest in business. She'd spend her Saturdays with me in my company and wanted to learn all about it. I offered to take my son too but he wasn't interested and wanted to be an artist like his mother. 

Now I just want to clarify that I was very involved in both my children's lives. I make it a point to talk to both of them over dinner almost every night. One of my son's first portrait, which was of me and my wife, still hangs in my office at work. 

Because of this, I've always groomed my daughter to be my successor. She's the one who always took interest in running my company one day and even studied in a prestigious business school. My son studied art in Italy. 

Now, I know every parent says this but my daughter is a genius when it comes to business. She works (or at least worked) in a big international company based in Europe before coming home last year to work with me in mine, where she has plans to scale it to even greater heights (it's still not a very big company). And this is where the problem starts. 

My wife and I are about to retire (early, I know) to travel the world. She's never been into luxury items, unlike me, but she does love to travel. 

So we sat our children down and announced that we were retiring early and that they'd be getting some of their inheritance soon (I wanted to sort out my estate very early to avoid problems for them when I'm gone). 

The moment I said ""daughter will be taking my place in the company"" my son was livid. He started accusing me of favoritism, being a useless dad, and his sister of manipulating me into giving it to her and leaving him with nothing. My wife tried to calm him down but he stormed out, but not before yelling ""she's not even your real daughter anyway!"". 

I didn't know how to feel after that. It was a mix of pain, anger, regret, and a whole lot of other stuff. I was hurt by some of the things he said, angry about how he said his sister wasn't my daughter, and regret cause somehow I feel like I've failed him as a father. I wasn't even finished explaining how things would go. 

I hugged my daughter, who was crying, and reassured her that I loved her so much while my wife tried to get a hold of our son. 

I tried to be a good father to him. I paid for his international education, attended all his art events, and even introduced him to some of my friends that were into art. I made sure to take him on father-son trips too every couple of months. It never occurred to me that he was ever remotely jealous of his sister being my apprentice, despite the fact that I did try to take him with us when we went to work. 

Also, I never planned on giving one child more than the other. My daughter was only taking over running the company, but the ownership would've been 55/45, so my son would still own part of the company. I own 3 condos in the city, 2 of which are occupied by my children (which they would keep) and the 3rd would've went to my son to make up for giving his sister more equity in the company. He would've also kept my watch collection, which I promised to him at a young age. Both kids would've got a substantial amount of money too. My current home would still be mine to rent out, and I'm keeping my stocks, so Id still have some money coming in to fund our travels. 

Now I don't know how to go on from here. I'm set to retire after this pandemic is sorted and its safe to travel. It's been a week and my son still won't answer his mother's call. I'm still mad about how he acted but I still want him to be part of our lives. My daughter even offered to give him everything if it would make him happy but I shut that down immediately. I worked hard for BOTH my children. 

How do I proceed? Part of me wants to call but I know we'd just get into another screaming match cause the things he said still hurt me. That's if he even answers my call. I don't think I did anything wrong here, but if I did, please tell me so I can fix it. My wife is beside me right now and she's still trying to reach our son but no luck. 

Any advice would be helpful

TL/DR: I told my kids my daughter would take my place in my business. Son was livid before hearing the whole story. He said a few hurtful things and now we're both mad at each other.

Edit: I don't think this part was clear. My son never heard how I was going to split my assets and ownership of the company. He only heard the part where I said my daughter was taking my place before he went ballistic.

Edit 2: My son doesn't fully rely on my money. He lives in my condo and I paid for his car but he makes his own money and his work sells. He's very passionate about art and is very good at it.","Personally, I don‚Äôt think you did anything wrong. It sounds like you were very thoughtful in your succession plan and it sounds very fair. If anything, it sounds somewhat skewed towards your son as your daughter would be putting all the work into the business and he would simply profit from her work.

I think your son is behaving quite spoiled.

In your shoes, I would just send him a note to let him know that you weren‚Äôt done explaining his things would be split and to let you know when he‚Äôs ready to talk about it.

You actually don‚Äôt owe either of your children any inheritance. Any penny you give them is very generous and kind - but your money is yours to spend as you wish.

I think he is behaving in quite the entitled way, and IMO, I don‚Äôt think you should play into it.",3056,201,2020-06-11 10:55:01,h0x2ck
relationships,[Update] My SO [f22] of 7 years cheated on me [m22] with a close friend,"[Previous Post] (https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/f0o64z/my_so_f22_of_7_years_cheated_on_me_m22_with_one/)

Thank you for all the comments, my post didnt get a whole lot of traction, but I figured I'd post an update anyway.

We're broken up, I'm trying to organize a trip to see some friends next weekend. I'm not really sure what to do before then, I haven't eaten much or slept much. I've never been this alone before. I had someone to talk to for the last 7 years. Some friends reached out to me, which was nice. And I didnt cry at work. But I'm still all alone in a city that I know no-one in and this is all starting to seem like the worst case scenario for the end of a relationship. I guess I have to learn to deal with this now.

----------------------

Tl;dr I'm single and miserable. Less miserable than if I had stayed with a cheater, but still miserable.

Edit: damn this got a lot more attention than my last post. Thank you everyone for the kind words. I've been leaning heavy on my support network, my brother is coming down this weekend. I'll survive. Thank you for the suggestions and words of encouragement, even from total strangers it means a lot.",It doesn't seem like it now but it only gets better from here man. This experience will only make you a stronger person.,3051,137,2020-02-10 22:51:07,f1yjd8
relationships,Final Update: My (19F) bf (22M) doesn't trust me anymore. How can i get him to trust me again?,"Oh my gosh, thank you for the awards everyone. I feel overwhelmed. I‚Äôm so honoured by everyone telling me their stories, I‚Äôm saving this post forever to look at if I ever think I should go back. 
It‚Äôs crazy that strangers on the internet have showed me more support in two months than my ex (that feels weird to say lol) boyfriend has in a year is crazy! Thank you kind reddit friends for making my day. 
Oh, everyone is saying I should block him. I think I‚Äôm going to listen the first time this time and do it! i never thought of that but it‚Äôs probably safer for me and my growth... thank you again to everyone, I love you all!

tl;dr: i broke up with my emotionally abusive bf.


Hi everyone. I posted this almost two months ago, this is been the worst year of my life (with most people I‚Äôd imagine lol) and these past two months have been hard too. I just wanted to update and say I broke up with him yesterday. After having a month of space from him i realise that I can‚Äôt be in a relationship where I feel like nothing I do is good enough, bc I‚Äôm just not good enough for him and I never will be. Idk if anyone would ever be good enough for him tbh. The thought of being single is really scary, and I do feel empty and I do think i‚Äôll always live him, but for my sake i think it‚Äôs for the best it ended. Being without him is better than constantly feeling bad for just existing, i think.

Honestly, the scariest thing is before I posted I didn‚Äôt even think anything was particularly wrong about our relationship. And I thought if it was it was my fault bc it couldn‚Äôt be his. 

So I just wanted to thank the people of this subreddit for waking me up. I was in denial at first but you guys were right. I‚Äôm so thankful for everyone who helped me. 

Stay safe everyone 
<3",Thanks for the update. So glad you have recognized that you deserve to be treated with respect even though being single is scary. Take time to be proud of yourself for making the hard choice.,3016,106,2020-10-29 10:44:54,jk7rde
relationships,"It seems people are not very interested in keeping me in their lives, and I [26F] am not sure why","I used to be a very shy and socially awkward kid and never had many friends growing up. However in my teenage years I had a 'glowup' and developed more and more social skills and nowadays I have no social anxiety anymore and find it generally easy to meet and talk to new people. I feel like I am generally liked and I don't feel excluded.

However, there is a thing I've noticed which is that friendships don't seem to stick around a lot of the time. By that I mean, people that I've met and then don't see them that often anymore for some reason, don't seem interested in staying in contact. For example old coworkers. In my first job people hung out in private a lot and we all got along awesomely. However after I left, noone tried to stay in contact with me. I tried to keep it up somewhat but it fizzled out eventually. I know however that some people from that job are still friends to this day and meet, whereas I have not seen or heard from anyone from there in years. 

And that is just one example, but that seems to be how it goes usually. I have one friend who has been around for 7 years which is great, but apart from that, I have a hard time finding people who really want to stick around, if you know what I mean? It's like when I'm part of a friend group I seem liked and don't feel like they value me less than the others, but then when someone would have to make an effort to keep me in their lives they just don't. And I compare it to what I see from other people. For example I was pretty tight with a few people in high school, so about 8 years ago. I know that they or at least some of them are still close friends, while I have not heard anything from any of them since.. well 8 years.

Any advice? Am I just unlucky or is it something about me?

___


**tl,dr:** It seems like even people who like me don't try hard to stay in my life, and I don't have many lasting friendships. Anything I can do about that?","Honestly sounds pretty normal based on your one example. For instance, I‚Äôm very friendly and outgoing at work and have a lot of work friends. Occasionally we‚Äôll hang out together outside of work, but generally these people are all work friends, not friend-friends. I‚Äôve been working professionally for five years now and I‚Äôve only become true friends with one person from work. Around coworkers, no matter how close you are at work, there‚Äôs [generally] always a layer of professionalism that‚Äôs there preventing me from truly being my realest self the way I am around my actual friends.

Remember friendships are a two way street. You have to put in effort to maintain that relationship, but just as much, that person has to as well. But not everyone is willing to do that, especially as we get older.

Keep being yourself and hopefully you‚Äôll find more real, genuine friends.",3010,195,2020-03-23 21:02:31,fnrw1q
relationships,I [17M] think my uncle/guardian [50sM] is afraid to tell me he‚Äôs gay.,"My parents died when I was younger so my uncle raised me, mostly on his own. When I was younger he was engaged to a woman but that was about it. Obviously for a long time I didn‚Äôt think about it as a kid but when I got older I started thinking he might be gay.

There‚Äôs also this guy ‚ÄúJohn.‚Äù I don‚Äôt know him that well but like he‚Äôs visited us 1-2 times a year over the years even though we live on the opposite coast. We‚Äôll usually hang out all three of us like at a movie or my uncle will get tickets for something, but he and John will spend time together too. There‚Äôs just this weird vibe between them. Sometimes I don‚Äôt know why they‚Äôre friends because they don‚Äôt like laugh or talk about the good old days with each other, my uncle is kind of uptight around him. They just seem to talk alone a lot.

I‚Äôve also noticed that when we see my grandparents my uncle will never be like ‚Äúoh my friend John is spending the weekend with us.‚Äù And this is really embarrassing but John does this thing where he sends out a little email newsletter to my grandparents and older relatives with like pictures and updates, but I‚Äôve noticed John is never mentioned there either.

The other day I had his phone for something and I noticed a ton of messages between him and John, I didn‚Äôt see anything but the last few texts but just noticed the conversation was really large. But then he saw me looking and took his phone back and didn‚Äôt say anything. I knew he knew I‚Äôd seen it so I said something like ‚ÄúOh it‚Äôs cool that you talk, how do you know each other again‚Äù and he gave me a vague answer. And I‚Äôve been thinking about it since that happened and realized I don‚Äôt even know that much about John. I think he might have a daughter and he‚Äôs like showed me some of his hobbies but I don‚Äôt know anything about like his life or how he knows my uncle. And like it's weird for him to fly 3k miles multiple times per year to visit in-person, right?

Would it be weird to say something to my uncle? I feel bad and even though we live in a liberal area, our family is semi-religious with lots of older relatives. I feel like I want him to know that I support him specifically. Because sometimes people say they‚Äôre fine with LGBTQ people but then they don‚Äôt really mean it. And I know it‚Äôs his choice but it also kind of bugs me that he doesn‚Äôt feel like he can share his own life with me, I‚Äôm 17 not 7.

**TL;DR: I think my uncle might be gay. Should I talk to him about it?**","It seems to me that even if your uncle is gay, which IMO is pretty likely but far from certain, that would only be only one aspect of the true answer to the question of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the deal with your uncle and John?‚Äù Don‚Äôt take this the wrong way, but my gut feeling is that if he hasn‚Äôt explained whatever is going on with the two of them yet, there‚Äôs probably some aspect to it that would be hard to understand for someone who hasn‚Äôt experienced adult life, and I would urge you not to push him on it. 

Having said that, it would probably be a good idea to make a point of being supportive of the LBGTQ community to show that you wouldn‚Äôt react negatively if someone in your life came out to you.",3002,82,2020-11-16 16:31:00,jv9s89
relationships,My (28F) boyfriend (32M) told me a ‚Äúwhite lie‚Äù for almost 3 years and I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äòs a red flag,"
TL;DR: my boyfriend of almost 3 years told me a series of ‚Äúwhite lies‚Äù that to me, seem more serious. Can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm overreacting or if this is actually indicative of a bigger problem.  

I‚Äôll try to make this as short as possible but it‚Äôs going to be long as hell because there is so much lying going on. My boyfriend and I have been dating for almost 3 years, living together for 2. We have a pretty good relationship, obviously with ups and downs but we make it work and are happy. 

A little background on me/my boyfriend for context: 

I come from a single-parent home. My father was absent. My mother was/is by no means perfect, but she did her best with what she had. We were poor. Life was never easy for us but we had each other. Since I was pretty young, I‚Äôve wanted to pay her back someday. I‚Äôve worked incredibly hard to be able to do so. I help her financially as much as I can and regularly pay her bills/send her cash. I‚Äôm also her only living child now as my brother passed away 5 years ago which basically left me to help her. I don‚Äôt care, I love my mother, and the right thing to do is to help her when she needs it. But is is stressful. 

This is relevant because my boyfriend described coming from a somewhat similar past, and it is something we have bonded over. Having the mutual experiences seemed to bring us closer. He told me he also helped his parents financially, and we would often vent to each other about the stress it brings. I am not one to confide in many people, so having someone who I felt like actually understood me, was meaningful to me. 


So here is where the lies come in and I need someone to either tell me I‚Äôm not crazy and this is fucked up, or that I am crazy and this isn‚Äôt a huge deal. I‚Äôm fine with either. 

When we met, my boyfriend lived in a condo in a pretty swanky part of the city (I live in the US northeast). He told me he owned that apartment/condo. I found this to be interesting/odd because he was 28 at the time and I know this property is upwards of $650,000 on the low end and he was in an entry-level job for only like 2 yrs so the numbers just didn‚Äôt really add up. Whatever, maybe he‚Äôs good at saving? 

But then, since living together, I never once saw a piece of mail for a mortgage payment, electric bill, taxes, nothing. Not for 2 whole years. Very odd.

Also, when we started living together, he didn‚Äôt have his room rented out in the former apartment yet so he was still responsible for that portion of the rent. He would send a Venmo payment to his mother on the first of every month for his portion. I don‚Äôt own property, but I can‚Äôt think of a scenario where I would Venmo my mother to pay the mortgage on a property I supposedly own. Getting more odd. 

He would then go to his parents house for an afternoon and come back really upset. Usually when I would ask why, it was because they were having financial problems and he needed to help them out. I totally understood this and supported him. He literally has cried on my shoulder about this many times. 

He tried to start a company years back and ended up getting into debt somehow. He told me this debt was $17,000 and that he paid it off. I‚Äôm confused because I met him only 2-3 years after the supposed debt accrued/company dissolved and it was already paid off? He told me when he moved back home after the business failed, he was $17k in debt and living at his parents house working at a minimum wage job. How someone with a minimum wage job pays off that much debt in 3 years, I‚Äôll never know!

We got into a fight a few weeks ago and I finally had enough and confronted him about these things. Long story short - he doesn‚Äôt help his parents, they actually pay his phone bill, and this was all a lie. He doesn‚Äôt own that apartment, he didn‚Äôt pay off that debt from his company (he initially told me his parents helped pay it off and then like 3 mins later ‚Äúcame clean‚Äù and said that his business partner paid it off so I have literally no idea what the truth is there) and if anything, in my eyes, his parents are the ones who are financially supporting him.

So now, I‚Äôm dating a 31 yr old man who doesn‚Äôt pay his own phone bill, was lying to me and/or completely fabricating aspects of his life for 3 years, and then when confronted about it, continued to make up lies and then came clean about them 5 mins later. I‚Äôm obviously concerned that he could lie for this long, about fundamentally important things like our values, and so on.

I sincerely thought I would marry this man, he seemed to understand me like no one else and to be a truly caring and genuine person. Now I‚Äôm having a hard time rationalizing actually planning a life around someone who would not only lie about their background and family etc. but also financial aspects. Aside from that, I now can‚Äôt tell what is the truth and what is a lie. I‚Äôve also noticed other things he has lied about, called him out on it and he has denied it outright to my face. I see this as a form of gaslighting as I KNOW I‚Äôm not wrong but he is trying to convince me otherwise.

Am I overreacting? Is this a white lie that went haywire? Or is this actually a series of complete and utter bullshit used to manipulate me? And also, is it insane for me to actually consider a life with this man? Any advice is appreciated.","This isn't a white lie, this is a huge web of lies on which he's built the foundations of your relationship. I would forever be wondering what else he's lied about. Get out.",3002,173,2020-08-06 07:29:04,i4nbdc
relationships,UPDATE My (26F) ex boyfriend (27M) and roommate (25F) are still hanging out and it's bothering me.,"Here is a [LINK TO ORIGINAL POST](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/epmnay/my_26f_ex_boyfriend_27m_and_roommate_25f_are/) In summary, my ex and my roommate decided that they will continue to hang out together. 

So, the past week has been really hard for me. I am thankful that my boss is giving me 2 days off to recover and get back on my feet. Forty-eight hours after the breakup, I talked to my roommate and she said that while she understands how I feel, she will continue hanging out with him. I also talked to my ex and told him how uncomfortable I feel about the whole thing. He also said he understands, but thinks it's controlling of me to ask them not to hang out. Last week, they hung out for 5 days, for hours on end. They did respect my requests not to come inside the house when together, which I appreciate. 

Many posters suggested that they were having an affair. My ex claims that he did not break up with me to get with her. I did believe him at first, and maybe it was somewhat true, but I now think that something is going on and was going on. I found out that my roommate had a crush on my ex, while were were dating, yet still continued to hang out with him alone (while we were dating). I asked my ex while we were still dating if we could hang out just the two of us a little bit more, and I was accused then of being jealous and controlling. Turns out I was onto something. I suspect they are now trying to hide their relationship from me, though I cannot be sure.

Two days ago, I told my roommate that I no longer think it is healthy for me to live with her. She was fine with this and is asking around for places to stay. I will also consider leaving if she cannot leave. The most crushing thing about all this is that the two of them were people I considered best friends. This is also happening LESS THAN 2 weeks after the break up. It feels weird and rude to me. Of course they are within their rights to do whatever, but I feel like I was betrayed, even before the relationship ended. Maybe in time I'll be happy for them. 

TLDR; Ex and roommate hanging out still, I suspect something is going on and now they're hiding it from me.


Edit: you all are so kind! Thanks for the words of encouragement, tough love, and shared experiences. I am staying with a friend tonight and am hoping that the move-out situation goes smoothly. Living apart from my current roommate is the only viable option for me, moving forward. I will also be cutting contact from both of them as soon as the living situation is settled. 

I am going to therapy tomorrow, and went last week, so I‚Äôm hoping that helps. I am so thankful I have off from work. It‚Äôs been nice to just be able to rest.

Edit 2: roommate confirmed in a convo today that they are ‚Äúmore than friends.‚Äù","Damn, that's pretty fucked. Can pretty much guarantee one of them will fuck-up again once the honeymoon phase ends and they meet someone mildly interesting.",2995,124,2020-01-27 18:43:58,eus9hn
relationships,I [26F] accidentally told my dad [60sM] a family secret that wasn't mine to tell.,"I had a very awkward moment on the phone with my parents yesterday. I really like family history (not 24&me but like tracing the family tree), so I‚Äôve been doing some research. My dad asked about it and when he mentioned some previous research his first cousin ""Karen"" had done.

&#x200B;

>Me: ‚Äúwell yeah but that might not be our side of the family, right? She‚Äôs technically only your half your cousin right?""  
>  
>My Dad: ""What do you mean, no she's not, Karen is my Aunt Betsy's daughter so she's my cousin.‚Äù  
>  
>Me: ""Well Grandma and Aunt Betsy are half sisters, right? So you‚Äôre only like 25% related.‚Äù

To back up for a second, my grandma is in her 80s and does‚Äôt have dementia or anything.  She definitely didn‚Äôt just ""get confused"" and say something inaccurate, but it‚Äôs very possible she forgot that she hadn‚Äôt told her own son and therefore should tell him before she told his daughter.

When my grandma told me, it was in a casual context with my parents present (but evidently not listening to our conversation). She said she‚Äôd known/suspected since she was young that her younger sister Betsy was a product of an affair. She didn't really frame it as a huge secret, more just a family tidbit that she and Betsy had long since set aside.

&#x200B;

>My Dad: Wait, what do you mean 25%?  
>  
>Me:  ‚ÄúWell, Grandma and Betsy don‚Äôt have the same father so technically-""  
>  
>My mom: ‚ÄúWHAT? Great-Grandma Name had an affair?!?!?‚Äù

I stumblingly apologized and my dad sort of acted like this was something he knew about his mom/grandma, but I could tell from his recovery that he did not know, and was a little rattled by both the revelation and the fact that it had come from his daughter of all people.

It doesn‚Äôt immediately affect his personal self-image - his parents/grandparents are still the same people, we don‚Äôt really see that cousin and her family anymore, and obviously all of the adults involved are long dead, but still.

**TL;DR: I told my dad that his own grandmother had an affair and his cousin was his half-cousin. Should I do something? Should I say something to someone? Warn my grandma? Apologize to someone? Or just keep my mouth shut?**","You've done nothing wrong. Your grandmother told you within earshot of your parents and never said it was a secret. However, you might want to check in with your dad. Something like, ""When we talked about Aunt Betsy, I had no idea you didn't know. I'm sorry if it came as a surprise. Grandma mentioned it to me when we visited, so she could probably tell you all about it. I love you and I hope you're ok.""

Not acknowledging what happened may be more uncomfortable for you and your dad, and also gives far too much importance to this decades-old secret.",2946,50,2020-01-29 18:54:50,evr8cj
relationships,"UPDATE: My (20F) GF (22F) expects me to play videogames with the person she cheated on me with, like nothing happened.","This post is an update to this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/fkv4g1/my\_20f\_gf\_22f\_expects\_me\_to\_play\_videogames\_with/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/fkv4g1/my_20f_gf_22f_expects_me_to_play_videogames_with/)

Hey everyone. Thanks for all the comments.  


After the post, I talked to her. Telling her that something felt shady about the whole cheating accident, I asked her for details, that I needed her to be honest.  


Just a reminder, before this, she told me it was not a big deal, just some sexual texts. Turns out, it was that, plus nudes, plus bonding, plus other sexual stuff. It was at the point she thought about leaving me for him.  


I was dumbfounded. She admited that despite telling me she stopped talking to him, she didn't. That, in her point of view, he saved her life, as he was the only person in the world she felt comfortable enough talking in details about her suicidal thoughts, and that ""sex was just to thank him, he deserved it"".   


She refused to stop talking to him. I told her that, in this case, we'd break up. She told me to grow up, we broke up. She went CRAZY and sent me images of her hurting herself, saying she's kill herself and asking her friends to tell me she'll kill herself.  


After some time, she calmed down and apologized. I told her that at first I wanted to break up to heal, trust her again and maybe build a new romantic relationship, but that it was impossible after the crap she did.   


I'll focus on myself rn, but I'm still feeling dependant, and I still... love her. We agreed on a friends with benefits kinda relationship if everything was cool between us at the end of the quarantine (which could end at the end of the month, or in a month, depending on the situation.)  


I know you told me it was a bad idea, but heh, I need time to change everything. I'll handle it. My therapist also told me not to make rash decisions like cutting her off completly, but to focus on myself. I'll do that.  


Thanks again!

Edit.: So guys. You realise I said that we would consider a FwB relationship if everything seemed fine after the quarantine. That nothing is set in stone. I... Thank you for your support. I'm thinking a lot rn. Also, my therapist didn't tell me ""don't cut her off"", she told me ""don't make rash decisions, as you have the tendency to live through other people. Make your own choices"", because I've told her about asking for advice on reddit. Thanks again for all the comments. I'm reading them all! OH and PLEASE remember, we're two women.

relationships,I (30F) caught my husband (31M) in an affair and I don‚Äôt know how to move on.,"I‚Äôve suspected things had been going on for a while, but kept brushing it off‚ÄîI thought he would never do that to me. Since around April, he‚Äôs been refusing my attempts to have sex most of the time, sitting differently on the couch to where he‚Äôs facing away from me... little things. 

It‚Äôs with one of our good friends. She came to my house a few weeks ago. She‚Äôs texted me. She‚Äôs pretended to be there for me. 

I found out because I rolled over and they were having a Snapchat conversation. She said she wished she could be there to hold him and he summarized that I tried to seduce him last night and mocked it. I confronted him and he admitted it. He said that it was because quarantine was stressful. He does not want to work things out. He thinks of me ‚Äúonly as a friend in his heart.‚Äù

When I told her husband, he confronted her and apparently they actually kissed back in February. I think at that moment, I was never going to be enough for him. 

We used to be so so so happy. The week before they kissed, we celebrated Valentine‚Äôs Day together. He bought us a nice bottle of wine for our anniversary. We had fun, we were perfect. 

I don‚Äôt know where to go from here. We‚Äôve been married only about a year. I feel like he took so much from me and doesn‚Äôt even want to go to therapy or work this out. I don‚Äôt want to leave my house but everywhere in it I see him. He chose her. I‚Äôve been cheated in every relationship I‚Äôve ever been in. He was supposed to be my forever. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôve made therapy appointments but I was also laid off last month, so I have too much free time to analyze every single moment where he might have been lying to me or where I made myself pathetic trying to cling to him. 

How do I start to get through this?

TLDR; My husband had an affair and does not want to try to work out our marriage. I feel like I‚Äôm drowning and don‚Äôt know how to start moving on.","Lawyer first. Get the divorce filed, and get their advice on if it's ok for you to leave the house while things are processing.

As for the other, you need to fill your time. Devote yourself to hobbies, including picking up new ones. Rely on friends - long video calls, watching movies together, etc. Fill as much of your time as you can until things start to process.

I'm so sorry he gave up on you without even trying, hon. You deserve far better than that. It's a shame some people are so good at hiding how little respect they have for other folk, but please hold onto the fact that *none of this was your fault*. There is absolutely zero reason for a partner to cheat, ever, and there is absolutely no justification that can put even a shred of the blame on you.",2935,82,2020-08-11 17:58:49,i7wkqu

Hey all! Reddit emailed me about verifying this account, which I completely forgot even existed, so I checked it out and went back and read my post from 5 years ago. I read through the comments again, and I figured maybe it'd be worth posting an update since honestly, I have no idea how I was defending this person at the time...

Pretty much, I made that post about my boyfriend thinking it was ""very weird"" that I lived with my brother at a point where my boyfriend and I had been dating for a few months shy of a year. One month after I made that post, my brother ended up moving out anyway, and my boyfriend and I moved to another apartment (all planned, and just a matter of the lease ending), so the situation had mostly resolved itself.

However, LET ME TELL YOU, holy shit, I wish I would have taken the advice given to me in the post, and I cringed reading through this 5-year-old post because a lot of the comments were so true, and I should have just left. I put up with his shit for a total of 4 years before he broke up with me (""for good"" - we actually broke up probably 10-12 different times that lasted anywhere from a few hours to a couple of weeks). 

The entire time, he was definitely jealous of my brother. Pretty much, he ended up admitting that my brother was a guy who commanded a room, people always looking to him (like, he's sort of a ""leader"" in his friend group), and making people laugh. That was the type of person my (now ex-) boyfriend wanted to be, so he hated that my brother was that. In fits of rage, even in a *completely* unrelated argument, he would randomly be like ""I bet you've fucked your brother!"" So much shit coming from him, but I think that the combination of he and I in a relationship together was just incredibly toxic and made it so hard for me to be able to think about things rationally. 

There was a comment in my original post about someone wishing I could see the situation from the outside, and looking back at that post, I feel like I finally am, and it's just cringeworthy. Someone had PM'd me a list of signs of an abusive relationship, and looking back, he definitely checks off most of those. I had said that he rarely lies to me, but in retrospect, our relationship was FULL of lies - some major ones that I recall from before I made that post, so I'm not sure if I was lying to myself then or what.

I'm in a much better place now, and have had a new boyfriend for about 2 years. I think the takeaway here, and why I wanted to post an update is for people perhaps in a similar situation (regardless of what it might be about) to consider. If your SO is absolutely ridiculous when it comes to something, don't expect it to be okay just because you can maybe avoid that topic in the future. It's possible that it will still come up, and it's very likely that this isn't a red flag to ignore just because it's easy to ignore. It's still a raging red flag, and has a lot of implications for your relationship in the future.

**tl;dr**: Stayed with boyfriend of < 1 year at the time for about 4 years. He was super jealous of my brother and thought living with him was very weird. Post-breakup, I finally have clarity and he was ridiculous.","Thanks for posting this.  Although I was not around here back then, it was cool of you to update and recognize those who were trying to help.  I'm glad to hear things have gotten better for you with that creep out of your life..",2902,37,2020-07-31 18:13:52,i1chj5
relationships,[Update] my (21f) boyfriend (24m) doesn‚Äôt want me posting pictures of me in shorts,"I just wanted to make and update to this post that I made from about a month ago for anybody interested :) [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ft1whw/my\_21f\_boyfriend\_24m\_doesnt\_want\_me\_posting/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ft1whw/my_21f_boyfriend_24m_doesnt_want_me_posting/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) 

I took in everybody's comments and my own feelings into consideration and sat my partner down for a serious talk after our fight. (im sorry i didn't practice proper social distancing. i drove to his apartment to have this talk because i felt that it would be better to have this discussion face to face rather than thru text or call as our fight was thru that medium) I also reiterated why this was important to me and brought up all the points you guys made and really made him listen and consider. 

And surprisingly, he took it really well! There were some tears here and there but in the end he understood my point and he apologized for not being completely considerate of me and my choices. He said he wanted our relationship to work and he was sorry for hurting me through his actions and he'll try to be better in the long run. He also said he didn't want to be that person that takes away my freedom and my choices just because we're in a relationship. (I sobbed really hard at this one lol)

So overall that turned out pretty nice and since then we've been smooth sailing. We also decided to quarantine together as time apart raised some tension between us and neither of us wanted to catch anything or infect anyone and not adhere to proper social distancing by still travelling back and forth to each other's places. 

Just wanna say thanks you guys <3

tldr; boyfriend understood my pov and the points that you guys brought up, apologized and promised to be better! now we're both stuck at home and happy :)","I feel like these types of behaviors and actions are things that everybody goes through between 17-25. Most people don‚Äôt figure out why that type of controlling aggressive nature is wrong until they‚Äôre in their late 20s or early 30s. Normal, people typically don‚Äôt put those kind of expectations on their significant others because it‚Äôs controlling and cruel , but people with cultural or social expectations don‚Äôt understand why they feel the way they do and don‚Äôt understand how irrational their actions and behaviors truly are. I‚Äôm so happy he is willing to learn from this , this will make him a better person going forward.

So many people I know have had to deal with this type of stuff, with varying degrees of understanding . It makes me sad knowing some people can‚Äôt understand the damage they do with this behavior long after the relationship is over, if you could tell your boyfriend this is one of those situations where you‚Äôre going to have to learn to understand your actions, and you‚Äôre going to have to keep working on a rational perspective. He‚Äôs far ahead of most guys and girls his age if he‚Äôs able to fix this . Good job!",2838,58,2020-04-27 12:21:33,g8zo4o
relationships,My (31f) husband (34m) and I got into a terrible verbal fight and I don't know if we can come back from it.,"We have often argued during our marriage (of 7 years), but resentment has been building this year, along with many stressors. My father passed away at the beginning of 2019. Husband was laid off in April and had a very hard time finding another job. At his new job, I felt he was becoming far too cozy with a secretary and it led to a lot of arguments.

&#x200B;

Yesterday we got into what should have been a minor disagreement. Instead, it's like the floodgates of resentment on both our sides opened and we both just escalated the fight.

&#x200B;

We ended up saying things I don't think can be ever taken back. I know I was saying things that I felt were true but had never really said. I assume he was doing the same. Some of the things that were said:

&#x200B;

\- he told me I was fat and always miserable and he was far happier at work than at home around me.

\- I told him other men hit on me and obviously don't feel I'm too fat, and I told him he wasn't nearly hot enough to call me fat.

\- he told me that I was lazy and boring and that anyone hitting on me was probably just looking for a hook-up and would quickly become turned off by my personality.

\- I told him that at least I didn't act inappropriately with other men because, unlike him, I am respectful of our marriage and quickly shut stuff down rather than flirting with the office slut.

\- He said at least she was fun and kind and had a beautiful body, so when he had to come home to me every night of course he flirted with her at work because she was a nicer person than me and hotter than me.

\- I told him she could have him because he was a boring, lazy lover anyway and I'm sure after she sampled his ""technique"" she would quickly lose interest.

\- he then told me he was boring and lazy with me in bed because he found me gross and he's never been attracted to my body and he only has sex with me when he really wants to cum, but he just wants to get it over with quickly.

&#x200B;

I'm ashamed of how we acted. But the nasty soul-crushing things we said to each other -- I'm guessing we can't come back from that, right? I can't imagine having sex with him again now. Is this something that we could work through in counselling? Or should we call it a day and move forward to separate?

&#x200B;

**tldr: after months of stress and resentment, a mundane argument exploded into vicious verbal insults between my husband and I where we attacked each other's insecurities....need to know if it's fixable.**","Two relevant questions: do you WANT to fix it?  Does he?  If either of you answer ""no"", then no amount of counseling will help.",2827,237,2020-01-04 20:00:37,ek1kth
relationships,[UPDATE] My [22F] boyfriend [32M] has trouble controlling his anger and has untreated mental health issues,"Hi all! I wanted to thank you for all of your responses on my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ep3scw/my_22f_boyfriend_32m_has_trouble_controlling_his/). I got so much support and I feel that it's appropriate to do an update.

Posting anonymously on this subreddit was a huge step for me. So many people were blunt and honest about the reality of the situation based on what I posted. I have felt hurt for so long, and it felt great to get some feedback and support.

After I posted here, I soon told my therapist and even read most of your responses out loud to her. It was eye opening to me, and she agreed that I'm in an abusive situation and it's not my job to wait around for this person to change. She also recognized the gaslighting and manipulation that was involved which was hard for me to accept at first. When I talked to my boyfriend about my concerns things got pretty ugly. He didn't respond to it well, and we talked back and forth for about a week over text and phone. At times he was apologetic, at other times he minimized my feelings even more and tried to justify his behavior. (At one point he said it was ""ignorant and selfish"" of me to criticize his ""mental health issues""...okay?) Guilting, manipulation, even gaslighting. I couldn't take it anymore. Oh yeah, and when I stood my ground and repeated the statement ""I felt intimidated and afraid when you blared on the horn, threw the change, and yelled at me,"" he had the nerve to say (this is all over text mind you, and my friends/therapist agreed I was communicating very reasonably) ""I feel scared and intimidated by you right now, this whole convo is triggering"" lmfao??? Are you for real?

Throughout all of the back and forth since the initial incident happened (the rage fit) I finally opened up to my close friends and all of them were hugely supportive of me and attentive to listen. They didn't know the extent of his rage and agreed that this was unhealthy. It felt really good to open up to them, for so long I wanted to defend this person's behavior.

I broke up with him last night. My friends and even my dad agreed that I don't owe it to this person to break up in person, so I did it through text, exchanged goodbyes, and blocked him on every platform. I'm excited to move on in my life and focus on my schooling, friends, and just myself in general.

Thank you all again for the support and feedback, I needed it. I feel like my life has been changed for the better and the responses I got were huge for me to take that step. 

\*\*TL;DR;\*\* Listened to y'alls advice, dumped his ass, and I'm moving on. Thank you again!! <3","Good for you OP, there's a line between supporting and understanding someone's mental health issues and letting them use those issues to excuse their abusive behaviors. And he was definitely doing that. 

People need support to change but without the will and work by that person, no amount of outside support will help that person improve. You did the right thing by demanding more",2799,53,2020-01-22 21:47:33,esit2d
relationships,My (28M) bf just drunk called me to tell me (25f) his ex moved on too quick.,"I've been dating my current bf for a year now. We have been long distance since the start of 2018. He recently went back to his home country and on the second day of his trip, went out for drinks with his friends. His ex showed up at the club with her current  bf and since they haven't seen each other for more than a year, it made sense for the two of them to say hi to each other. One thing led to another and an argument started. My BF left the club feeling disappointed and too drunk of course. He gets to the house and calls me telling me how heart broken he is. As a good gf of course I ask what the issue is. Only to find out that his ex moved on too quick and her presence still hurts him. One year has gone to waste. Feeling really hurt. At this point I feel like breaking up with him is the only solution. You really can't be with someone who hasn't moved on. I really do love him very much but it's really hurts knowing that he still loves his ex. What do I do?

Tldr; My bf just called me to tell me his ex gf moved on too fast. Should I break up with him?",I can understand having a sad drunk moment when you see your ex for the first time after a break up. It does seem like a lot though - you guys have been together for a year and he‚Äôs concerned his ex moved on too quickly?? Idk have a sober chat but be suspicious,2746,183,2020-01-25 03:04:28,etl7ge
relationships,Update: My stepdad(M40) and I(F20) play video games together and my mom(F46) is feeling left out.,"Update to this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/enqf1y/my_stepdadm40_and_if20_play_video_games_together/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

Edited for better clarity. 

Update: Things have been really good since I made my last post!! My mom and I sat down and made plans to get some board games, that are 2 player+, so we can all play together, even if someone is out of the house. She is also considering picking out some video games that interest her so she can learn the system, and is open to trying my games out as well. My stepdad and I have been individually hanging out with her on her time off. 

I wanted to also follow up on a question I received on my previous post about if she was truly feeling left out: I could tell just by her demeanor that she was a bit distant during the time that my stepdad and I played games together. But also, I think I may have been projecting my own feelings and maybe making the situation worse than it was, since I will never know how she truly felt. This question really made me think about the deeper aspect to the situation, and as I said before, my mom is my best friend. I came to realize that I was also feeling a bit disconnected from her and missing her presence. It‚Äôs perfectly fine to have our own hobbies individually but in this case I think there was just prolonged isolation that led to insecurity, from my own side at least.

I can‚Äôt say that the situation is perfect and resolved yet but there is definitely progress being made! And that is relieving. I‚Äôm excited to have these future bonding times as a whole. 
Thank you to everyone who weighed in and took time out of their day to help me out. It truly means a lot. 

TLDR; We made plans to hang out together more. Thank you.",This is incredibly sweet and I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs working out,2736,53,2020-01-17 00:40:44,epslgg
relationships,"I've [f/29] started dating someone far more attractive [m/31], help?","We've been dating for 3 weeks. Too early to know exactly where it's going, but so far he's been openly enthusiastic. I haven't felt this nervous in years! Obviously I know he's not perfect and I'm keeping an eye on that side of things too, as it's easy to get swept away.

He's very attractive, well spoken, well-read, open about his interest but not over doing it. Fantastic kisser. We're in the same industry and have similar life plans. Lots in common as far as interests. Hell, even similar ugly-duckling stories. He's been super respectful anytime I mention a boundary of sorts. I have a few as my last long-term relationship was quite abusive. Luckily my ex has been out of my life for 2 years. FWIW - I haven't mentioned my ex yet, just vague things like ""oh do you mind not surprising me from behind? I'm a bit jumpy."" This isn't my first time dating since my ex and I have plenty of  (positive!) dating experiences from before him too. I really shouldn't feel so... Almost starstruck.

**I just feel like a teenager again. Half the time I don't know what to say I'm so flustered. How do I get my nervousness under control and just enjoy the moment?** If this doesn't work out I'll be fine - I'm not so worried about my heart so much as trying to act like myself and less struck on dates! 

TL;DR: Met an awesome guy. Obviously trying to keep my head, but how to I stop losing my thoughts and wit while we're talking?

Edit: Wow I was not expecting so many responses! Thanks all - it's great hearing stories of folks in similar situations, as well as some tips and tricks I can use to stay appropriately excited. Really appreciate the kindness shown!

Edit 2: I should have phrased it like I'm not used to being so attracted to someone. I'm quite confident in myself and his interest! But that doesn't help me when he does something very goofy and charming and I'm a bit lost in how attractive he is. The limerence is strong haha. All the same the answers have been super lovely and encouraging!",Remember how great you thought your ex was in the beginning? Allow that hindsight to dial your feelings and expectations back to something more reasonable.,2719,99,2020-12-24 20:24:36,kjm5pf
relationships,Update: Midlife Crisis or the end of the Honeymoon Period?,"Well, I thought I would update everyone.

&#x200B;

I (34F) had a nice short talk with my BF (46M) tonight.  

&#x200B;

We started talking and at one point he told me ""I don't want to live together"" and I said, ""Then I think we should see other people.""

&#x200B;

It was odd because he seemed relieved.  I'm hurt but hey, I guess that's what needed to be done.  We are still friends, we have always been since we met.  We do a lot of work together so I know it will be weird but I actually don't think it will be that different.  

&#x200B;

Thank you, everyone, for your suggestions and support.

TL:DR: 8 years not wasted only lessons learned.  On to the next step of my life.","This is sad but ultimately good. It seems like he never really wanted the relationship to continue or develop but lacked the courage and courtesy to tell you that straight so he just half assed it until you left. You, being seemingly a nice and supportive person, then suffered through that for years.

Time to move on. For a while I suggest you avoid him to the extent you can. I realise you will cross paths but given he is, well, fucking lame, he may decide he made the wrong choice. You shouldn't let that happen.

Time to go date. You need a change of scene. Use those weekends you got back to expand your social options. Join a dating site. Try a new activity. Your now-ex was not abusive perhaps but was stifling you. The right person will want to set you free then fly off alongside you.",2604,29,2020-02-07 01:47:40,f036gj
relationships,My dad (71m) died yesterday and I'm (27m) scared of the future,"
TL;DR my dad died and I'm scared my family won't get along 


I'm sorry if I begin ramble typing this is like one of my first posts on any sub reddit and I am just overwhelmed. So yesterday after my dad comes home he eats what my mom made for him. Eggs and spam. 

To be clear, he has a pre existing medical history of high blood pressure and gout. First found out when he was admitted to the hospital in 2015 when he fell ill and we basically had to force him to go to the hospital bc he didn't wanna go. He was put on medication since, with changes to them maybe a year or so ago.

So back to when after he ate. My half sister heard a thud around 740 ish and told me to check bc she thought maybe my parents are arguing. I go down and see my dad on the kitchen floor w my mom behind him a few feet away and I hear him snoring. I ask my mom a question get worried run back upstairs and knock on my sisters door. She calls my other sister and also tells me to stop wasting time call 911. I was scared and frantic I wish I called 911 or saw him when he came in so I could maybe have called sooner...

They get frantic too and we all start yelling at each other and I try to maintain order also as I'm talking to 911 person. At some point in all of this my brother in law yells for help and I help him turn my dad onto his side bc he said he could choke on his saliva. My dad stops snoring and we start panicking. The ems tells us how to perform cpr but my sisters keep yelling and so I try to get them working together. They finally start working on it one is doing compression and the other giving him air and sometimes rotating. Fire dept and ambulance gets here and they start doing the same thing but also have defibrillators and honestly I'm just in shock still. It was maybe 8:03pm when they came or so i dont remember it's all a blur I checked my phone for time stamp but I called twice so I forgot when original call was placed. 

They called it at 8:50pm and I just begin to lose it. My aunt comes and my sister is trying to call my dads work to let his bosses know...

We talk about how we want my dads arrangements and agree on cremation bc we dont have the money for anything else but also my sister wants the remains. 

Honestly. I wrote this post bc I'm scared for the future. My mom is bipolar schizophrenic and my sisters and bro in law dont get along w her because of a whole history that would keep you here forever if I tried to type it. My dad was a big shit talker but he still chose us and tried his best to provide regardless of his fallacies. He had my mom's back too saying he wouldn't kick her out or place her in a mental home.

My sisters kinda want that (I think) but I'm scared to talk about it. My mom is ok sometimes but also acts up bc of her mental illness sometimes and my dad and I were her constants regardless of what happened. My mom is old and still wants to benefit from some social security services that my dad had but my sisters (and i) think we should get a majority control of his account bc theres a lot of renovations to be done bc he ignored upkeep of the house for a number of years (example, the roof) my mom is not very sad about the ordeal bc she had a long history of mental abuse from my dad and I understand but we for some reason stayed together. Idk how to move forward except for one moment at a time and I'm still waiting for funeral home to come pick up his body (its 8:13 am now, been waiting since night before) and I have been crying but also I can't sleep and I'm sorry if this doesn't meet guidelines I just need to vent even tho I told a few friends I'm still in disbelief. I'm sorry to write so much I just can't help it. Idk how this will work moving forward. I believe it can though. But it's hard to stay positive","People react to grief and loss very differently. You are going to see a lot of emotions being worked through and buried problems being brought up, and you will absolutely see a lot of anger. 

The ‚Äòsnoring‚Äô was agonal breathing, it often happens after heart failure. **He was not taking a breath**, his lungs were only reacting to his brain firing all shots before giving up. He was likely dead before he was moved to his side, long before the CPR. 

Do not blame yourself. You couldn‚Äôt have called 911 before it happened, and that would have been the only way to save him from cardiac arrest. You did not waste time. You did not cause it to happen. You reacted, and you gave good directions on CPR to your siblings. You did everything right. 

Your family will either splinter apart, or come together. Some members might use his death as a way to cut the final tie to your mother. You can still have a relationship with all of these people separately, you do not have to choose sides. Do not take on the responsibility of keeping everyone together. Take on the responsibility of healing yourself. You need to look into therapy because you were there when it happened and trust me, it effects you. Even if you feel numb now, you will need to talk this out. You cannot control how others react, you can‚Äôt control who supports who, you need to make sure you are okay before you try to help anyone else.",2492,53,2020-04-05 12:22:47,fvczfk

Almost every reply was saying that I should leave him and the relationship was no good. So on Christmas eve I packed a bag and I left.

relationships,"My (F31) brother (M36) is ruining our parents (M,F60s) lives!","This is going to be quite the wall of text, so feel free to jump down to the tl;dr.

So in the past month my older brother's fiancee left him. This meant he lost his house because the home they lived in was in her name. He lost his vehicle because what he was driving was her old car. He also lost his job because he was so focused on his breakup that he was constantly making mistakes. He moved in with our parents who live about 5 minutes away from my husband and I.

I DO have a lot of sympathy for him. He literally has nothing, no home, no car, no job, no relationship. The problem is, this is third time this has happened to him. That's right, he has had 3 fiancees leave him now and every time he winds up losing everything. He has had two cars impounded because he gets so upset over his breakups he loses his job and can't make payments on his vehicles. My parents and I have bailed him out of these situations every time. I even paid off his back payments on his car, paid for his dog's vet bills, AND paid some of his rent before. My parents and I have literally spent thousands of dollars trying to 'help' him. Each of the past two times he winds up moving back in with my parents who are in their late 60s.

While we pay for everything for him whenever he goes through a breakup he becomes a total jerk. He spends every weekend with his friends out camping or vacationing (how he pays for it I have no idea, after the second fiancee he took a trip to Fiji with his friends but couldn't afford to pay his rent). He mostly ignores me unless he needs money, which, during this breakup I am refusing to help him out at all. The worst part is he treats my parents like garbage. If they ask him questions like, ""have you been looking for a job?"" he will yell at them. He has no problem eating the food they provide for him and living in their house rent and utility free, and driving my mom's brand new car (which she got because he totaled her last car) but makes them absolutely miserable. My mom told me he will yell at them, call her stupid, trashes their house, sleeps all day, and leaves the care of his dog up to them. Every time I see my mom lately it's obvious that she's been crying.

The most recent event took place on Sunday. In an attempt to get him out of the house for a while I offered to take him out in our boat. He seemed super excited about it and when he's excited he can actually be a lot of fun to be around. He tells me he's hanging out with friends but will be back in town Sunday afternoon. Sunday afternoon rolls around and he's nowhere to be seen. I get a text around 6pm that he's decided to go to a local tourist destination with all his friends, they are going to tube down a river. I'm bummed because I was honestly looking forward to it and because my brother has once again chosen his friends over his family. But it's whatever, I honestly don't rely on him for anything so it's not that big of deal. But then I find out he's driving my mom's car and she has to be in her office early Monday morning. Then the peaceful protests in our town turn into full on riots and my brother is still not home. At this point he can't get home because they've blocked off access to our town so he just stays with his friends and I wind up taking my mom to work. My Dad tries to talk to my brother on Monday about how irresponsible he was and my brother just yells at him and then locks himself in my parents basement for the rest of the day.

My parents are miserable. They want to help and have always said they will do anything for us kids, but they are just enabling my brother every time they bail him out. My Dad has major health problems that are being exacerbated by the stress my brother is causing. My mom has a history of severe depression that I see her slipping back into the longer my brother is with them. I'm really close to my parents and they are usually very fun people. The longer my brother stays with them I am seeing them become depressed, short-tempered, and miserable. I tried telling them to kick him out, one of his friends would surely take him in, but they insist that they don't want to leave him homeless. I can't convince them to kick them out but is there anything else I can say or do that might get my brother to get his head out his ass and get a job? How can I get my brother to see his behavior towards my parents is unacceptable?

It just sucks, I used to really look up to my older brother because he is outgoing and funny and the sort of person everyone just gravitates towards. Now I'm just pissed at him for how he treats my parents and simultaneously scared for his mental health because he clearly has a lot of problems.

&#x200B;

tl;dr Older brother lost his fiancee, house, car, and job. My parents took him in and he is now treating them like garbage.

&#x200B;

\*\*UPDATE\*\* Thank you for the responses. A couple of things: I am in no position to psychoanalyze my brother or parents, but I do believe that mental health is a primary reason for how any human acts the way they do and clearly my brother's mental health is not good. I am encouraging my family to see therapists, but decided I will not be paying for my brother's because there is truly no telling if he would go or be willing to change. Also, my mom works for a not-for-profit for the elderly and specializes in elderly abuse cases. She told me that she knows what he is doing is 'technically' elder abuse, but she does not want to report it or want me to report it. If things get any worse though, I will go behind her back. 

I went to my parents house last night for an unrelated reason and had a brief talk with my brother that devolved into a shouting match. I started by showing him four different jobs I found online that he could apply for, but none of them were 'good enough' for him. He was 'insulted' that I thought he would work those jobs and that's when the shouting match started. I'm an educator, I KNOW I shouldn't have let myself get into a power struggle with him, but siblings just know how to push your buttons, you know?

ANYWAY, I was able to talk to my mom one on one and she is totally unwilling to do anything about him. She will not even give him a deadline of when he has to have a job, nor will she stop lending him her car. She also reiterated how miserable she is in her own home with him around, but insists she's feels so bad for him she doesn't want to force him to do anything. 

So I told her that I am done with him, and I will not be spending any time at their house as long as they continue to let him drain them of their health, finances, and mental well-being. I told her she and Dad are welcome at my house any time, but my brother is not. I have to tell you, I have never felt like a shittier person, it's not in my nature to just give up on people. ",It‚Äôs not a mistake that these women keep leaving him. I‚Äôm guessing mooches off them too until they break up. Your will not change until he faces consequences for his actions and you and your parents stop enabling him. He‚Äôs almost 40 and behaving like a teenager. That‚Äôs appalling but you can‚Äôt fix him.,2463,121,2020-06-03 14:35:10,gvv22q
relationships,Update: How do I (25F) go about cutting my mother (59F) off financially?,"I posted a while ago about my struggles with living with my parents and my plans to move out and how my mum made it clear that if I ever move out I have to still keep supporting her.

www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/edklq5/how_do_i_25f_go_about_cutting_my_mother_59f_off/

--------------------************--------
As of today, I have furnished my new place and today I told them that I plan to move out over the coming weeks and all hell broke loose. 

I'm in a very low place now but deep down I know im doing the right thing. 

I was given a lecture for over an hour, Among the things they said:

1. Moving out will destroy the family relationship.  
2. I am being selfish to think that I should be independent.  
3. Im trying to abandon my culture and he an American.  
4. Instead of paying money in rent I should be saving so we can all buy a house together. 
5. It is wrong for a girl to not stay with her family before marriage as it will damage my prospects. 
6. I should stay to fix the issues we have as a family. 
7. They need my financial support still. 
8. I will be leaving the spiritual covering of God from my parents and bad things will start happening to me. 
9. Other people will look down on me and the family. 
10. I am selfish. 

So they have decided that since I can't break the lease,  my Aunty will start staying there ( in the apartment I payed for and furnished with my money) instead for the lease period while I stay home. 

Honestly I can't explain how horrible I feel. I feel like a bad child, a selfish person but I'm still going to move. If they stop speaking to me so be it. I've offered to visit every weekend but they said no, I have to stay with them till I marry. 

I will still try to offer some financial support when I can because I can't bear for them to struggle financially, but right now I am officially a black sheep, selfish daughter and who is causing family trouble.  I can't take the mind games anymore. 


EDIT: Thanks everyone for the support and advice given. I can see now that I made a mistake telling then before actually leaving but it was helpful to have that conversation with them, it has shown me that my independence and happiness is not as important to them as it is to me. Hopefully they will come around but for now I'm keeping my boundaries up. 

I have taken my documents and stuff from the house and completely moved to my apartment. 


TL:DR: I've told my parents I'm moving and they don't want me to leave so that I can keep living under their control and supporting them financially.","Do not let your aunty stay there! Your name is on the lease. Don‚Äôt give them a key, cut them off if you have too. You deserve your own happiness.",2464,237,2020-01-13 05:08:50,enzl7o
relationships,"UPDATE: I (22M) have always bottled up my feelings, but my GF (23F) wants me to open up more to her.","Original:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/iils7b/i\_22m\_have\_always\_bottled\_up\_my\_feelings\_but\_my/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/iils7b/i_22m_have_always_bottled_up_my_feelings_but_my/)

Hi! So, I know it hasn't been long since I posted on here, but a LOT has changed in a such a short amount of time, and I believe this post warrants its own update. Thank you to everyone on this and multiple other subreddits for their kindness and good advice. You helped me realize what I needed to do to get all these years of emotional turmoil out of my system while still maintaining my relationship with my GF.

(TL;DR at the bottom)

My original plan with Katie was to go on a break (but not break up) while she went out of town with her family for a week. She'd be healing from the loss of her mother, and I'd be looking into better means of handling my emotions than just bottling them up.

Well, I couldn't wait a week to resolve this. Since that night, this whole ordeal had been consuming my every thought, to the point where I thought I was gonna puke from the tension. I was afraid of both losing Katie, and of facing my feelings. I've had these mental barriers up for so long that the idea of them coming down scared me. My mind kept switching between being stoic, and being ready to burst in anger or sadness. I knew I had to let myself feel, but I didn't want to because of how much it hurt, but I couldn't just shake it off like I'd always done. I was scared, alone, and ready to burst.

Later that day, I got a text from Katie asking if I could come over. She wanted to give me something before she left on her trip tomorrow. I headed for my car without a second thought. I decided that if I couldn't handle my emotions by myself, I'd do it with the one person I felt comfortable showing them with.

Once at her apartment, I did my best to stay calm in front of Katie, but I was already a mess. I was stammering every other sentence, dropping things, my voice and body trembling. It was obvious I was about to explode. Then, Katie showed me her phone. She said her dad had video recorded her mom's funeral, and asked if I'd like a copy to keep. I said yes, and Katie sent me a link to it on her DropBox, and I started watching it with her.

Now, I was there at the actual funeral. The part that made me so close to crying before was when the preacher and family eulogies described Katie's mom: a nurturing, loving figure you could always turn to when you needed it. Someone ready with warm hugs, a shoulder to cry on, a sense of security knowing you were taken care of. Basically, everything I DIDN'T have from my single father. Every other time I've felt the tears coming on, I'd hold them back like a reflex. This time, though, instead of fighting my emotions, I fought the reflex. I let the tears pool in my eyes, and fought hard to keep my hands away from my face. I could really feel it now; all the years of anger, sadness, pain, and other negativity I'd kept bottled up inside were reaching the surface.

That did it. After all these years of being so afraid to, I started crying. It wasn't straight-up bawling; it was actually a bit forced at first. I wanted the tears to flow, but some part of me was screaming, ""No, stop it! Shame on you! This isn't appropriate for a man!""

Then, Katie gave me a hug, gently rubbing my back, saying things like ""It's ok,"" or ""Just let it all out,"" or ""you don't have to keep being strong for me."" At one point, she said, ""My mom always made me feel safe whenever I was sad. Now I wanna do the same for you."" That REALLY did it for me. I bawled my eyes out like someone just put all of Niagara Falls into my tear ducts. Katie just kept hugging me, and even kissed my head at one point. At first, I HATED how I was feeling; reliving all the fear, sadness, and hatred for everything my father put me through. This was more painful than any physical injury I'd ever sustained in my life. After a while, though, I realized I was finally getting the kind of love and support I wanted so badly as a kid. I didn't know Katie's mom very well, and my own mom even less, but based on how everyone described her, Katie was doing an AMAZING job of living through her mom's legacy of love and kindness. For the first time in ages, I felt like my feelings mattered.

For the next 3 or so hours, I just kept crying and crying. Of course, Katie couldn't sit there hugging me the whole time, but she did her best to keep me comfortable as I cried out 7 years worth of tears. She brought me tissues, water, gentle back rubs, and more hugs when she could, letting me know I could ""take all the time you needed."" She's such a trooper. Not even my own father had this kind of patience for me.

When I was finally done, Katie offered to have me spent the night with her. I was too tired, puffy-eyed, and had too bad a headache to drive safely home, so I graciously accepted. She later ordered my favorite takeout for dinner, and we finished the night with Stranger Things, and a make-out session. Katie's definitely a keeper.

Katie's out of town now, but I'm still looking into effective techniques and methods for letting myself feel and cry again (if I have to.) I know all my problems didn't just disappear in one night, so I'll be seeing counseling regularly once my community college reopens in a few weeks. Hopefully, Katie will be feeling well enough from her loss to come back to class with me, too.

TY for listening. :)

TL;DR: After years of bottling up my feelings, I finally let myself cry (with my GF's help,) and I feel MUCH better about it.

Edit: For those of you concerned that I'll start treating Katie like my mother or therapist, don't worry, I'm determined to prevent that from being the case. I can't afford therapy ATM, so I'll be seeing a counselor once my community college reopens later in September. I've also been looking into additional resources, like free online counseling.

Also, TYVM for all your kind words, advice, and awards! I didn't expect this post to blow up like this!","I can tell you from experience bottling up your feelings only ends in pain and hurt. At 22 your probably thinking  im fine but if you keep doing that for say another 20 years you will implode. 

Its not healthy and you should and need to find away to cope express and deal with those feelings. In a positive way.",2406,61,2020-08-31 08:10:42,iju35i
relationships,My (F 46) sons (21) girlfriend (20) got me something I know she can't afford and I worry about her,"My son and his girlfriend have been dating for over two years now. They go to the same college. She moved in with him in the midst of quarantine but eventually went home. Her parents are horrible and practically kicked her out in the middle of the night. My son had to pull some strings to even get her a flight.

For her birthday, I bought her a necklace. It was before quarantine so I bought it overseas. It made me think of her. I care for her and I wanted too. It was pricy but I can afford it. I remember her face when I gave it to her. She looked terrified like I pulled a gun on her. She kept looking at it then at me. She stuttered so much before thanking me. Throughout our stay, I noticed her watching me several times. My son told me later that she is scared of me. After prying, I learned how bad her family actually is.

For my birthday, she got me an expensive necklace. I know the brand and there's no way she could afford it. She looked at me so scared and just asked if I liked it. I told her I did. She keeps watching me. 

Now, I worry about where she got the money. Her classes are all remote this semester. She can't decide whether she wants to be with my son or her family. She loves her younger siblings and has all but raised them. Then, her parents kick her out or threaten her.I worry so much about her at home. If she has money to take care of herself and her little siblings. I feel like she got me the necklace to pay me back but she did not need too. I feel so guilty 

Would I be a horrible person if I gave her a some money no questions asked? Or if I got her and her siblings expensive gifts she could sell or gift cards. I don't know if she would. She is not the type to ask for help. I remember my son on the phone for hours trying to find a hotel for her to stay at in the midst of quarantine after what her parents did. I want to make her a bank account or trust fund. I don't know how to do it. I also don't want to embarrass or cause her to fear me. My son says she looks up to me and wants to make me happy. I feel so guilty. I never should have gotten her that necklace when she has trouble feeding and clothing herself and the little ones.

tldr I got my son's girlfriend an expensive necklace. She got me a similar one but I worry about how she can afford it and take of herself and little siblings","I think you should talk to her, maybe even write to her.

My guess is that she doesn't know what to expect from you. So, in my family, there is no such thing as generosity. If a gift seems generous, then there are ALWAYS strings attached. She told your son that she's afraid because she doesn't know what you want from her in return. So she felt obligated to reciprocate the gift evenly because she doesn't have any experience with generosity.

My mother in law is a truly generous woman. And the first Christmas I did with her was incredibly confusing. She gave me SOOO many gifts. And of course I had brought her something, her son helped me pick it out. But it was one gift, and she'd bought me a house full. And because my family does gifting with strings, it was very uncomfortable.

So, my advice is to be very frank with her if you want to buy her any gifts or give her any money. Tell her the real reasons you want to do this for her and ask her if she's comfortable before you give her anything.

relationships,How do I tell my best friend (both F20s) that I want to stop exchanging Christmas presents?,"Throwaway account. TL;DR at end.

My best friend is a really great gift-giver. I know that she plans gifts really far in advance and always dedicates so much time & thought into them, and I am so grateful for every gift I have ever received because I know how special they are. She'll often take something small I said from years back and make a really meaningful thing out it, and I know she enjoys gift giving and it is clearly one of primary ways she communicates her love for me and others. 

I just can't keep up. I've never been a really good gift-giver. I often really struggle with forming ideas for upcoming celebrations, and until I'm really under the pump, I come up empty handed until I find something just alright or I repeat a similar schtick of ""reasons why I value you"" presents. 

This just means that I feel so much stress every time I have to celebrate her birthday & Christmas, especially because I would have received something completely out of this world. I really just feel like my gifts pale in comparison. It's getting to this stage where we've been exchanging presents for 8 years and I'm honestly just starting to feel like I'm running out of steam to keep up and continue thinking of other ideas. It is also hard because I'm neither here nor there when it comes to receiving gifts. I can recognise the hard work and love, but I don't *need* to receive gifts to know that I'm loved, and so I worry that I don't reciprocate my love well enough because my presents never feel at her level. 

I want to express to her my gratitude for her gifts but ask that we just stick to one a year, on birthdays, because Christmas and the occasional Valentines' Day is too much for me. I have been able to move away from gift-giving with other friends by just casually mentioning it or just mutually ceasing present exchanges, and we now opt for spending time with each other - something I love. I just don't know if this would be really insensitive or soul-crushing because it's not about her or how good of a friend she is, but really about my insecurity and my differing ways of communicating love. 

I know I've got to have the conversation, but does anyone have any tips or advice for how I could communicate this in a tactful and non-hurtful way? 

TL;DR: my best friend is a great gift-giver and expresses her love through that, but I don't and so I feel my gifts are incomparable. I want to only exchange presents once a year and opt to spend time with her for other celebrations but don't know how to deliver this in a sensitive and thoughtful way.

Edit: thank you all so much! I'm trying to get around to reading all the comments but I just want to say that I appreciate everyone's perspectives and input. It's really been helpful for me to consider different ways of having the conversation and problem-solving our way to a more mutually agreeable situation. 

Also, yes, she's definitely the Leslie Knope in this instance. Maybe I could suggest ""Knope-resents 2020"" HAHAHA please laugh","""Hey, guys, this year has been unusually rough on everybody's mental health, including mine.  I want to suggest that instead of physical gifts this year we do something special together to celebrate our friendship, like ice skating/spa day/wine tasting/etc [suggest the activity you most would like to do but have a backup just in case].  I can start doing the research now and we can try to plan it for early December?""",2219,141,2020-09-24 13:25:16,iyx7ew
relationships,My boyfriend [29/M] wants to wait to propose to me [29/F] after 8 years,"My boyfriend (29) and I (29) have been together for 8 years. In the past, whenever I would bring up marriage, he would blow off my questions with a joke of something along the lines of ""I don't believe in marriage"". I finally had a conversation with him last year to help clarify if he really meant this or was truly joking. He said he wants to wait until both of us are our best selves. In his case, this meant more financial stability, which he achieved last year with a raise in salary. I was previously really unhappy with my old job and my unhappiness carried over into our relationship, so he was pushing me to switch jobs. I switched jobs in February, but between the current Covid19 situation and having a new manager with unprofessional behavior and gaslighting tactics, I am again stressed out and unhappy. I also gained about 20 pounds at my old job and am not finding success with losing it with how much overtime I still have to do with my new job. He makes comments about my food consumption and about me needing to exercise more.

TLDR: Is 8 years too long? Are we ever going to be our best selves?","The whole ‚Äúbest selves‚Äù thing is a way to keep moving the goal post on you. Especially when he gets to be the judge of what your best self is.


If marriage is important to you, I would not keep waiting on him. Yes, you want to continually work towards improvement but someone shouldn‚Äôt be holding their understanding of ‚Äúyour best self‚Äù over your head in order to move forward with deeper commitment. Especially not after 8 years.",2200,243,2020-04-26 00:42:19,g84v87
relationships,I accidentally exposed my friend for wearing wigs and have put her in the position of either lying or outing herself,"Background: My best friend of 9 yrs, we'll call her Lola, (20F) and I (20F) are quarantining at our apartment together. .She's trans and has had trouble growing her hair out, so she wears wigs. She has some really cute ones in other colors that she wears for fun and stuff, but she has a standard everyday wig she wears most of the time. 

Lola never got the traditional girly childhood, so we've been making one for her in quarantine. We built a fort in the living room, have been making friendship bracelets, playing summercamp-style games. It's a lot of fun!! Last week, Lola mentioned to me that she wanted to start a quarantine diary so that she could document her experiences for future generations. I actually thought it was really cool, and then we got on the topic of journaling and I told her about my first diary - one of those flismy lock diaries that every girl had as a kid.

We bought matching ones as part of our ""give Lola her childhood back"" crusade. They took a little while coming in, but we got them on Friday. Saturday night, some of our friends from college decided to do an impromptu girl's night in. Lola was in the shower, so I answered the Zoom without her. 

Side note: Lola is NOT out to anybody at our college and I respect that. This is her fresh start and she has a right to decide when she wants to come out to these people, if at all. I know I wouldn't 100% trust some of the people at our school with something as personal as this.

We were talking about what we've been doing in quarantine and I mentioned that we had gotten the diaries. I said it was for the nostalgia and they wanted to see the diaries. We left the box in Lola's room, so I went in to show them. Lola and I go into each other's rooms all the time - we're basically sisters to one another, and it's just about second nature. When we were younger, we had keys to each other's houses. I didn't think anything of it.

I flipped the camera to show the diaries and didn't flip it back. I got distracted by a cute choker on her dresser and forgot that the camera was flipped/there was anything to hide. They knew Lola has worn wigs out to parties/the club/etc. but her everyday wig was right out in plain view, and one of our nosier friends asked what the ""new wig"" was. I completely bluescreened and someone else realized that it was Lola's hair. I genuinely had nothing to say. They were asking why Lola wore a wig and I had no explanation. I didn't want to out her.

Someone else came to the conclusion that Lola must have cancer or alopecia or some other horrible thing that causes hair loss. They've decided that she was just too embarrassed to say, and they all started going on about ""poor Lola"" etc. I just didn't know what to say and I said it wasn't my place to confirm/deny. I hung up and immediately told Lola. I apologized profusely, and I know how badly I fucked up. I feel so guilty about it. But, understandably, she's upset.

Now, she's being forced to decide whether or not to out herself. Lola, understandably, doesn't want to lie about having some serious disease and people are already trying to ""show support."" At the same time, though, she doesn't want to have to come out. I don't know wha tto do. I want to support her, but she doesn't want to even see me right now.

TL;DR: I exposed my friend's wigs and have put her in a tough spot. What are good ways to help and support her? Should I try to do damage control and tell people to just butt out? What good can I do in this situation?",Honestly just say what you did here - she wants to have long hair but struggles to grow it out. That's the truth and she doesn't have to deeper than that,2128,106,2020-05-18 07:08:05,glwmns
relationships,UPDATE: Apparently I (F31) married a Narcissist (M35) Original post: My (F31) husband (M34) of 5 years takes me for granted,"Thank you to everyone for your comments on my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/d5my92/my_f31_husband_m34_of_5_years_together_for_9/)(3 months ago). I actually was quite surprised by the resounding gong of how terrible he is and needed a lot of time to digest the responses. My first reaction was that I exaggerated or only put one side into the story and that he isn't really that bad. 

The switch flipped for me after a few series of events in the last 2 months. First I wanted to sign up our oldest child up for a weeknight evening activity. And my husband was not fond of the idea, but when I kept pushing he said if I did signup it was all on me and that I was not ""allowed"" to get frazzled or stressed out on the day of the activity. I realized he doesn't want to signup because he doesn‚Äôt want to change his quality of life. 

Shortly after that, he was travelling for work and I was lying in bed alone and I realized I hadn't gotten my period in a while. Open my app to check when its due, I'M ON DAY 52 OF MY CYCLE! And we had sex immediately before my fertility window. I cannot be pregnant. I panicked. And I didn't even want to tell him. I feared telling him. I still haven't told him 2 months later. (I thankfully just skipped a cycle.)

I started fantasizing what it would look like to split time with our kids. Casually looking for work to see what is out there if/when we break up. And totally talking about it with my girlfriends. 

Then one lunch (in front of the kids) out of nowhere we had a colossal fight (for us). Surprisingly (and quite out of character) I was totally calm. And when he would go at me with ""is this what the next 35 years of our lives will be like?"" I would just say ""I hope not.""  And when he said something about divorce, I just said ""that doesn‚Äôt scare me."" I was solidly expecting to be fighting all Christmas because I really thought the best thing would be to separate. And he now knew that was something I was considering.

A couple hours later he was SUPER sweet. Telling me he'll never stop fighting for us, and that I am the best at everything I do (which is true üòâ ).  And that he just wanted us to be better. That he would be better.  

In the couple days that followed, he said a couple of things to our kids that make me cringe. I'm sure some people parent with shame intentionally but I am NOT okay with it. And I immediately called him on it and told him that was one of the things I did not like. He seems to have taken note and has not done it since. He is taking an interest in an entrepreneurial project of mine, which is a complete 180 from before. It is just an interest when I want to talk about a new idea or spin on something (related to my project) he is mostly dismissive, but will tolerate me talking about it. 

Our 6th anniversary came and went over the holiday break - he remembered a couple days before but did not plan anything. The day of was forgettable. He did however, buy me grocery store flowers and write a nice note in a card.

I still feel skeptical. I‚Äôm hesitant and I don‚Äôt know if this is genuine. We are attending a work conference in a month for his company and I am concerned that his change in attitude is to ‚Äúkeep me in line‚Äù so we present well and I don‚Äôt embarrass him. I feel like he is trying to check the boxes that he thinks will make me happy without actually put in real effort. I also feel like he is trying and I should give him a chance. I don‚Äôt know what to do. 

TLDR: An update to an [old post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/d5my92/my_f31_husband_m34_of_5_years_together_for_9/). Comments made me think that I had exaggerated, until a series of things triggered me to plan to leave (as 90% of comments told me to). When I told him I wasn't scared of divorce and that it had crossed my mind he freaked out, and in 2 hours came back to me that he was going to fight for us, and that we can be better. He has been better, but I  can't seem to shake my hesitation.","I think you should Google the term ""love bombing"". It sounds like he has realized that he's pushed you too far, so he's trying to win you back by being extra ""good"". Eventually he will start to feel complacent and will likely go back to his old ways.

Normally I would recommend marriage counseling, however if you truly believe he is a narcissist then it probably wouldn't be a good idea. He will just use therapy to manipulate you in new ways.",2121,103,2020-01-07 18:30:58,elfi2g
relationships,I'm (27F) buying a house for myself and my boyfriend (33M) of 5 years to live in. He wants his name on the house. I'm not comfortable with that but how can I tell him that without making him feel bad?,"TL;DR I'm going to be the sole party on the mortgage for the property myself and my partner rent. He wants his name on the house and I don't feel comfortable with that. How do I tell him this without hurting his feelings or creating a dispute?

So I'm (27F) buying a house for myself and my boyfriend (33M) of 5 years to live in.

The property we're renting is being sold and I verbally agreed I'd buy it from the landlord. I never even considered that my boyfriend would be involved in the buying process bc my income is enough to get the mortgage, we're not married, he has bad credit. So I was going to have the house in my name with all my debts and finances.

The landlord said he knows we're not married and when it comes down to filling out the paperwork, he doesn't care whose name is on the house. This is my first time buying a house so I think he's talking about the deed. Since my boyfriend heard that, he wants his name on the deed. I think he means both of us but I'm not comfortable with that. 

There are many reasons it's not a good idea but there are very few as to why it might be good. I see it as my house if I'm getting the mortgage. Both of my siblings have bought homes with their partners and it's been the one who has the mortgage that also owns the house. It only makes sense to me. I think I am being practical about the scenario where we don't get married and stay together forever. It could cause legal issues if we're both owners. I don't see myself living here if something like that were to happen, so he could stay and rent from me but I can understand his hesitation to trust that.

But I can't really see it from his side so I can't figure out how to talk to him about it. How do I talk about this? And what I want to say is no, so how can I put put my foot down without causing a dispute?","Under NO circumstances put his name on the deed, unless his name is on the mortgage as well. Otherwise he owns half the house with absolutely none of the financial obligation/responsibility. Worst thing you can do.",2068,274,2020-05-19 17:02:46,gmsjoz
