politics,"James Mattis Denounces President Trump, Describes Him as a Threat to the Constitution",,"A powerful statement by Mattis that makes you understand why he was revered by the military. Here's the text:

**IN UNION THERE IS STRENGTH**

I have watched this week’s unfolding events, angry and appalled. The words “Equal Justice Under Law” are carved in the pediment of the United States Supreme Court. This is precisely what protesters are rightly demanding. It is a wholesome and unifying demand—one that all of us should be able to get behind. We must not be distracted by a small number of lawbreakers. The protests are defined by tens of thousands of people of conscience who are insisting that we live up to our values—our values as people and our values as a nation.

When I joined the military, some 50 years ago, I swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution. Never did I dream that troops taking that same oath would be ordered under any circumstance to violate the Constitutional rights of their fellow citizens—much less to provide a bizarre photo op for the elected commander-in-chief, with military leadership standing alongside.

We must reject any thinking of our cities as a “battlespace” that our uniformed military is called upon to “dominate.” At home, we should use our military only when requested to do so, on very rare occasions, by state governors. Militarizing our response, as we witnessed in Washington, D.C., sets up a conflict—a false conflict—between the military and civilian society. It erodes the moral ground that ensures a trusted bond between men and women in uniform and the society they are sworn to protect, and of which they themselves are a part. Keeping public order rests with civilian state and local leaders who best understand their communities and are answerable to them.

James Madison wrote in Federalist 14 that “America united with a handful of troops, or without a single soldier, exhibits a more forbidding posture to foreign ambition than America disunited, with a hundred thousand veterans ready for combat.” We do not need to militarize our response to protests. We need to unite around a common purpose. And it starts by guaranteeing that all of us are equal before the law.

Instructions given by the military departments to our troops before the Normandy invasion reminded soldiers that “The Nazi slogan for destroying us…was ‘Divide and Conquer.’ Our American answer is ‘In Union there is Strength.’” We must summon that unity to surmount this crisis—confident that we are better than our politics.

Donald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people—does not even pretend to try. Instead he tries to divide us. We are witnessing the consequences of three years of this deliberate effort. We are witnessing the consequences of three years without mature leadership. We can unite without him, drawing on the strengths inherent in our civil society. This will not be easy, as the past few days have shown, but we owe it to our fellow citizens; to past generations that bled to defend our promise; and to our children.

We can come through this trying time stronger, and with a renewed sense of purpose and respect for one another. The pandemic has shown us that it is not only our troops who are willing to offer the ultimate sacrifice for the safety of the community. Americans in hospitals, grocery stores, post offices, and elsewhere have put their lives on the line in order to serve their fellow citizens and their country. We know that we are better than the abuse of executive authority that we witnessed in Lafayette Park. We must reject and hold accountable those in office who would make a mockery of our Constitution. At the same time, we must remember Lincoln’s “better angels,” and listen to them, as we work to unite.

Only by adopting a new path—which means, in truth, returning to the original path of our founding ideals—will we again be a country admired and respected at home and abroad.

politics,Demands for Trump Removal Grow as 'Fascist' Speech Condemned as Declaration of War Against US Public,,"My husband's family is Libyan and he lived there for quite some time under Gaddafi. He says Trump constantly does things that are almost exactly like Gaddafi. Photo ops, demanding praise, making sure his name is associated with stimulus checks, threatening retaliation and demanding acquiescence before providing government support...it all screams of dictatorship and fascism. I don't understand how his supporters or the GOP can just ignore all this. Isn't the right all about less government involvement? You fucking flip out of Costco 'violates your rights' by asking you to wear a cloth on your face but someone literally creating a police state and shooting at you on your property deserves your unwavering support? These people make me sick.

Editing to say: Thanks for the awards. And I'm getting an uncomfortable amount of comments like ""Look at Libya now!"" And ""Gaddafi was a smart, good guy. He wrote books!"" 

Okay, first I didn't compare the two countries at all. Libya is struggling for sure. I was comparing the actual men and their narcissistic, pathological tendencies craving fame and power. Trump idolizes dictators. It's clear he loves Putin. Our Democratic process is the only thing keeping him in check.

 Second, are you kidding me with this shit? Defending Gaddafi, listing his good deeds for me? He lived in a golden palace, his people suffered under the sanctions he brought on the country, they were scared to speak out against him for fear of the retribution that often followed. ""He did good things And the country advanced."" Ok, a parent raises a child and provides basic care, food etc to them. But the parent is a narcissistic psycho who manipulates the kid, beats them, doesn't give them tools or support for a good future...is that parent a good parent? And he wrote books?! Hitler wrote Mein Kampf, did that make him a good guy? WTF?!",95166,81,2020-06-02 13:21:24,gv786w

I wanted Warren. I wanted Bernie over Biden. I wanted several candidates more than Biden. Nonetheless:

**2020 is SO much bigger than Biden**

A 2020 Trump Presidency would mean:

- A conservative judiciary the *rest of your life.* A likely 7-2 SCOTUS, and another [massive chunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_federal_judges_appointed_by_Donald_Trump) of lifetime federal judge appointments.

This means unfavorable rulings for: climate change, abortion, gerrymandering, executive power, executive oversight, Congressional authority, civil rights, immigration issues (children in cages), and so, so much more. You can basically say goodbye to this for decades to come with a Trump Presidency. Everything Bernie, Warren, Democrats, and progressives ever stood for is going to take a sledgehammer with a Trump Presidency.

- It would mean the continuing takeover of an authoritarian rule. Trump has argued he is immune from indictments, from oversight, from the courts, and he has a DOJ and Republican Senate to help him solidify his role as America's King.

- It would mean further emboldening of a worrying white nationalist, conspiratorial presence in America. Racism, sexism, xenophobia, wild conspiracies, and more would be given a green light.

- The continued isolation of America on the world stage. Every country on the planet besides NK, Saudi Arabia, and Russia does. not. trust. us. anymore. We are a mockery on the world stage in everything we do.

- The most corrupt cabinet in history. William Barr, Betsy DeVos, Mnuchin, Wheeler, Pence. It's like a super team of unqualified, horrendous people with enormous conflicts of interest. Every position is basically hired to deconstruct the agency they work for. The intelligence community is being flat-out purged for loyalists.

- A continuing WAR against climate change efforts and science. Undoubtedly the biggest issue humanity, including our children, grandchildren, and beyond will face.

No matter what your criticisms of Biden are,  

Let's remember who Trump is:

-Trump defrauded the government of [$400 million dollars.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-tax-schemes-fred-trump.html?mtrref=undefined&gwh=4C8152465110DAFBB00CA5F605A32C11&gwt=pay&assetType=REGIWALL)

-Trump cheated on his third wife with a porn star and illegally paid her to keep quiet before an election.  
-Trump committed at least [5 felony instances of Obstruction of Justice.](https://medium.com/@dojalumni/statement-by-former-federal-prosecutors-8ab7691c2aa1), including trying to get Mueller (the man investigating him) fired... twice.

-Trump killed a top general of a hostile nation that posed no imminent threat.  
-Trump has [over twenty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_sexual_misconduct_allegations) sexual misconduct/assault allegations.   
-Trump tried to lie about a hurricane by extending a forecast with a [fucking sharpie on a map](https://i.redd.it/yt276gv57tk31.jpg) because he couldn't admit he made a mistake on twitter.

-Trump told a group of minority Congresswomen (3 of which born in America) to [""go back"" to the countries they came from](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/14/us/politics/trump-twitter-squad-congress.html).  
-Trump got on the stage at Helsinki to tell the world [he trusts Vladimir Putin over his own intelligence agencies](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44852812).  
-Trump is [purging the intelligence community](https://www.axios.com/adam-schiff-trump-inspectors-general-ric-grenell-dfa73706-c3f3-4a44-aae3-ec66a86bc30c.html) and replacing the positions with unqualified sycophants.

#The Solutions

#[Defining “Defunding The Police”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ay3tsUjTkyw&t=5s)

1. [De-bundle the police](https://imgur.com/a/r6JA4pL) - Park Rangers are law enforcement but their responsibilities are drastically different than the Police. Homeless outreach, armed response, traffic enforcement, domestic disturbances are all responsibilities that should be given to the correct sectors and the appropriate budget.

2. [End qualified immunity like Colorado](https://www.forbes.com/sites/nicksibilla/2020/06/21/colorado-passes-landmark-law-against-qualified-immunity-creates-new-way-to-protect-civil-rights/#3bfface6378a) -  Which is what practically prevents citizens from being able to sue officers for neglect and misconduct.

3. [Campaign Zero](https://www.joincampaignzero.org/#vision) - A lot of relatively easy (compared to structural changes like #1 or #2) to implement improvements that would increase public trust and officer safety.

*Folks asking me why I'm calling the jobs report fake, and it's because for years under Obama every Republican in the world insisted that ""The unemployment rate isn't really 4.7%, Obama's lying to you, it's much closer to 40%, the jobs report is fake!""  Then, the day Donald Trump took office, the jobs reports were real again and he magically achieved a 4.6% unemployment rate between the time he was inaugurated and his first press conference.  If Joe Biden takes office, and achieves a reasonable unemployment rate (no reason to think he wouldn't) then Republicans will once again return to complaining that the jobs numbers are fake, and unemployment is actually at historically unprecedented levels, they will continue saying this until the next time a Republican wins the Presidential election.

If they pass in 2021, we could see significantly fewer problems in our 2022 midterms.  

Also vote in the 2022 midterms!  If we elect Biden, then let Republicans win the house in 2022 (Like we did with the Tea Party in 2010) we might as well be killing Biden's agenda ourselves.

Attorney General Letitia James claims in a lawsuit filed Thursday that she found financial misconduct in the millions of dollars, and that it contributed to a loss of more than $64 million over a three year period.

The state's top prosecutor said the organization engaged in illegal conduct by diverting ""millions of dollars away from the charitable mission of the organization for personal use by senior leadership, awarding contracts to the financial gain of close associates and family, and appearing to dole out lucrative no-show contracts to former employees in order to buy their silence and continued loyalty.

Architect of the legal fight for women’s rights in the 1970s, Ginsburg subsequently served 27 years on the nation’s highest court, becoming its most prominent member. Her death will inevitably set in motion what promises to be a nasty and tumultuous political battle over who will succeed her, and it thrusts the Supreme Court vacancy into the spotlight of the presidential campaign.

As usual, I would always rather stay and spend my time connecting with you here, however, my campaign manager is telling me it's time to do other things. Please check out my website and social media pages, I look forward to talking with you there!

I am a life-long activist, political organizer, small business owner and mother living in Hallowell, Maine. I am a progressive Democrat running for U.S. Senate, seeking to unseat Republican incumbent Susan Collins. 

Mainers and all Americans deserve leaders who will put people before party and profit. I am not taking a dime of corporate or dark money during this campaign. I will be beholden to you. 

I support a Green New Deal, Medicare for All and eliminating student debt. 

As the granddaughter of a lobsterman, the daughter of a middle school math teacher and a foodservice manager, and a single mom of three, I know the challenges of working-class Mainers firsthand.

I also have more professional experience than any other candidate in this Democratic primary. 

I helped create the first Clean Elections System in the country right here in Maine because I saw the corrupting influence of money in politics and policymaking and decided to do something about it. I ran as a Clean Elections candidate for governor in 2018 -- the only Democratic candidate in the race to do so. I have pledged to refuse all corporate PAC and dirty money in this race, and I fuel my campaign with small-dollar donations and a growing grassroots network of everyday Mainers. 

My nearly 40 years of advocacy accomplishments include:

* Writing and helping pass the first Family Medical Leave Act in the country

* Creating the first Clean Elections system in the country

* Working on every Maine State Budget for 37 years

* Serving as executive director of the Maine Women’s Lobby

* Serving as program coordinator for the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom

* Serving as Commissioner for Women under Governors Brennan and McKernan

* Co-founding the Maine Center for Economic Policy and the Dirigo Alliance
Founding and running my own small advocacy business, Moose Ridge Associates.

* Co-founding the Civil Rights Team Project, an anti-bullying program currently taught in 400 schools across the state. 

* I am also a trainer of sexual harassment prevention for businesses, agencies and schools. 

I am proud to have the endorsements of Justice Democrats, Brand New Congress, Democracy For America, Progressive Democrats for America, Women for Justice - Northeast, Blue America and Forward Thinking Democracy.

> The bill allows a person who has a constitutional right secured by the bill of rights of the Colorado constitution that is infringed upon by a peace officer to bring a civil action for the violation. A plaintiff who prevails in the lawsuit is entitled to reasonable attorney fees, and a defendant in an individual suit is entitled to reasonable attorney fees for defending any frivolous claims. Qualified immunity ~~and a defendant’s good faith but erroneous belief in the lawfulness of his or her conduct are not defenses~~ is not a defense to the civil action. The bill requires a political subdivision of the state to indemnify its employees for such a claim; except that - **if the peace officer’s employer determines the officer did not act upon a good faith and reasonable belief that the action was lawful, then the peace officer is personally liable for 5 percent of the judgment or $25,000, whichever is less, unless the judgment is uncollectible from the officer, then the officer’s employer satisfies the whole judgment.**

I do think this is a step in the right direction long-term because it will force departments to instill & reinforce better De-Escalation training procedures for their officers. Not having quite the safety net will motivate the departments & unions to truly engage and enforce these procedures when on duty.",71010,94,2020-06-19 19:32:36,hc75r4

politics,Bernie Sanders Says U.S. Can Cancel All Student Debt if It Can Give the Top 1% $1 Trillion in Tax Breaks,,"It's never been about whether or not it's possible, it has always been about whether or not they're actually willing to do it.

Free healthcare for all is a thing in many countries. Free college is a thing. Parental leave, paid vacation. Countless things missing in most of the US are a thing in many other countries.

There is absolutely no reason why the US couldn't do the same for its people. It just comes down to whether or not the government is actually willing to provide for the people instead of the top 1%.

**Edit:** To clarify, I understand all the ""free"" stuff comes out of taxes. But the point stands because the tax increase required to cover these expenses is not that large. And as Bernie points out, if the US government can find ways to essentially gift a trillion dollars to the 1% in the form of tax cuts, they can also afford to cancel student debt without raising taxes.

And in regards to healthcare, the fact that health insurance exists in the US and is used not only for covering health care, but also paying for the salaries and office rent and benefits for all those countless thousands of insurance company workers, means that it's actually more expensive than universal healthcare would be, which would send your money almost directly to hospitals. No insurance company middle-men taking a huge cut. So you could still get the exact same health care, but also make sure you fellow man doesn't go bankrupt for life when they're hit by a car during that 1 month they were between jobs and without being able to afford insurance.",69656,193,2020-11-26 14:51:22,k1gh9w

 A group of independent federal watchdogs selected Fine to lead the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee, but Fine's removal from his Pentagon job prevents him from being able to serve in that position — since the law only allows sitting inspectors general to fill the role.

The court in a brief order rejected a request made by U.S. Congressman Mike Kelly, a Trump ally, and other Pennsylvania Republicans who filed a lawsuit after the Nov. 3 election arguing that the state’s 2019 expansion of mail-in voting was illegal under state law.

&nbsp;

>I've been saying this for a while. It's why McConnell refuses to negotiate another covid stimulus bill.
>
>They just ran a $1 trillion deficit, 2 years in a row. It's been higher every year since Trump took office. This years deficit is already $3.5 trillion. The highest ever.

>So if they allow the other stimulus bill to hit, it would be $5-7 trillion.

> &nbsp;

>But, if they can push it off, making the economy tank more, then force Biden to sign that stimulus himself in like February (the new session of Congress will need to repass the Pelosi bill, and go through the discussion and debate processes). 
>
>If they make Biden sign a stimulus that could even clear $4 trillion by then (9-10 months after the dems passed the $3.4 trillion version), then the GOP can immediately start using it as a cudgel. Never mind that in 2020, the GOP ran up the highest deficit in history. Just look at how the Democrats are spending $4 trillion trying to clean up the mess left by Trump.

> &nbsp;

>Then, of course, some Democratic mayor in Cactus Town, middle of nowhere, is going to get caught using those Covid funds for their own business or something, and suddenly Fox, Breitbart, OAN, infowars, etc, will all be climbing all over themselves to say that all Democrats are corrupt, and that ""maybe someone should investigate the allegations that Biden gave Hunter $2 trillion for crack.""

>We've seen them use this same shit show playbook for decades. Sabotage something important, like health care, education, or the economy itself, then call Democrats wasteful for trying to fix it.

politics,Megathread: President Trump Suggests Delaying 2020 Presidential Election,"President Trump on Thursday suggested delaying November’s presidential election.

The dates of federal elections are set by Congress, and the Constitution makes no provisions for a delay to the Jan. 20 inauguration.

Any such move would require a change of federal law, meaning it would need to go through Democrats in the House of Representatives in addition to the Republican-controlled Senate. (The Congressional Research Service actually weighed in on this topic in March, specifically noting that a president has no legal authority to change the date of the election.)

politics,A National Nightmare: Whoever Owns Trump’s Enormous Debts Could Be Running The Country,,"This genuinely scares me:

> One fact stands out far above all the others in its staggering implications: Donald Trump is personally responsible for $421 million worth of loans coming due in the next few years. Not his business. Him. Personally. He has no means of repaying them. He already refinanced his few profitable properties, and sold off most of his stocks to stay afloat. He appears short on liquidity. And we still don’t know to whom he owes the money.
>
>This fact has frightening implications for public policy and national security. Even minor debts are a frequent reason for the government to deny a security clearance, for the obvious reason that indebted and financially desperate public servants make easy marks for bribery, blackmail and potential treason. The potentially destructive power of that sort of hold on a President of the United States is beyond comprehension. It is the stuff of nightmares, bad spy movie plots and otherwise outlandish conspiracy theory. Imagine if a president owed millions to the mob or to those with close ties to a foreign government, and those individuals both controlled the president’s financial future and knew of corrupt criminal activity. The president might act with otherwise strange deference to said mobsters and those connected to them, and bend public policy on their behalf. If they were tied to fossil fuel interests, the president might set the globe on fire rather than cross them. If his creditors were simply a wealthy set of Wall Street tycoons, he might rig all financial policy on their direct behalf.
>
>What we do know is that beginning in the late 2000s, no one would lend to Donald Trump. His history of bankruptcies, combined with whatever horrors were on his personal and organizational financial statements, clearly made every bank run the other direction. Every bank but one, that is: Deutsche Bank. Donald Trump’s history with Deutsche Bank has always merited special scrutiny, but never more than now. The head honchos at Deutsche would have known just how desperate Trump’s financial position was. But they lent to him anyway. Why? It certainly looks even more ominous that Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy’s son was managing the real estate division at Deutsche that lent to Trump, and that Justice Kennedy unexpectedly retired to ensure Trump could seat his replacement. And it looks triply suspicious that Deutsche Bank has been fined and sanctioned over multiple money laundering scandals, including $20 billion from Russian kleptocrats.",65368,106,2020-09-28 10:08:17,j19bla
politics,"Trump's last-minute pardon spree shows why Joe Biden just can't ""move on"".

>Soon after he offered public assurances that the government was ready to battle the coronavirus, the powerful chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Richard Burr, sold off a significant percentage of his stocks, **unloading between $582,029 and $1.56 million** of his holdings on Feb. 13 in 29 separate transactions....Burr is not a particularly wealthy member of the Senate: **Roll Call estimated his net worth at $1.7 million in 2018**, indicating that the February sales significantly shaped his financial fortunes and spared him from some of the pain that many [Americans](https://www.tripsnek.com) are now facing.

Richard Burr is 64 years old. If he had anything remotely resembling an [appropriate risk allocation](https://smartasset.com/investing/asset-allocation-by-age) for his age (about 35% in the stock market), those transactions likely represent **every penny he had invested in the stock market**.

“They need that money in order to make the Post Office work so it can take all of these millions and millions of ballots,” Trump said on Fox Business Thursday morning of the states that are implementing universal mail-in voting ahead of the November election. “But if they don’t get those two items that means you can’t have universal mail-in voting.”",65166,116,2020-08-13 13:23:06,i8ztlq
politics,Megathread: US Government Accountability Office finds Trump administration violated the law by freezing Ukraine aid,"Today, the US Government Accountability Office issued a legal decision concluding that the Office of Management and Budget violated the law when it withheld approximately $214 million appropriated to DOD for security assistance to Ukraine. The President has narrow, limited authority to withhold appropriations under the Impoundment Control Act of 1974. OMB told GAO that it withheld the funds to ensure that they were not spent ""in a manner that could conflict with the President’s foreign policy."" The law does not permit OMB to withhold funds for policy reasons.
