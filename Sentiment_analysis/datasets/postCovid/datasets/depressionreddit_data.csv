depression,"Isn't it amazing that everyone who's never had depression, or lives an extremely happy and successful life tries to tell you how to cure depression :)","It's always some great 1 off line that they think is the secret to fixing everything.


""Just love yourself!"" - Sure let me just go do that real quick.


""You have so much more time, things will get better!"" - Lot more time for things to get worse too :)


""You'd be disappointing your family, etc"" - Ah yes, by trapping me in the hypothetical mental state of permanently worrying about others over myself, I now get to live a happy and successful life, thank you.



Really appreciate it, thank you.",That's because people who have never been depressed think depression is just being sad...and just sadness is easy to cure.,3430,127,3/16/2021 3:27,m5zy12
depression,I hate 'foggy brain syndrome',"Does anyone else feel like their mind isn't as sharp as it used to be? Back when I was a kid, I was actually able to focus on things and had a pretty good memory. Now, it's like I'm on permanent autopilot. I rarely ever take note of my surroundings or have clear inner monologue. I'm always stuck in this half-awake state where I can't focus on multiple things at once and just kind of ""zone out"" so to speak. I also tend to forget things really quickly for some reason.

It makes me feel like some useless, brain-dead retard that can't even function normally or think basic thoughts. It's as if my cranium is rotting away or something. I'm stuck with permanent brain fog and there's nothing I can do about it. I take antidepressants and vitamin d pills, I drink lots of water, I eat healthy, but nothing works. 

I hate the fact that my brain will never work the same way again, all because of depression. It's destroying my life and I can't take it anymore.

Edit: In case anyone is curious, I don't do drugs or drink alcohol, nor am I old. I'm just a depressed 22 year old dude.",you‚Äôre describing exactly what i‚Äôm going through,3416,198,2/9/2021 21:16,lgdpee
depression,I think that the worst part of depression is that every day you just wait for the day to end cause that's all you have,"The point I realised that I think I collapsed in some way. That I only live from one day to another. That maybe my suicidal tendencies are just wanting to stop that cycle which slowly rots my mind.

If anything in life actually makes sense.","I feel that way while at work, I just want the damn day to end as fast as possible.. then I get home and although I'm still not happy per se, I don't want the day to end.. then it's over too soon and I know I have to sleep and go back to work again to repeat the cycle",3056,60,2/18/2021 17:15,lmrsbh

depression,Nostalgia Is Not As Pleasant When You're Depressed,"For most people nostalgia is generally accepted as being a nice feeling, a pleasant memory.

Edit: I genuinely didn't expect so many kind comments even on a sub like this. I feel better and I have you all to thank for that.",I know exactly how you feel. I'd kill to go back to those days of running around the forest in my old neighborhood with all my old friends. We've all gone our separate ways.

depression,Does anyone else start sobbing when they think of how much they missed out on because of their depression?,"I feel like my depression took my entire teen years from me. I spent all my free time in high school crying and self harming at home while everyone else had friends and hobbies and went to parties. Then I did the same thing in college. I didn‚Äôt even move out from my parents house because I was too anxious to stay in a dorm. My ex used to tell me about how much fun they had in high school and how they were in a bunch of clubs and how they had the most fun in college staying in dorms with all their friends and doing fun, dumb stuff. It always destroys me to think about how I missed out on all of that because of something I couldn‚Äôt control. Now I‚Äôm 21 and just graduated college and I‚Äôm lost. I have no friends, no partner, no job, me and my family are on rough terms and I just got diagnosed with anorexia. It is just crushing me and idk what to do anymore. And I‚Äôm afraid to tell anyone because I don‚Äôt want to be sent back to a psych ward since I have no money to pay for it again. I‚Äôm just so broken right now. Can anyone relate to this crippling regret of missing out on what were supposed to be the best years of your life?","It troubles me a lot. Thinking about what could have been if only I wasn't feeling so anxious and depressed all the time, totally missed out on being a stupid teenager. I kept telling my self that it would get better, but it has seemingly just gotten worse over the years. I don't know fam, going to a therapist soon... Fingers crossed.

It always gets better for a bit, or I start to look forward to things, but clearly there‚Äôs no point to hoping if it all crashes and crumbles. If you don‚Äôt look forward to anything, you can‚Äôt be let down.","Life becomes the pendulum between being depressed or not being depressed. In that sense depression becomes theme of our life even if we are not depressed at that moment. You want real joy or happiness? No, best we can do is a relief from depression in some intervals where you can see how being normal feels like.",2609,76,11/9/2021 15:33,qq67ab
depression,Nobody warns you that depression makes you an awful person to be around,"I didn‚Äôt even realise it myself until I took 2 tabs of acid and could look in at my life from an outside perspective, I‚Äôm awful to be around. I suck the energy out of every situation, I‚Äôm no fun, I‚Äôm never in the mood for laughing because I just constantly feel like crying. I‚Äôm like a black hole that sucks all the fun away and everyone on the outside just sees someone who‚Äôs constantly in a bad mood, there goes any chance of potential new friends approaching me. I wondered why people leave you during depression but I got it after that, I wouldn‚Äôt want to be around me either.","During my most recent depression I was abandoned by the people in my life I hold dearest to my heart and consider them my reason for living. I have unresolved abandonment issues starting early on in life. I know I suck, but it just makes things so much worse when people give up on you.",2568,107,10/23/2021 0:20,qdtvsd
depression,Anger as a symptom of depression need to be recognized more,"Depression isn‚Äôt just being depressed all the time. Anger and feeling numb is also a big part of it. Before I was diagnosed, I was a lot to handle. I would get angry for no reason and destroyed my things as an ineffective coping mechanism. I even went as far as assaulting my mom once but luckily, I have a mother who was nice enough to not press charges and encouraged me to go into therapy. I now know better ways to handle my anger. Of course most angry people arent depressed (some people are just miserable) but depressed people are often angry. Also I‚Äôm not excusing my past actions I just did what I did and I can‚Äôt take it back","I have what's called smiling depression but I also get angered or irritated very easily and I can't even explain why.

depression,I wasn't built for this life! Every time I think about a job or career I get the urge to cry!,"I hate working, I do believe I may be lazy but, I also hate the idea of wasting my life on something I'm not passionate in. I have no passions for existing, I'm just here because I don't want to hurt my family. They'd be devastated if I committed suicide. I try to work and it's getting to the point where I'll last a day or two then I just stop going. They say ""you not supposed to like your job or career but, money money money"". Nobody asked to be a wage slave to maintain a living! I don't know what to do I'm 25 with no goals, two semesters of college that I got a 1.5 gpa in. I kept having panic attacks especially during exams. I wasn't built for this life!","You sound like me. I'm already 24 and I constantly feel like a failure because I didn't pick up working right out of college. Since hiring was slow due to the pandemic I figured I could take time to figure out what I wanted to do with my life, and I still haven't figured it out after a year of soul searching. I feel like my whole future hinges on the path I choose. It's a catch 22 for me. If I want to ever have a family or be valued as a man I have to work in a career that will make me miserable most likely. If I work in a career that's less miserable I'll probably be paid far less and won't be able to support a family.",2538,110,6/5/2021 17:36,nt0zcr
depression,I don't want to die or live. I just want to stop existing and disappear from everyone's memories,It's a pain to live and I don't want my loved ones to feel a little bit of sadness for my suicide. I know they don't care but...

depression,"Everyone says you should talk about what's bothering you, but when you finally find the courage to say anything, the response is so bad that you promise yourself to never open up again","Finally opened up a little to my teacher about how I was feeling and she told me I was childish and ""giving off helpless vibes""

depression,I hate that depression can just ‚Äúsleep‚Äù for a while and then come back up full force.,"I was doing well until last week when I started sleeping 12 hours again, not eating then over-eating, feeling exhausted at the idea of a shower, crying, being irritable, all of the textbook signals of depression. I‚Äôm pushing my partner away and isolating again. 

I‚Äôve been suddenly reminded depression never goes away, it just lays dormant until it decides to come back, at least in my case. I get my hopes up that I‚Äôve ‚Äúfigured it out,‚Äù and am brutally reminded that I haven‚Äôt and never will. 

I‚Äôm just tired & very, very sad. I‚Äôm sorry for complaining.

As soon as I thought it, it hit me how unwell I feel and am. We really spend alot of our time just thinking of dying.","I know we are all sick. I definitely know I am not right. It's way past a bad day, week, month, year, decade, etc. Most people might have a bad day but for us it's our default status and we just want it to go away but it won't. That's what I hate about it. Other people think we can just snap out of it because they have a bad day and watch a comedy or eat ice cream and they're over it. But, we watch that comedy and eat ice cream and nothing changes. We still feel crappy. That's when I knew it was more serious when it never went away; at least never for very long.

depression,I think my wife saved my life this morning.,"I have severe anxiety. Taking meds, but they‚Äôve kind of stopped working like they used to. Got into a conversation with my wife yesterday and I mentioned ‚Äúif I were to be in a place where I could just sit still and not have my brain worry about something, I don‚Äôt know what I would do with myself.‚Äù Anyway, I don‚Äôt get into depressive moods too often anymore,  it this morning, 3 days before our 5th anniversary vacation (we never take vacations. Never have the money.) I check my bank account and realize that all of the bills I had planned to come out last week all hit at once and put our account into the negative. By quite a bit. I panicked. My wife had been looking forward to a small trip to Chattanooga to just relax for MONTHS. The kid was to stay at my parents house and we were just going to relax for a few days. When I realized I
messed up the timing on our bills, I spiraled. I absolutely lost control and cried. Lost it. It was probably the worst I have ever felt. I was crying for about 10 minutes when I suddenly had this sense of calm wash over me. Suicide. Easy. I got out of bed, suddenly stoped crying, cleaned my face up and began getting dressed. I told my wife I was going out for a little while. She knew something was going on and refused to let me leave the house. She physically grabbed me, made me look her in the eyes and told me everything was fine. It brought me out of my head. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs something that I would have gone through with, but in that moment it was the most ok I had ever been with the idea of suicide. We still don‚Äôt have the money for the trip, but that‚Äôs ok. I know I have someone looking out for me. 

Sorry for the rambling, but I figured I just needed to get it out of my head.","That's the thing with depression, every single problem, big or small, hits like a damn atomic bomb and every time it feels like the end.  Stay strong man.",2342,58,2/3/2021 2:27,lbdal4

I am really not doing well isolated in quarantine and I get text conversations are the lowest form of communication. but it's all we got in these times. (I am in Michigan with the highest current covid cases in the US, and seeing people isn't really an option).

I even texted my friend (who I was just Bestman for in October) that I am not doing well and really need to talk to someone and he has ghosted me. Many of these friends come to me when they are alone, depressed, or need advice. (Also he is the most glued to his phone type of person I have ever met). 

I am in therapy, and I get like regular people aren't qualified to discuss these topics sometimes and feel uncomfortable about the topic, but I guess I had hoped one of my friends would listen. I am feeling extra bad that I have to literally pay someone to listen to me, makes me wonder if I am insufferable.",I‚Äôve done the exactly same thing with one girl who used to be a best friend of mine. She would always comes to me when she was depressed and I‚Äôd help her for as long as she needed me. I told her one day I needed help and she completely ignored me. A few days past of regular conversations and then she came to me I helped her back. And again for the second time I said I wasn‚Äôt doing well. Ignored yet again. I confronted her about it and she got so mad and offended. Can‚Äôt believe that was her response especially after all the times I was there for her. We‚Äôre still not friends anymore 5 years later.

It's a dangerous slope and it got me to the edge. I shared that with my family and friend because there was nothing to lose at this point. I still don't know what I want or why but I keep rolling, hoping it'll lead me to a better place.",2122,59,3/13/2021 15:47,m48twp
depression,The fact that I'm supposed to keep living and I'm not allowed to kill myself annoys me honestly.,"If I don't wanna keep going why should I? I had no choice in my birth and I don't have a choice really in my death either. I mean I could off myself but no one would really respect my choice. I don't know, I don't get much joy out of life. I never really had much of a chance to, I get some but I don't know if it's worth going on and on forever. I hate all of the obligations there are to stay alive. I stay alive mostly for other people, I know that's important. I wish I could be selfish and die. I used to think growing up that once my parents both died I'd just kill myself too, I feel like that might still be a good plan for me. 

I have goals and desires, as well as things I want to do. But I also don't really enjoy life. This is all selfish I'm aware. Perhaps it's wrong of me to think this way but I feel resentment towards my existence. Resentment towards the obligations and feelings I hold towards others. Resentment of my love for them and their love for me. I daydream about becoming a major asshole to everyone, just so I can off myself and have people celebrate my death. But I also can't bring myself to be a jerk.","It's so annoying. Why do I need to be here and bust my ass for a fucking system the sets me up for failure. 

I'm so tired of moving every year, having shitty landlords, toxic roommates, and jobs that dont pay me enough to fucking pay rent let alone save enough to buy my own place. And why the fuck would I want to buy my own place? Be in debt for 30+ years with weird incidentals that's are hundreds if not thousands of dollars when still... NO ONE WILL PAY ME A LIVING WAGE. I have a degree, but corporate companies are so toxic. I genuinely lost my fucking mind because of one last year and now I'm losing my mind because what the fuck else am I supposed to do?

depression,"I called the suicide hotline, the lady seemed irritated and then abruptly put me on hold.","I‚Äôve been very depressed and having intrusive thoughts. I had a big panic attack at like 4:30am and no friends were awake to call at that hour, so I went on a limb and I called the suicide hotline.

I told her I have been depressed for a long time, my life, finances, family, job, everything is going terribly. I keep having the thought that it‚Äôd just be easier to end it all. I‚Äôve been abusing alcohol heavily as well. 

She recommended therapy. I said I was going to therapy for a while, but it was expensive and didn‚Äôt seem to help at all so I stopped going.

‚ÄúUm, you can afford alcohol but you can‚Äôt afford therapy?‚Äù She audibly scoffed into the phone and put me on hold indefinitely. Eventually I hung up.

Yes. I am a mess, lady. That‚Äôs why I called! I left the conversation feeling so much more shitty about myself.

And yet I'm still always tired. I still don't enjoy anything. I still feel like the useless little shit I was before. It's just wake up, do my routine, go to sleep, repeat.

I suppose I could reach the other end of life without taking shortcuts like this. But fuck me, is it the best I can ever hope for? To just to sort of keep going?  Why should I put in so much work for so little payoff???

depression,Just because someone has it worse doesn‚Äôt make your pain unjustified.,"I hate when people say something along the lines of, ‚ÄúThis guy got through this, so you‚Äôll be fine.‚Äù When someone is going through tough times in their lives, that is the last thing they‚Äôd want to hear. It makes me feel like shit and I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs the same for them. It‚Äôs toxic and it won‚Äôt make someone who‚Äôs depressed feel any better if not worse. Think of it as, ‚ÄúBeing stabbed by a knife hurts as much as being stabbed by a sword.‚Äù Just because the blades smaller doesn‚Äôt mean it doesn‚Äôt hurt. The only reason I‚Äôm posting it here is because I hear this toxic shit everywhere. I get it if they are trying to comfort you and they don‚Äôt know what to say, but I would think they‚Äôd understand it wouldn‚Äôt make it any better just because some other guy had it worse.

While yes it can bring someone who‚Äôs whining about something trivial to perspective, there‚Äôs a line that‚Äôs crossed when you tell something like that to someone who‚Äôs actually going through depression/tough times.

It only makes me feel worse when I hear this, so if you are going through depression/tough times how would you respond to this? I honestly don‚Äôt know how and it makes me feel like shit and that me having gone through depression was something meaningless.","Totally agree.  **Objectively** correct but **subjectively** your own experience is always more real, more painful.",2093,74,5/24/2021 15:44,nk0xpn
depression,I struggle to even find the motivation to sit on my ass and play video games,Most of the time I lay in bed hoping to fall asleep (username checks out). Everything feels so pointless.,"Man, I relate to that. Depression sucks. I can't enjoy even fun things. I can't sit still to watch movies on Netflix, can't even enjoy tasty foods.

depression,Just because my depression started during the pandemic doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm depressed because of the pandemic.,"I‚Äôm tired of everyone acting like my depression will go away when the pandemic ends as if I‚Äôm just a little down because of the pandemic. People get depression all the time. Millions of people are depressed, and their depression starts at all different times. I would have been depressed regardless of the pandemic. Not every person who became depressed during the pandemic is just a little down because of the pandemic. 

I have struggled with mental health my whole life. I have diagnosed anxiety which I have had since I was very young, and now I have been diagnosed with depression. Mental illnesses have run in my family for several generations. Other factors in my life have left me susceptible to depression too. I do not care about going to restaurants or going to the movie theatre. I see my friends at school and I still have to fake a smile around them before I go home utterly exhausted from it. This isn‚Äôt me just being a little sad over the pandemic because I miss my friends or going out. This is me being clinically depressed. 

Do people think that people just stopped getting actual depression as soon as the pandemic started? What I have isn‚Äôt the same as someone else who feels a little down because they miss going to parties.","My depression started well before the pandemic, but I didn‚Äôt even realize it UNTIL the pandemic so people still thought it was cuz of the pandemic. -.-",2055,51,4/5/2021 22:46,mkx1uq
depression,I‚Äôve been staying up until 5am playing video games and then sleeping until 3-4pm everyday,"I have no desire to get up earlier and do something with my day even though if I could force myself I‚Äôd probably feel better. 

It starts to get dark within an hour of waking up usually and it‚Äôs so depressing but it keeps me isolated in my ‚Äúcomfort zone‚Äù 

Being up in the middle of the night feels freeing for some reason, no one awake, no guilt for responsibilities, I can sleep away the day and not feel guilty about it.

But I‚Äôm wasting time and I want more than anything to feel okay again. I want to start to get my life back to something that I can derive some genuine enjoyment out of and move forward with productive things. 

I became depressed again about 10 months ago since my mom passed and these past 10 months have gone by so fast, I‚Äôm almost 26 and I‚Äôm scared at how fast time is moving without any stability forming in my life. 

TLDR: I‚Äôm 25 and I feel like I‚Äôm wasting time, which I am. But it‚Äôs so hard to even attempt to start getting my life in order. 

It feels so far out of reach","I've been doing the same thing. Night feels so peaceful with no pressure, I don't want to sleep and then have to be awake during the day when people can see me.

I used to go for long walks everyday with some loud music I like and that would help a lot, but since pandemic hit I haven't been able to do that, and started going to bed later and later. Now I wait till after sun rise cuz it's when people start getting up. 

My mind keeps reminding me ""time to sleep!"" but at the same time also giving excuses ""Just this one more quest and I'll go""

It doesn‚Äôt stop. It never fucking does. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm haunted by my relatively uneventful past.

No more mistakes. No more disappointments. I‚Äôm tired, I‚Äôm tired of being tired, and I‚Äôm tired of being tired of being. I‚Äôm not suicidal, yet at the same time, I feel like I‚Äôm just one bad day from doing myself in; however, I could never do that to my friends and family. It‚Äôs a weird fucking feeling.

You don't need to pay to kill yourself, but you need to pay to live. It's the easy way out, the only beautiful way out.

I always think of suicide compared to dying of old age. Alot of time elderly people are suffering and hurting and in misery. And when they pass, everyone says how they are in a better place now. They aren't suffering or hurting or in misery. Well sometimes we as people are in misery, hurting, and in alot of pain.

I don't want to hear the same bullshit about loving myself. I barely even have the energy to write well. I want to vent about how much I hate myself. How FUCKED UP I am.

I've lost 10 years, maybe more than that to porn addiction. I don't know if I walked in on my parents or if I was exposed to sexuality at a young age. But I've been masturbating since long before I even hit puberty. And then I discovered porn. Which leads me to now. A porn addict trying to break his habits by only masturbating 3 days a week... and then that's only turned into masturbating *multiple* times a day. It's fucked my relationships up. I can make friends, guys call me cool and women call me sweet. But I just... I'm too scared to escalate sexually and romantically. I can't stand up for myself so people walk over me. I'm afraid of taking risks. I'm a virgin at almost 23. I do not have a car, can't even drive. Never held down a job. Trying to lose weight but making no progress. Never been to a bar. Only been to one party. Never hooked up. Never had a relationship. The only things I have going for me are my writing and my drawing, and even then I'm losing interest in those as well. I don't blame women. I don't blame men either. It all lies with me.

My family isn't any better. I've tried talking about this to them multiple times. I can predict exactly what they say: ""this too shall pass"", ""believe what you want to believe"" ""if you believe it won't happen, it won't."" Yeah, great. Thanks for the ""help."" And then there's the verbal abuse from my narcissistic shrew of a mother and the complete apathy of my father, who constantly tells me he'll have my back but never seems to step up when I truly need him... but he IS happy to yell at and threaten me every time I try standing up for myself against my mother. Every time I try to leave, they threaten to call the cops. I have nowhere to go, no source of income.

I am a fucked up, broken, weird piece of trash who drags the few people who care for him down with his negativity. They're better than me, none of them deserve me. I feel this void in the center of my stomach and heart wherever I go, and now that I've spent all day reading through reddit (seriously, every time these moments of depression happen, ***EVERY*** post I see has to be about sex and dating and relationships), I feel even worse. So much worse than yesterday. I can't forgive myself for the thing's I've done in the past. I sabotage myself every single time. In my worst moments I have these thoughts, these fucking FANTASIES of tying a wire to my neck and the other end to a car, and then letting the wire hang me and hopefully cutting my head off.

All I do is exist. I can't live like this. Normally I don't feel suicidal. But now the thoughts are coming back. Wanna know the funny thing? If I die, people will just go ""that sucks, pass the apple juice"", chalk me up to a statistic, and forget. Because nobody gives a shit about worthless men who can't keep up with the rest of them.

I don't even know why I wrote this. Nobody is going to notice or care. People rarely do anyways.

It sounds like you are making an effort to pass and if you did your best, that is all you can do. I am glad you are still here, and please, if you have any more suicidal thoughts PLEASE talk to someone you can trust,  call the suicide hotline etc. Also, do you have a therapist, if not could you maybe see if your parents could get you one?

School is not everything. If you don't plan to go to college, get a GED and then find a job doing something you enjoy and move on with your life.

depression,"""You're so quiet"" is the biggest annoyance ever and makes me want to flip my shit","As a quiet person who's dealt with many mental health issues, and is generally stuck inside my own head, I enjoy being quiet, observing a lot, and not being a socially obnoxious twat who feels the need to speak just because. Why do people act like being quiet is a weird thing? Just annoys the hell out of me and makes me instantly dislike the person, that's all rant over.","I relate to this so much. I‚Äôm pretty talkative with my friends and people I trust but I often get quiet especially when I‚Äôm in a depressive episode or have high anxiety. People who don‚Äôt know me well will say ‚Äúyou‚Äôre so quiet‚Äù, and it‚Äôs like thanks bro, I do not want to talk to you",1771,94,7/25/2021 21:24,orkcnb
depression,Depression has made me so dumb,"I used to be so smart, at the top of my class. I had so much promise. But now I struggle with basic human functions and social interactions. Depression has made is so hard for me to focus on anything be it school, work, or even just taking care of myself. 

I feel like my mind is stuck in the past just replaying all the regrets and failures of my lifetime this leaving no room for any new information, new skills, or new ambitions. It's like a mold festering over mind, slowly shutting off parts of my brain untill I'm braindead with no option but to end it. does anyone relate?",[deleted],1746,80,7/16/2021 2:04,ol77tc
depression,Do you feel like the only way to get rid of your depression is to cut off all contact with society and do whatever makes you happy,"I just want to go away into nature with my girlfriend and just enjoy life together instead of being stuck with my toxic family and having to work for 20-30 years just to save up money to retire
also shallow people who only care about the things they own, appearance and pleasure - they make me feel sick for whatever reason","I pretty much did this.  Moved across the country, paid cash for a Victorian house by the lakeshore.  Make art and sell it online.  Make my own hours.  Sleep super late and work nights because I'm a night owl.  All this...and I'm still depressed.  So getting everything you want is not always the answer.  Sometimes depression has nothing to do with your life and what you do with it.  Not to say you shouldn't strive to follow your dream.  You should seek therapy if you haven't yet(and possibly meds.)  Good luck to you.",1748,78,8/17/2021 20:24,p6bpd4

Used to be terribly sensitive when I was a child...a few decades of depression (starting in my mid-teens), some other events in my life of which a few were horrific, & learning a bit about how the world works & what humanity is really like has removed most of it. A minor degree of sensitivity is an inevitable part of being human.

The best advice I have is to understand that other people's opinions about you usually don't matter. _They are not_ living your life & so have no personal stake in it, but _you_ are. Unless someone else is paying you a wage or salary, has something you want or need, or is someone you care about & who cares for you in return, then his/her opinions or thoughts aren't worth a jar of cold piss. Remember that.",1692,56,1/2/2021 21:28,kp66b8

depression,I know the post will go down here ... But I have serious problems. I should quit my life.,"First of all ... I have hesitated for a long time just to write everything that burdens me, but maybe it helps just to get rid of everything once. 

About me, 31 years old, I am psychologically completely broken and physically unfortunately also very lediert. 

My life has just gone wrong from the beginning and sometimes I wonder if some people are just lucky and others are not. 

I grew up in an already broken family. My mother was married 3x and divorced 3x (I am the child of the second husband). I can remember almost all the incidents of my childhood (which makes it worse for me) One of the first memories I have (about 3,5 years) my father went after my mother with a knife. And even stabbed through a door with a knife. He was then thrown out by my grandparents and I saw him only once a short time later. He was an alcoholic all his life and did not even try to contact me (even when my ex-wife met him by chance in the hospital 10 years ago and gave him my cell phone number...). Without my knowledge)

In the meantime he passed away about 2 months ago and I knew nothing about him except that he was an alcoholic. 

After he was no longer there, my mother had quickly met someone new, my stepfather. He was 8 years younger than my mother. 

Unfortunately, he was also very aggressive. As a chain smoker he was very quickly annoyed when he had no more cigarettes and has quickly become with things around him, it also did not take long and my mother and he have often and loudly quarreled, often thrown on dishes on the walls. He became unfortunately also now and then Handgreiflich and has beaten me and my brother (whereby my brother was rather his favorite, since he was older and could make more with him). After we have moved several times we lived in a townhouse only then it did not take long that my mother and my stepfather have also divorced. My stepfather had cheated on my mother for a long time with my cousin (yes it does not get better).

After the separation, my stepfather has emptied the joint account and has filed for bankruptcy, because no one could keep the house alone, my mother also had to file for bankruptcy. 

Shortly after that we moved of course, unfortunately my mother lost her job 3 years later and has never found a full-time job again and lives since then on social benefits. 

With my brother (child of my first husband and 3 years older than me) I never had a really good relationship, mostly he didn't want to have anything to do with me and we generally did less together. He was also not at the same school as me, he was never very educated unfortunately. 

He also moved out quite early, because he did not get along with our mother at all and even resented that she separated from our stepfather (because he got along with him). He then moved to another cousin of ours until he was 18 and even had contact with our stepfather. 

Generally he was always very strange. He watched our parents having sex or generally our mother taking a shower. (And played with himself while doing so). He is also said to have had sex with our cousin according to a friend of his. (Probably several times) And has often set fire with a friend together.

He somehow had a kind of mother complex and for many years always looked for much older women who often also had children. But usually it did not last very long. When it was over, he often set a fire somewhere. What I knew about afterwards was his own car, A garden shed, A meadow, and finally an attic of an apartment building, whereupon he was arrested and sentenced. However only on probation. 

His last partner was 11 years older than him with whom he actually held out for 6 years. Only a short time later he had a partner 11 years younger (a complete change of heart). Which was then suddenly pregnant immediately, after the first child a few weeks later she was pregnant again. 

However I had in the people 10 years very very rarely contact with my brother and we have seen us actually only when our grandparents died (who have reached a proud age 92 and 94).

In general, I have also completely broken off contact in the meantime, because after several attempts on my part, no normal relationship can develop between us. I can not even have a reasonable conversation with him, because you just notice he seems to be very stupid (I just can not express it differently).

About me .. I also made a lot of mistakes in life. 

Unfortunately for me, I almost didn't focus on my schooling and did almost nothing in class (my mom didn't care what I did or didn't do anyway, she never showed up for a parent-teacher conference either). 

I wanted to earn money as fast as possible and learned the next best thing and ended up in the camp. My goal though was to become a soldier and joined the army after my training, unfortunately I got a slipped disc there and dropped out 2 years later. 

Then I ended up in a larger company where I had worked until today. 

I started drinking myself very early (15 years), because I myself had a very bad environment, the city I lived in generally had high unemployment and there was a lot of drug dealing. Also through my education I drank almost every day after work and it was later to the point that I completely shut down 4 times a week and had a blackout several times. This was no better in the armed forces. Was able to make the leap in my mid 20's though and quit. I don't even drink beer in between anymore because I just don't feel like it. I also take my other drugs (although I sometimes wonder if maybe I should). Or smoke either.

I have always tried in my life to escape into some relationships, because I could not be alone ... My first relationship lasted 5 years circa and I was married myself and had to divorce and have a son. 

My ex-wife, however, always wanted to make life difficult for me and I got deeply into debt because of her, since she, among other things, never completed an education. Just like that, she quit her jobs and I was the sole breadwinner and often signed contracts and did not pay them, whereupon I received debt collection letters. 

I had to declare insolvency at some point, because we also had a joint loan running.

I had also met a new woman half a year later and moved. Only my ex-wife really sabotaged this relationship and it didn't last long. Also because I wanted to see my son regularly.

I then decided to stay alone for 2 years, but lived near my ex-wife again because of my son. 

When I met my current partner, I decided to finally live my own life and not always be there for others. And moved a little further away. Got another wonderful daughter and everything looked like it was going uphill.

Also this time my ex-wife has tried to make our life hell, which led to the fact that I have quarreled with my partner very often and now also have no contact with my son for a year. 

My job has also deteriorated more and more, because the company was bought up 3x and changed. The work climate has made me more and more broken and I had a second herniated disc. 

In addition, I was then admitted to a day clinic, because I was also psychologically at the end. After a few months there, I was diagnosed with trauma therapy and was also diagnosed with bipolar narcism. 

I discontinued this therapy a year later because it didn't help me at all.

In the meantime, however, I have screwed everything up ... I had to give up my job for health reasons, although I have a GDB of 30% and was equalized. I am also about to lose my partner, because there is more and more crisis between us. I really don't have anyone in my life anymore. 

I have moved 13 times in my life in general. And have lost a lot of contacts and friends. I also lost some contacts because of my ex-wife. 

I generally only have contact with some friends I met online or old work colleagues. 

I also see my mother about 1-2 times a year but I don't care if I see her at all or not. But she understandably wants contact with her grandchildren.

I must also say to myself, I was a very difficult personality from a certain point and also my friends and partners had to learn to deal with it. I always had the urge to somehow talk nonsense and can hardly ever stay serious about anything, even when I write this text. You could subordinate it under ""joke addiction or Moria"". I also have a very low frustration threshold and go crazy quickly if I just drop something. Unfortunately I'm also very forgetful and often don't know what I'm supposed to do several times a day. (I probably owe that to the alcohol). All in all, due to narcism I often have the impression of being emotionally dead. I cry in the rarest situation at all (even if sad videos still carry me away). I can hardly show empathy towards others. I also really don't care about much and I notice it more and more. That I really don't care about anything that happens. Apart from my children, I have never really had the feeling of being happy. In general, almost nothing good has ever happened to me. 

Conclusion: So now I wonder does it even make sense for me to exist? 

I am insolvent I have a divorce behind me. My partner will leave me soon. I have no job anymore. No friends . And probably soon no more apartment (since I then the insolvent also no new apartment more find). 

EDIT: 

First of all, thank you all! 

You have really touched my heart, even if it is hard for me to admit something like that. 

You don't have to worry about me doing anything to myself! 

I don't want my children to have a horrible childhood like me! 

Besides, for your love! You are really great and I understood that there are things in life worth living for! 
Of course, I will also seek professional help. 
It is not very easy to get appointments here but I will keep at it and not give up! 
I know I can't change my past but I can change my future!

My inbox has exploded with messages and I have already replied to some. Even if I wanted to, I probably won't manage to reply to every single one.

Thanks again you are great!

AND STOP PLS GIVING ME REWARD SAVE YOUR MONEY ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è","Hey there fellow internet person. 

I just want to say that from an outsiders perspective I have a few notes for you. 

1. Narcissists tend to believe that therapy isn't working for them, but I think there's still a benefit there if you're able to do it for free/cheaply. Be candid and brutally honest with your therapist and even if you feel as though they aren't helping you, the candor and the honesty could trigger your own self-help. But above all, go back to your therapist and just be overtly honest. The worst thing that can come from that is that it doesn't help. 

2. You say that you don't have friends but then you also mention online friends and old colleagues. Start there. Foster your online friendships, because those are absolutely real. And reach out to an old colleague or two and maybe do the following: A) be respectful and genuine in asking how they're doing, B) let them know how you're doing, and be honest. 

3. You say that your current relationship is doomed, but so long as you're still together there's still time to fix it. I'd recommend telling your partner that you are feeling unwell and that you need help. It's an incredibly vulnerable situation to place yourself in, and it's also not easy. Maybe take a few days and try to map out how you want to have this conversation with her. And when you figure that out, then go to her and be as open and honest as you can. If she's smart she can smell manipulation and lies so just tell her what you've laid out here on this forum. You're not feeling well and you've got a lot of issues you want to overcome and you feel as though you're down a peg in every facet of life... and you want to change. Change is the key here. If she is a good partner she will know something is off and she will know that change is necessary. You need to be open to change.

4. I don't know how jobs work in DE but I'm also in a shitty work situation out here in America at the moment. It's going to take time, perseverance, and possibly help from others to get your ship righted so they say. Be open to something that's below your pay grade. Be open to something that's new. That's my only words of advice there but take them with a grain of salt since I'm not exactly a renowned expert here. 

5. Housing. I don't know how the German government deals with insolvency and housing but surely you won't become homeless and living on the streets? You have family, albeit a poor one, you can always start there. You also have colleagues who might be able to help you find a job which would help with being able to pay for housing. Try to ask there, too. 

6. I think you can find drive in the following: knowing that your children are looking up to you to set an example, and knowing that you still have the opportunity to make your life much better than what it is and what it has been - it's exciting when we as humans have the chance to do better!

I wish you well, stranger. I hope you get the therapy you need. I hope you fix your relationships. I hope you find consistent work. And I hope you see that your life is definitely one that can still get much, much better with a little push from yourself. 

You got this.",1673,96,2/7/2021 14:11,len5sx

depression,Do you guys ever have intrusive thoughts about what a horrible person you are over past mistakes that nobody even remembers or cares about?,"Since this pandemic began, I've been experiencing a lot of guilt and remorse over very trivial, cringy stuff I did when I was a kid.

This has begun to affect my concentration and I've been losing sleep.

I was just wondering if anybody else is experiencing this? Is this a symptom of depression? Is it my low self-worth? I don't know why I feel this way. Does anyone have advice?

Thank you in advance. I'd be appreciative of any advice I can get ;-;

Edit: Guys, ty, ty, thank you for the support ;-; ‚ù§Ô∏è!! I just want to quickly say that reading the comments made me feel less alone in my struggle. It breaks my heart knowing others are going through the same thing. I took you guys' advice and spoke to someone I can trust about my stupid past actions and well, they thought I was worrying over nothing. This really made me feel relieved as I thought they'd be ashamed of me or something. It's crazy what your mind can convince you of. That being said, starting tomorrow I'll be working on my sleep schedule and treating myself better. If that fails, I will seek therapy. Good night guys, I can't thank you enough and I wish you all the best. I appreciate you all so much you lovely human beings

Edit: I'm so glad to hear that some of you are also reading the comments on here and feel a sense of relief that this is more common than you thought, honestly I had no idea either! There's some great advice on here guys and I'll make sure to read back on it if I ever start to doubt myself again. I've also saved some of your posts on my phone just as a reminder that I shouldn't be so hard on myself.","Its like a mixture of regrets and yearning to return to the past.

depression,My parents told me to kill myself,"My anxiety ate me alive this morning I felt awful and fought with my parents about it. They told me to kill myself so after panicking I took my jacket and left my home. I went to the nearest bridge and sat there with my legs out of the bridge, over the water.

I dunno, maybe that'd be weird or something. Seems like a powerful gesture though, takes a kind heart imo.

Hope you are all doing well or if not that things get better for you <3

I know this post will be ignored but at least I tried. At least I tried to get help from my parents, friends, school, hotlines, reddit but nobody wants to help. The only person I had left was my bf but yesterday he just said he feels like all he is is a therapist to me. It really broke my heart into a million pieces. Because I dont have anybody else to talk to and he always said it was okay for me to vent to him. 

My parents called me a freak and a weirdo, said that I need to snap out of this and get over myself, after they saw my stupid blog about my depression when I was 13 (idk why I made that - 13 yr old me was questionable) they got enraged. When they saw my self harm at 14 they got really mad. The tension in the house and the shame was unbearable, I couldnt look at them in the eyes and spent most of my time hiding in my room. Now I act like I'm fine and happy all the time, we talk about other stuff and joke and laugh together, and its massively improved our relationship. I'm grateful to have parents I now get along with. But it's only because I hide my mental health. Lately things have gotten so bad, its getting hard for me to hide it from them. I'm forgetting to do things they told me to, I'm losing things they lent to me, they're getting pissed off when I didnt mean to. I'm not doing this on purpose. Got mad because I didnt phone my grandma to thank her for some money. Of course it came across as rude and I felt so guilty. My whole family probably thinks I dont care about them. I feel like shit but they dont want to know the truth.

My friends - they all have it bad. Bad home lives, mental health problems, every single one of them, and I'm always trying to help them. But when I tried to open up they treated it like a competion and didnt even ask what was up with me just said they had it worse. I havent spoken to them in weeks because I'm so depressed and nobody even checks up on me to see how I am. It's hard to pretend im happy and smiling and laughing so I dont talk to them. I'm not okay but they're not in the right place to help me they need help themselves.

It's getting really hard to socialise. I talk to my boyfriend everyday and it's just so so so hard to talk and do normal things with him, I try to cover up how bad I'm hurting but sometimes I crack, he said it was okay for me to vent anytime but it looks like I did it too much and he says he feels like a therapy buddy. I feel so fucking shit that I cant even get my shit together.

School is so difficult. I log onto my live lessons and sit there and listen to my tutor saying ""mental health matters guys!"" When their school counsellor wont even bother to show up. Time and time again the school counsellor has cancelled on me LAST MINUTE or during class when we cant use our phones, or just simply not been there. My mental health doesn't fucking matter to the school does it. They say ""its really important we look after our wellbeing"" so they suggest going out for a walk, breathing, taking breaths and ""talking to someone"", well we already know that's not fucking possible. But the other tips are just really basic level things, they don't bother to invest deeper into mental health and help people with genuine problems because they might not have superhero parents that can get them to the doctors or therapists, they only tell us how to ""look after our wellbeing"" when I'm doing all those things and it's gone beyond that. I'm REALLY doing badly. And they dont care. They just expect you to get on with it. So I get told off for not participating in my live lessons. Well I'm sorry that I tried to reach out for help because you said mental health matters and yet I got nothing so you now you expect me to act okay and surprise surprise I cant fucking do it. I cant switch off my mental health for you, school. There is no place in school for people like me when they expect you to be motivated, high achieving, focused, participating, just always okay, and I cant do it!!! And I know this will transfer into the real world, the working world, they always expect you to be okay. And it's not like I want to walk around looking all miserable, but it's just getting so hard to keep that happy mask on all the time.

I have a university interview coming up soon. I dont know if I can do it. I'm so broken and suicidal that I dont think I can act all enthusiastic and persuade them I'd be a great, passionate, hardworking student when I can barely do my schoolwork and struggle to even get out of bed, dress myself and eat.

Theres so many signs I'm struggling. And nobody cares. If you're lucky, they will say they do, they spit out the cliches, give you the useless suicide hotline number and move on with their lives. In most circumstances you have to shut up and act like you're okay your whole life. There is no place in the world for people like me.",I read your entire post.

depression,I feel so guilty for having depression when I‚Äôve not really had anything traumatic happen to me and there‚Äôs so much evil going on in the world,I don‚Äôt deserve this life,"I've got truma and have had a lot of bad experiences which have lead up to my issues. But your depression is just as valid as mine or anyone elses. We're all in the same boat. 

I think it's hard enough just existing sometimes, don't beat your self up for struggling. You're human and your experience is valid. There's always going to be evil in the world sadly, but try not to tie that to you.

I use to hate myself for being depressed when there's people in worse situations than me, but that is the case for everyone, there is always someone off worse and someone doing better. Try to focus on yourself, you're already struggling and you don't need the weight of the world on your shoulders. You do deserve life, I hear you.

depression,My therapist cried in a session and another therapist told me to quit her ASAP,"I have been seeing my therapist for a few years but just started recently feeling comfortable enough to open up about my past trauma to her. Upon doing so, she cried. She did try to hold it back but eventually she cried then immediately apologized and told me that I remind her of her daughter and she cares about me. It honestly was the first time I've felt love from a parental figure.  

However, during that time I was actually having a mental breakdown. I was reliving my trauma everyday and it impacted my work greatly. My boss was not understanding and my physichiatrist eventually recommended a extensive therapy group with a ""great therapist.""

This therapist was not at all what I expected. She was incredibly into the ""tough love"" approach. She made everyone go in a circle and talk about their most traumatic moments. I have social anxiety and these were strangers so I did not really participate in that. But I did talk about my therapy experience and my coping mechanisms and such. She eventually found out that my therapist cried once in a session. She told me that was ""beyond unprofessional"" and that I should ""drop her immediately."" 

I actually did end up dropping her only to get a horrible experience with another therapist. One recommended by the therapist that told me to drop my initial therapist. 

I was so sad and eventually went back to my initial therapist. I haven't seen anything wrong but I can't get help but feel insecure about my own decision. Am I making the right choice? Is it okay to go to someone cause they feel like a friend you can open up to? Are emotions bad and unprofessional for a therapist to express?

*LIL' UPDATE*

Wow! Thank you all so much for the comments and awards. It was so nice to read all of your experiences, I'm so overwhelmed with happiness rn to not feel so alone!   

I have seen 8 therapists in my life and I have never felt this comfortable with one. It honestly was the first time I haven't regretted telling a professional my personal trauma. Although not everyone agrees with this approach, her emotion ultimately showed me that I have people that care about me and it really helped me in a time when I really just needed compassion.

With that being said, I am continuing to see my empathetic therapist as that is what works best for me. 

Thank you again for all of your reassurance and encouragement in helping me choose what's best for me. I struggle a lot with decision making so I was really in my head about this. Anywho, just wanted to say you are part of a wonderful community here and I hope you all find happiness/peace. I'm not there quite yet, but baby steps are okay.","No, your therapist was simply being human and has empathy and that‚Äôs why she cried.

depression,My life in a nutshell;,"Having anxiety and depression is like being scared and tired at the same time. 
It's the fear of failure but no urge or will to be productive.
It's wanting friends but hate socializing.
It's wanting to be alone but not wanting to be lonely.
It's caring about everything just to abruptly care about nothing.
It's the feeling of feeling everything at once then feeling paralysingly numb.
It's wanting to get help, but subconsciously knowing it won't make a difference because you can't see the light at the end of the tunnel, you are just tired of being in the tunnel.",And you cannot tell this to anyone because they'd think that you are making excuses.

depression,"Bought a gun with my stimulus for suicide, posting some ramblings here because I feel alone. It's long and I apologise for the length","Don't know where to start. But currently I'm in airbnbs using what little savings I have, trying not to think about commiting suicide. I used my stimulus check to purchase a firearm just for the peace of mind of knowing I could do it whenever I was ready, and when I realized how calm that made me, I decided to post here to see if anyone could give me some advice

I live in the desert in Arizona but I grew up in California. I've always felt alone and suicidal since a child. I was raised by my grandparents as far back as I can remember after my mother left to AZ after my half brother was born, years later my half sister was born there. After my grandparents passed when I was 16 I had to move to AZ. I've learned growing up, I was around dangerous settings, and car accidents in infancy and I'm worried that also might be a factor in why my brain is wired this way, on top of the regular stuff.

My grandparents were absolutely loving and seemed to try their best to put me in a better environment. I never told them these feelings because I wanted to be a ""perfect"" ""son"" for them in exchange for what they did for me. My grandpa was an old school cowboy type, traditional conservative..but never once told me I had to be any certain way.

As you can probably tell, polar opposite here in AZ.I have no relationship with my birth father or an idea of what he even looks like (yes no photos) anyways I was told by my parents that my father went to jail for murdering his girlfriend in CA (but he's been out for a few years already? Somehow?) and my mother and step father are convinced I'm a murderous sociopath that's going to kill them all one day randomly.

My step father choked me, and my mother and him pretty much told me to go because I make them feel uneasy. (stepfather kept a loaded gun on him in case he had to shoot me, leading to my airbnb situation) Most days at home I kept to myself in my room, but in October I went back to California for 2 weeks when my depression was hitting it's peak to see if I had hope or needed closure or something. I went back to my hometown and didn't feel any pain, I was happy for once, I was with my girlfriend who I wanted to take to prom back in CA before I had to move, and it feels like ever since I left, my life was in limbo. 

I want to go back to live with her but I need to find a job there as well as a cheap apartment, and it's extremely difficult. However she told me she's been wanting to leave home and get someplace for herself as well, it's honestly the only reason I haven't done it yet but deep down I feel like this won't work out. I have this sense of abandonment so I default to isolating myself and suffer because since childhood I've told myself over and over ""no one really cares about you"" and it still carries with me and still ruins so many of my relationships

But what's really making me finally want to go through with it, is that I did gig work, so I've been getting stimulus and the PUA, so basically money to just sit around doing nothing. I was living at home with my mother so I saved all the money. I have the title to my car (2012 nothing crazy) no debt, no student loans, and a 700 credit score. I was always the chubby kid but since covid I've lost weight (like 60 pounds) smoking weed and drinking water, I can get girls, I lost my virginity, and I'm still absolutely depressed and suicidal. I even put off losing weight for so long because I was so scared if I got in shape and hooked up with¬† women, & wasn't immediately happy. No Im actually feeling worse because now what? I know self care love is important and a good way to fight depression, but I lost that weight, paid off my car, reduced my debts, etc. The next goal would be to have my own home but that's just adding time to the clock like I did with my weight problem

All of this makes me terrified that what my mother and step father say is true and I should just isolate myself or die. I have NO family, when I was living with my grandparents until 16 no one ever came to visit or help, and at their funeral there was mostly friends from the neighborhood. I don't know aunties cousins uncles or any of that. That abandonment feeling was heightened because of this, because my grandparents, to me, my real parents, were abandoned by everyone when they were sick and dying. It reinforced the idea that this will happen to me too with any relationship/friendship I have. ""No one really cares"" 

I feel like no matter what life will not get better and I won't be happy, just on autopilot bouncing between feelings of absolute torment and apathy. I don't want to live for decades this way and I'd much rather die at peace. Not to mention how in my lifetime I'd be contributing so much pollution and waste to the world for an existence that isn't even appreciative of being alive. One other thing is holding me back is that I'm perfectly healthy and wish I could give all my organs away, I know they have to be on ice but I was planning on shooting myself deep in the mountains at sunset to let my body be given back to nature, but my kidneys could help save a child's life so it feels like a waste and insult 

I'm also very scared of dying and there being a hell and eternal punishment, I was never really religious but my grandma tried to raise me catholic and that fear is still always there. With age my thoughts of suicide went from ""I hate myself and want to die"" to ""I feel nothing and things would be easier for me and them if I was never born"". I don't keep ammo with me because now, I feel like that peaceful mountain death is the only thing keeping me going and as soon I get some ammo Im going on that drive","I'm realizing now how absurdly long this post is compared to the others I've read. I apologize and thank you so very much for anyone taking the time to read it. I hope to whoever is reading this, that you have an absolutely amazing day and an even better year.

depression,Seeing yourself getting worse and worse and not caring enough to do anything is the worst part of depression.,"For normal people with healthy brains (honestly do those even exist anymore?), whenever things in their life are going wrong, they do what they can to fix it and get better. For those of us who are depressed and do not have that luxury, we've lost interest in caring for ourselves.

There's no clear path on how to fix our lives and the chances of actually succeeding are minimal at best. The amount of effort required is too great and we find life and especially our own lives to be meaningless so why bother trying?

I've grown more apathetic towards life and I really can be bothered to care much about myself. I see my mental state getting worse and life passing me by, bit really I just don't care. I find myself unable to relate to others when they talk about their futures because I genuinely don't see one for myself and I'm not interested in trying to build one. Especially when I have no building materials and no way of obtaining them.

This has to be the worst part about being depressed. It's an illness that makes you not care enough to get help and better yourself leading to a slow decline with endless sadness and misery while your physical health worsens. If that isn't the scariest illness then I don't know what else is.","I really can relate to this as well, especially the other people talking about their futures part because it doesn‚Äôt matter and you can‚Äôt care when you feel this way.

depression,Called the suicide prevention hotline for the first time ever,"I actually felt suicidal today. Really and truly.

I haven‚Äôt told anyone I know and don‚Äôt think I will.

And the ones I do trust, well I don‚Äôt want to feel like a burden on them.

But, it helped so much. Honestly.

Maybe it‚Äôs kind of fake cuz it‚Äôs their job and they‚Äôre trained to be empathetic and understanding, but it felt SO GOOD to have someone to listen and care.

To give a fucking shit that I am dying inside and so goddamn overwhelmed with almost all the aspects of my life.

I cried so so much. I hid in the closet of my bedroom for some privacy and just poured my all my pain and worries out to the kind lady on the phone.

She comforted me and showed me kindness and concern and that felt so fucking good to just have someone listen.

She said she‚Äôll call in again to check in on me and that feels nice.

Please use the suicide prevention hotline. I was teetering on the edge.

Probably wasn‚Äôt going to go through with it, but I really genuinely wanted to be dead because life had just dealt me one too many blows and I couldn‚Äôt stand up anymore.

Thank you stranger. Now I‚Äôm gonna go binge movies and work.","I had an opposite experience. When I tried to call the hotline, I genuinely hoped they would help as I was in a horrible state and was not thinking clearly outside of sadness and the desire to end it.  
I called the hotline and the way they asked me questions made me feel like they were trying to invalidate why I called. They literally asked me why I felt the need to call the hotline if I only had the urge to kill myself and wasn‚Äôt actually going to do it.

depression,Knowing that suicide is always an option gives me a lot of comfort. Am I weird? How far down that depression rabbit hole am I?,"I don't have a lot to add. I'm depressed, I guess? This has been going on for decades. I don't know anymore. Am I really depressed anymore, or has it turned into something else? I hate being awake. I wake up every day in a state of shock, overcome with dread. I sleep as much as possible, but I have always had insomnia, so I only get a good night's sleep every 2-3 weeks. I snap awake as soon as I start falling asleep. I've tried medication, therapy, and jesus, but nothing has helped. I recently realized that living with my father is a huge source of stress and anxiety for me. He's emotionally and mentally abusive to me every day. I am moving out soon, which is great (I hope), but I am not expecting all my problems to magically disappear. Despite it all, I am working hard to get a good education and build a better life for myself. Why? I honestly don't know. Because it's expected of me, I guess? What do I want out of life? To be happy, of course! But we all know that ""happy"" isn't realistically achievable. Life is never perfect, so I guess I am aiming for something more modest, like contentment. To me, contentment would be a quiet simple life with very little stress. Not a lazy life, per se, but one where there is little or no pressure on me to do things I simply don't want, and don't need, to do. 

&#x200B;

At this point of my life, I have spent so much time in my head that I feel I've become unrelatable to regular folks.","I believe that people are comforted by the thought that they could commit suicide if they wanted because it gives them control over an aspect of their life that they believe is filled with many things they can't control. And it can be comforting knowing you control something in life even if that something is a terrible choice.

And it seems you are taking the right steps to keep giving yourself control over your own life and feelings. You see what may be hurting yourself and you are making the moves to escape them and help yourself. Honestly keep doing what your doing and keep fighting to try and better yourself and your life. You will get there as long as you fight and believe in yourself.",1471,47,7/11/2021 20:55,oicgmw

But for me, acknowledging that, and coming to terms with the fact that what I'm actually missing out on is what's right here and now was a long journey towards escape. I've not escaped, but I feel like I can at least see the glow of an exit sign now, where before it was darkness. It sucks that there's a pandemic on top of everything now too though. Any way.

depression,Can't start anything,"I'll pick up my bass guitar. Play a few notes. Put it down.

I'll think about what video game I want to play. Play a few minutes. Lose interest.

I'll watch Youtube videos for game development. Get overwhelmed. Quit.

I'll listen to music and get inspired to do something and then in a few minutes lose that inspiration.

I'll have hope for my future, think of a reason why it won't work out, and go back to being hopeless.

I'll reach out to someone on reddit and then realize what's the point of telling my life story all over again to some stranger and then go back to bottling up my despair.

This has been my life the past few days.","man, I did not except to come across something so relatable on accident.

depression,Depression makes me SO boring,Honestly I am so damn boring. Like.. its a main reason why I don't date anyone and never will. Its a reason why I have no friends and never will. Nothing really interests me so I don't have much to talk about. I suck at all conversations and once again I'm so boring. When i was a kid I had a personality I was funny and goofy and happy. Now I'm just a dead zombie that will laugh at things in public to not seem depressed. But my brain is so dead from depression I can't come up with any jokes or shit. The only thing I can do is listen and barely speak which I actually hate. I wanna be funny and have a personality and be desirable but I'm not that.

When the few things you had in life that you used to enjoy either become dull to you or impossible to motivate yourself to do.

When it starts to seem pointless to even try accomplishing anything because you know that no matter where you are in life you will probably still be depressed.

When you can no longer stand speaking to the people you love because it‚Äôs either pretend to be happy or ruin their whole mood/day and make them worried about you.

When even the most simple conversations are very hard to get through without being triggered by something and wanting to break down.

When it gets to the point where you have heavily considered abruptly cutting the people you love out of your life because interacting with them is becoming exhausting and you would rather them think you‚Äôre an asshole for isolating from them than to give them the even more painful truth about where your mind is going and what you think is inevitable.

When the overall feeling of not having anything in your life that makes you happy anymore starts to be far more painful in your mind than actually having negative things happen to you.

Edit: I was not expecting so many people to see and relate to this post but I guess these feelings are more common than any of us thought. As much as I hate that other people are going through the same thing, reading these replies did make me feel a little more understood and a little less alone so thank you all for that.","The doctors, therapist, and other health workers I see always ask why I don't feel able to talk to my family and friends about my issues. This post sums it up perfectly. That constant choice between talking about how you're feeling and making their emotional state worse, or pretending to feel okay and becoming utterly exhausted by it. Because talking about it won't do anything - it's not like their problems, that are stressful and unpleasant, but get resolved. It is constant, and seemingly unending, and so so much more than they can deal with (or is fair to put onto them). Because they ask how we are, and say that we can talk to them, but aren't really prepared when we truly talk about how we're feeling. It's such a lonely place to be.",1392,46,6/7/2021 14:13,nudjwk

depression,11yr old son came to me and said he had planned to shoot himself.,"Driving to soccer practice my son told me he had planned to sneak into my room and (somehow) unlock my safe and shoot himself. Then went on to say he no longer wanted to do it.  He cited rejection from kids at school as the main source of his sadness, but as his father I have a hard time not assigning blame to everything I can think of that I might have done differently. I have personally had suicidal ideation issues since about 12 but never gone as far as a plan to actualize those thoughts. Feeling as though I passed a torch but also telling myself that it is most likely other factors ( my therapist agrees with the latter). Any advice for helping a pubescent 11yr old, and not blaming myself for everything ?

Edit: update and more info. 
You guys this chat has been amazing! Thank you to everyone involved and that took time to post! Thought I would give more background to the situation that people have asked or talked about.

We learned he was having suicidal thoughts from his school. My wife is a fifth grade teacher and received a call from my sons school that he had texted another student and mentioned he was going to kill himself. The student told their parent the parent contacted the school.  My wife immediately left with her school counselor to pick him up and take him to her school. He wasn‚Äôt saying much and didn‚Äôt give any specifics to my wife about plans, just that what she was being told was true.
      That night is when he told me of his plan but that he didn‚Äôt want to do it anymore. My therapist said it would be a good idea to get the whole family involved for support, so we also had a family meeting with his two sisters letting them know what was happening. It went amazing and everybody had a good cry and let him know how much he meant to them and how much we would miss him. I also moved my gun safe out of the house to a family members.
   The next day my wife took him to school my with her and went to see the school counselor/licensed therapist. They talked about what was going on made a safety plan and talked about coping mechanisms for him.  He will be having sessions with her regularly. 
   We now have open communication with him about his anxiety/depression levels. His thoughts of suicide he says have been minimal. He did tell me during one talk ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to die, but my brain keeps telling me I do‚Äù. He‚Äôs an very emotionally sensitive and has always been. He takes things personally and rejection is amplified because of this. 
   I feel we have moved into a better space around the situation, and he is doing well. 
   Thanks again for all the responses, they have been validating and uplifting. You all are amazing and thank you for the support !","Well I am glad your kid decided to talk to you instead. The fact that he felt comfortable talking to you is a good sign. Stay strong my man, stay strong.",1374,53,12/23/2021 0:30,rmiync

depression,"I don't want to kill myself, I just don't want to exist","My life feels to be falling apart. I don't know how to explain it other than my limbs all being stretched and physically unraveling and dislodging. 

My brain is rot and my insides are rot. Rotted goop. 

I don't have a purpose in life, I have no dreams in life, I'm wasting away the prime of my life. I dive into my eating disorder to cope and get high sometimes and self-harm. 

Therapy for me of 3 years failed and my therapist took an indefinite leave so that went down the drain. My psychiatrist is cool but I've tried 15+ meds and nothing really works. 

I can't figure out this big issue in my life and I repeatedly obsess and ruminate over it with no answers or solutions as I sit paralyzed in fear. 

I think I just realized today that my depression has been getting worse in ways I didn't recognize as I've gone up on this new medication. Talking to people has become more of a chore than it used to be. It gets on my nerves to have to speak up or when anyone talks to me. I don't care to talk about anything I'm interested in anymore. I used to at least have some interest in certain topics, but now I just don't care and I don't want to talk to anyone. Every word said to me or that I say is a fork on a chalkboard. I have to psych myself up to raise my voice and speak. 

I don't care about doing things I used to do with friends. Well, I care less, anyway. Or more like I'm just indifferent. Numbed out... I still care. But it doesn't feel as...there? It feels like I'm wearing emotion-canceling headphones. It's all still there, but it's so muted. 

I can't stay awake during the day at work at all. Worse now than before. I find myself seeming to play less with my wonderful pets...

I've lost credibility at work and plateaued with my ability. And I just don't care anymore. It makes me feel bad but I don't care enough to do anything about it at all. I realize I suck at my work but so what. I've already failed, I still fail. So what... 

My motivation was already shit but now it's more like I don't care... I used to be upset that my motivation was gone, angry about it, in a sense? And now I kind of just don't give a shit. I recognize that my motivation is still gone and sure it's still upsetting but not as upsetting as it was because I don't feel the anger at myself as much. 

Occasionally I have bursts of extreme emotion, like yesterday I had a MAJOR anger rage moment where I had to take anti anxiety meds to even remotely start to calm down after a period of screaming, slamming things around and knocking things over and self-harming viciously in a frenzy. 

Some days I burst into tears for all night and just keep a rag with me to soak up the tears as the time passes and I try to do things that fall within my normal schedule and small range of activities I do once I go home from work. 

Every day is a repeat of the day before. Week by week. All the same. It's Monday, then suddenly Friday. Then the weekend. Then Monday...repeat. I don't care about any of it. Monday, Wednesday, Sunday...whatever. All the same. 

The best part of my day is when I get to come home from work and have a binge and purge episode for like 2-3 hours. That's literally the most I look forward to. And even that is starting to fade out. 

Everything is faded. Everything is muted. At random times I explode, but then the monotony sets back in and I find myself almost in a stupor of some kind. 

My life is meaningless and I want it to be over. I don't want to commit suicide, I just want to not exist.","I feel the same exact way. Tbh it makes me mad when people act like stuff has meaning lol. I know that‚Äôs the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù way to be but if I say I don‚Äôt care about anything, I don‚Äôt want to hear ‚ÄúYou just need to find a hobby! Oh you should try meditating!

depression,My mom died yesterday,"My mom died yesterday night at around 12 am. She killed herself. I can only assume she has schizophrenia. The previous 2 weeks of her death, she was acting totally different, nothing of herself. She was going on about God (she was never religious) and how if we don‚Äôt believe in him we are going to hell. It all began from when she was dating this guy Joseph, and when she came home that night she was totally different. 

I now live with just my dad and sister, and all to remind I am just 16. It really hurts she is dead. All I can think about it her death. I cry off and on and some moments I feel fine then others times I feel numb. 

My family is being supportive- but none of them understand this pain. They remind me ‚Äúit wasn‚Äôt her‚Äù I know it wasn‚Äôt her. My mom would have never done this to us. It doesn‚Äôt change the fact my mom is selfish for killing herself. 

I can still hear the gun shot in the bathroom. It hurts to even go into the bathroom to even touch any of her stuff. I mourn with happy pictures of her- still painful to think she would change so fast.

I looked through notebooks of hers, she used to write like it was her life. She wrote lists and lists of things to do, chore lists, grocery lists, activity lists‚Ä¶etc. it was never ending. 

My mom was always full of life, always ready to take on what life gave her. She never considered suicide. 

The night of when she killed herself she was preparing us all night. It hurt to hear her talk like that. She had cuts all over her body and bruises on her thighs from the 48 hours she disappeared. That morning she came home naked and wrapped up in blanket- apparently walking around the city. 

I want to let every one know that no matter what, cherish the people around you and take the sad things seriously. Never forget that that may be the last time you‚Äôll see them.",Oh my god. I‚Äôm so sorry.,1336,94,6/9/2021 2:39,nvl9fg

depression,I think acting depressed around people was a mistake,"No one gives a shit lmao. Unless you have a very special person who's very close to you, whoever notices you're acting off will not want to help, because you're not fun to be around, and in the end you'll just lose connections.

Truth is, you're way better off if you force a smile on your face. If I had known this before, I feel like I might have had more and better relations with people that I would have liked.

Don't get me wrong, I think its important for people to talk about their depression and be true to themselves. But it's just simply futile to mope around depressed around your peers since that's just gonna insure that no one's ever gonna talk to you, its a terrible alternative. So ""give in"" if you want to help yourself.

EDIT: okay, I was wrong. I really should not have gotten this many upvotes. I know no one is gonna see this since I'm editing after like a month, but I was wrong. 

Talking to people helps so, so much. Its just, you gotta find the right people, or you gotta build a friendship with someone to eventually be able to talk about your depression. Its true that forcing a smile on your face will probably help you to build these kind of friendships, and its true its not a good idea express your depression to randoms just like that.

 But I just want to say, don't bottle up your feelings forever. Do what you must to create friendships with people that enable you to do this. Often forcing a smile helps for this. But dont do this forever.","Sometimes I feel that is unfair to put pressure on my friends by asking them to listen over and over to my irrational believes. We need to talk though.

I don't want to die now, but God, I can't help but think how much better things would have been if I was successful 6 years ago.  My son wouldn't have to grow up in a broken home.  I wouldn't be crying every single day.  I wouldn't be trying to finish school when I can barely function.  My body wouldn't feel like it was shutting down.  There would be none of this suffering.  I guess what I'm saying is this living thing was only worth it because I got a child out of it.  I got to know the real love for my baby, and now I'll never ever kill myself because I have him and he will need me forever.  Which coincidentally means I have to suffer forever until I die naturally.  :( Sorry, just in my feelings today.  I want to celebrate my 6 more years of life, but I just can't.  There's nothing to celebrate about living a life like mine.  Maybe I don't think positively enough.

depression,I feel like I‚Äôm getting ‚Äúdumber‚Äù ?,"So I‚Äôve been depressed for years. I‚Äôd consider myself a relatively smart guy, but recently I‚Äôve noticed pretty heavy  brain fog, frequent headaches, and just my overall ability to think and process information impaired. I‚Äôm still able to memorize notes, and stay focused in class for the most part but I do notice a difference and my only guess is that years of depression and anxiety has finally caught up to me (cognitively)? I honestly had no idea that depression effected your critical thinking skills until recently. I don‚Äôt drink or do drugs, I‚Äôm pretty active, and I eat relatively clean. I don‚Äôt take any medication, although I have a bottle of SSRIS still sitting in my cabinet prescribed to me months ago. I‚Äôve always tried fighting through this mentally, but should I take them? Would it alleviate my current cognitive disfunction? I‚Äôd really appreciate some help because I‚Äôm kinda worried, thanks everyone üôÉ","i've had the exact same problem, i've lived with these illnesses for years but it seems like my brain only recently caught up to the thinking processes. I used to have an amazing memory but now I can barely remember something I just read. nowadays i feel like i just kind of stare at stuff and i SEE them but i don't process it or attach emotion to it?

depression,Looking for a job while depressed is honestly hell,"My self esteem is so low and my anxiety is at the highest level it‚Äôs ever been. I‚Äôve been out of work about a month now.

depression,Gaming won‚Äôt distract me forever,"Lately I‚Äôm gaming 6-10 hours out of the day just to distract myself from feeling empty. I guess it‚Äôs better than wallowing in my depression, but the minute I stop I‚Äôm back to suicide ideation. I get it can‚Äôt fix my problems, but the anxiety of stopping and letting myself feel is too much. It‚Äôs getting bad again. Really bad. And I can‚Äôt really talk to anybody in my life about it. I‚Äôm not eating, I‚Äôm not sleeping, I‚Äôm just exisiting at this point and not really living. I just think if I pull myself away from the screen I‚Äôll give into the temptations that keep haunting me.

EDIT: Wow I honestly didn‚Äôt expect this to blow up. Thank you everyone for your kindness, I appreciate it so much. The amount of support through your comments and messages is incredible, thank you so much. I should‚Äôve mentioned I do have a job, it‚Äôs a casual job but it pays the bills. And I also do have a therapist, who is also great but I at times feel like I shelter him from a lot of what‚Äôs been going on. I have friends and family I could talk to, but with my history of mental health it would just burden them more than it already has. I will try reply to everyone‚Äôs comments and messages.","I don't really get enjoyment out of it, but it keeps my mind off things because I have to focus.

depression,Abusive parents don't realize that depression drains all your energy.,"Dad wants me to go get a haircut, mom wants me to take a shower.

I've opened up to them on this topic before (multiple times), it was always met with ""go do exercise and fix your body"", and one time, threats of being kicked out.","Ive never opened up to them before but they should notice as parents, im pretty ambitious and active but i get depressive episodes where i dont take care of myself and clutter my room with food, clothes and trash, and my parents just think im lazy.

I call you smart all the time"" my brother is SEVEN and he said ""everyone calls me smart but they are lying , all i know how to do is play games. Im dumb"" HES FUCKING SEVEN. HES FUCKING SEVEN YEARS OLD AND HES FUCKING (*SHOWING SIGNS OF*) DEPRESSION ALREADY. My parents are neglectful and they did me the same way , the first time I knew I hated myself was around 9. How did they fuck up again. Fucking how.

Edit : sorry for ""diagnosing"" him with depression. Im obviously not qualified to do so , I made this post in tears after listening to him because he has the exact same mentality as I did and still do, and I am extremely depressed myself so I was pretty much hysterical.

Edit 2: I didnt expect this to garner so much attention , thank you to everyone who also understands what im talking about and shared advice or their personal experience. Im debating on deleting it because people are trying to patronize me and minimize my abuse. Im used to it but it gets annoying.

Edit 3 : I wanna say this tho. My father works hard and he tries but hes an enabler. My mother is neglectful and abusive and he doesnt do anything about it. I do think if my father broke off from my mom he could raise my brother and I've been begging for him to do so because I plan on killing myself.","That‚Äôs really sad. My little brother (10) is the same, my mom berates him all the time. And it doesn‚Äôt help that he‚Äôs autistic, so he really doesn‚Äôt understand emotions or cues that well. He asked me ‚ÄúWhy do I always mess up?‚Äù And I just cried because I know that feeling. 

The only thing we can do as older siblings is love and support our kiddos. When we see them, shower them with praise, hugs and kisses. Let them know that they‚Äôre our world and how important they are. Tell him how handsome he is and how smart he is. Unfortunately it falls upon us (the failed ones) to instill confidence and worthiness into our younger siblings.

depression,My parents thought I died in my room and were prepared to bust down my door,"One day, when my parents went away for the weekend and I drilled two deadbolt locks to my room.

Why? I have no privacy in this house. When my brother was angry at me that same vacation, he kicked down my door and threw a pail of kitchen garbage all over my room. The ""lock"" on my door is easy to unlock, apparently my parents are able to open it easily and have been snooping into my room when I'm not there.

The day before yesterday, I had eaten more portions than normal and my dad yelled at me me; knocking over dishes and screaming that I ate so much. I locked myself in my room and didn't eat anything the whole day after that.

Today I wake up to my parents yelling my name and telling me to respond back. I see them somehow unlocking the door in their usual way; but the two deadbolts were there. That probably was a surprise to them.

I didn't want to get the police involved or buy myself a new door, so I opened the door and yelled at them for 10 seconds before closing the door. There were so many things left unsaid, I wanted to yell at them for more reasons.

They only care if I'm physically dead, not dead inside.",Wow.  Horrible parents. I'm so sorry :(,1290,30,4/22/2021 12:50,mw40n5

I remember being sad when I 12 and thinking it was normal. 10 years later, nothing has really changed. I can recognize now how much I mean to some people now, which makes it even harder. It makes me wish I killed myself when I was more naive and selfish. I love the people surrounding me and they support me but I can't seem to be happy. I can't help but feel like everything that goes wrong around me is my fault and that there is no way to fix it. If anyone reads this, thank you for taking the time.

depression,I feel like I have to at least try to kill myself before anyone takes me seriously. (17f),"This is long and I feel like I‚Äôm attention seeking for even writing this, but it‚Äôs how I feel. I could never actually do anything, but I‚Äôm tired and don‚Äôt know what else to do.

Everyone in my life seems to think that just because they don‚Äôt see me crying 24/7, I‚Äôm not depressed. But when I do end up opening up and crying, they take it personally and blame themselves or me and make me feel so ungrateful that I feel horrible for even trying to express anything. In result, I usually try and suppress my emotions to keep from bothering anyone and especially prevent making my mom feel bad as she tries her best. 

Thankfully, somedays I‚Äôm numb and can‚Äôt feel anything at all. 

My mom who I love dearly, feels that because I don‚Äôt pay any bills and don‚Äôt go to work, there‚Äôs absolutely no reason why I should be depressed. Which makes sense I guess, but my brain apparently doesn‚Äôt agree lol. 

I zone out as an escape sometimes and end up in deeper trouble. I‚Äôm weeks behind on my schoolwork and have teachers calling me everyday, being patronizing and snippy about the missing work and I hate myself for it. I‚Äôm occupying valuable space in their class, and for what? I feel like I‚Äôll never get caught up. I just want to be dead or at least in the hospital or something so that they‚Äôll leave me alone, a thought that I‚Äôll most likely never act on. Every time I look at my work, I get incredibly nervous and can‚Äôt think of anything else but failing and how angry they probably are with me. 

My mom is disappointed in me and no matter what I do or say, she doesn‚Äôt believe me and I end up giving up in the end because I feel like nothing. I look like a terrible student which is so different from my previous school years. I feel like I try so hard, but there‚Äôs no evidence to support it. I really wish I could do more, but I can‚Äôt, I try to force myself, but I can‚Äôt get much done and I don‚Äôt know why. I‚Äôm a terrible student, dumb, useless, and can‚Äôt complete work on time. I‚Äôve had no motivation for my work or anything else (like washing my hair or getting out of bed) completely disgusting, I know. 

I also have no friends. Normally, people exaggerate and say they have ‚Äúno friends,‚Äù but at least have one or two. I have none. No one to talk to or confide in. I‚Äôve never fit in anywhere and have social anxiety. No one cares. No one‚Äôs ever cared.

I struggle completely alone and have for seven years. I‚Äôve lost interest in everything I used to love, and it hurts so much. I think about killing myself almost everyday, but I‚Äôm a coward and would never do it. 

I‚Äôve asked in the past about seeing a therapist (covid makes the process even harder), but felt so horrible even asking because my mom said ‚Äòfine, but she‚Äôd have to pick up extra shifts to afford it‚Äô and that she didn‚Äôt understand why I couldn‚Äôt just talk to her because we‚Äôre close instead of being ungrateful and wanting to rely on a stranger and meds to make me stable like someone with real issues. 

I know she was just frustrated, but it‚Äôs statements like those that make me wish depression was more common and visible like the flu or something, so that I wouldn‚Äôt have to explain or feel weird or bad about getting treatment. 

It won‚Äôt be until I finally do something actually harmful, physical, and visible (my current ‚Äúself harm‚Äù which I don‚Äôt do often, isn‚Äôt) that I might get help. If I can even be helped. But I won‚Äôt and probably never will. 

I feel like nothing and a huge burden at the same time. A complete failure. And although I try to be as selfless as I can, I appear and feel like a selfish, ungrateful brat. I don‚Äôt have a bad life and my parents are great so why do I feel this way? There have been days where it felt like it could possibly get better, but I kid myself every time. Each year it somehow gets worst. I don‚Äôt really want to die, but hate my entire existence and want to get away. 

Also, I know this probably seems trivial and somewhat whiny. I‚Äôm sorry for bothering you all. I didn‚Äôt know where else to put this and it felt somewhat soothing to vent. Thank you if you decided to read this.


Edit: I‚Äôm typically a very private person so it took a lot to share this. Thank you all for being kind and giving me advice, I‚Äôm eternally grateful. I feel less alone now. It felt really nice to finally vent, I‚Äôm staying strong and am not going to let depression win.

I said no. I‚Äôm in the middle of finals. I know a couple places means ‚Äú5 places that I‚Äôll spend an hour each in‚Äù. 

I said no and he said alright. I thought that was the end of it. I get back in bed. An hour later he‚Äôs slamming shit in the kitchen, slamming doors closed downstairs, till finally, he comes up to me again, pounding on the door, asking me to take him somewhere.

Over the word no.

He eventually said nevermind and a second later he‚Äôs walking out the door slamming the door on his way out.

Edit: thank you for all the solidarity.

I struggle with this and the friends I have don‚Äôt always fully understand where I‚Äôm coming from all of the time so it‚Äôs nice seeing that I‚Äôm not insane over denying someone else.

depression,"Ever wonder what kind of person you would have become without your depression, anxiety or trauma?","*edit: wondered

I often think about this and I hate myself for the way I am because it limits me from being able to do so many things in life and live up to my fullest potential. It‚Äôs especially hard when you see your friends and peers excelling in life, getting good jobs and forming great relationships. 

I have rejected many good jobs because it gives me social anxiety.

I'm just a nobody, a burden who doesn't deserve anything!

I'm not even sure why I'm writing this, probably because I've isolated myself completely and I guess, subconsciously I might appeal to this as a last attempt at admitting I desperately need help, I'm ignoring loved ones, messages from friends, everyone and I don't even understand why.

depression,I'm almost 28 and i have wasted my life,"In a few months i will 28 and i have wasted my life. I have never had a job, a girlfriend, or a close friend. I graduated high school in 2012 and since then i have isolated myself rarely leaving my house. I'm posting this hoping someone will listen and maybe give advice.

I was raised by my grandparents and growing up they were controlling and overprotective. I did not get to do things most other kids were doing. I just stayed home all the time and played video games or watched tv. When i was in school i had no friends and rarely talked. I was not bullied but most of my classmates would not talk to me.  My teachers said i had a learning disability so thought out school i had extra help with my classes.. My grandfather died in 2007, After high school i isolated myself.  I have had opportunities to get jobs but i was scared to talk to strangers. The time has passed by so fast and i  cant believe i let this happened.

I Feel like there is no hope for things to change. Who would hire someone like me. I made bad grades in school and too poor to go to a community college.  I also would like a girlfriend but I'm short and too shy.  I'm very depressed and thinking about ending my life.

Edit. I never thought my post would get this much attention. I watched a youtube about suicidal thoughts and the guy said reddit helped him so i thought i would give this a try.I thank you all for the comments","I feel you. It‚Äôs okay to feel this way. Growth is hard...sometimes it‚Äôs easier just to numb out, especially when life hasn‚Äôt given you any reason to branch out (other than the slim possibility of a positive outcome). Also, having a family that understands you can make all the difference, and it sounds like yours did not. Based off what you shared, I imagine that your grandparents would‚Äôve been very conventional. 

I was a lot like you in high school, except I was lucky enough to have parents who made me get a job when I was 17. I was horrible at it and terrified of the customers. Management didn‚Äôt understand the anxiety I was dealing with and neither did my coworkers, so it was not a friendly environment. Customers thought there was something wrong with me and were generally pretty rude too.

It actually ended up being okay though. I somehow became a pretty good worker despite all my challenges and eventually even my coworkers grew to become friends with me.

depression,Mom said I‚Äôm free to commit suic*de if I finished my study.,"I‚Äôve been suffering from depression for more than 15 years and recently for many reasons it gets worse. In the year of 2017 my parents asked me to get a masters degree since my previous education was too bad, I successfully got enrolled but due to my mental health condition and my social phobia I feel it‚Äôs really hard for me to keep going, especially when I compare myself to other rich and happy schoolmates, I feel no motivation and no willing to focus on my study, I like it but it‚Äôs all because of my family wanted it, not me. I then realized that I haven‚Äôt done anything for my own good, I just fulfill other people‚Äôs wish all the time, this realization makes me frustrated and feeling hopeless and meaningless. So I‚Äôm being suicidal for some months. I talked to my mom last month, I said if I could quit, because I want to restart my own life and try to enjoy. I know I mess up my 31 year long life already since I don‚Äôt have a goal I am just being alive as my parents‚Äô best obedient kid, I see no future, no meaning in my life so I want to give up, I feel so excited when thinking about death, a relief and a method to solve all the pains. 
I talked about these feelings with my mom and dad I hope they can be understanding and supportive but they said no, I can‚Äôt quit before I finish my school, also they said if I want to die, it‚Äôs better to finish my school first then I can die with a certificate, that at least makes them feel good that I did a thing.  

I really want to die as a revenge to them, they don‚Äôt care about me and my problem, they said if I die it‚Äôll be a huge loss and shame for them, because their peers would really look down to them. But now they seem to know that my depression isn‚Äôt a made up excuse so they tried to negotiate with me, they literally said that I can kill myself if I could at least get the certificate, I really let them down all the time they said if I could try at least once?

I have no friends no relationship no one I could talk to with my problems but I don‚Äôt think anything will help me out. I‚Äôm just super suicidal I cry all day, I want to end everything but I hate my mom‚Äôs sad face and crying.","Holy fucking shit, you need to get away from your mother, I am so, so sorry for you. She probably is the cause of your depression, and you need to get away in any way as soon as you can.

That's something no parent should tell their kid, ever. Especially when they make themselves vulnerable by talking about such a topic. You are NOT doing this for them at all, if they have to make you succeed to make themselves feel praised, she's a total piece of shit in the first place. If she thinks she should drive you into this horrible mess just to feel good about herself. I you deserve better and deserve to be helped by a professional. I had lots of will to live a while ago, and it went away and I felt unmotivated to do anything and felt like a failure every second, every day. Trust me, it will get better and it is normal and expected that you now have no will to do anything or to live. But you shouldn't succumb to it. It's incredibly hard, but please search for help. Primarily the suicide hotline at this point. Anywhere online is okay too. Any help or hope or feeling that there may be something will aid in healing from this horrible godawful disease. Don't expect yourself to be convinced right away, it WILL feel like something you don't want to do and that is normal. Please don't give up. I probably can not talk will into your life, but suicide is not worth it, please believe me. You deserve love ‚ù£",1162,66,9/20/2021 7:51,prq5jq

One of the main things keeping me going is trying to help kind of look after his wife. Can't do much because of covid but I can at least check in with her every now and then, let her know she's not alone since after the funeral a lot of times you never hear from some people again.

depression,my pain (25F) is overwhelming: i've been quarantining in an abusive household for the last year and am in need of some kind words,"i've been struggling a lot this week. my mental health has always been shit but lately, it's just gotten worse. i recently fired my therapist because my insurance changed and she wasn't accepting the new provider (she wasn't a good fit for me either, but something is better than nothing). so aside from my boyfriend and a few friends, i don't have anyone i can rely on. i feel bad venting to the people around me because they're all going through tough times too and it just doesn't feel fair for me to unload on them. so i hope that opening up to this sub is the right idea, even though i still feel guilty expressing my pain.

the heart of it all is that i have C-PTSD (along with other psych disorders) and these past few weeks I've been drifting in and out of disassociation, flashbacks, and episodes of crying fits. i can't stop reliving my trauma and am having a tough time with positive self-talk. right now i'd say my self-worth and self-esteem are at a 0. it doesn't help that i live in an abusive household but unfortunately i don't have anywhere else to go, and this is something I've dealt with my whole life. my mother is neglectful and my father is emotionally, verbally, and sometimes physically abusive. he picked a fight with me this morning for no reason and it set me over the edge. so between the flashbacks, disassociation, and deeply painful depression, i just feel so unsafe in my house. if my parents see me crying, they'll either gaslight or bully me. i just wish things were different. i don't really know where i'm going with this post other than it would be nice to be reminded that not everyone is mean and nasty. that i am a good person and i deserve a good life. i just want to stop crying.

I have very little loved ones, and I cant express enough how little I give a shit about how sad they're gonna be when I kill myself. There is no way they will feel as terrible as I do everyday, at least have the ability to get over it whereas I am condemned to this suffering until I die some other way. I think about how my girlfriend will feel if she finds out I've killed myself and I just do not care, I love more than anything, even more than myself, but I want death so badly that there is nothing that convince not to do it now. My mum, dad, brother, grandad, grandma and literally everybody in my family will be devastated beyond words, and I am fine with that.

I wish all my problems could just be fixed by some miracle solution, and they all say it's just hard work that will fix it. 

But no pal, it's suicide and it's a legitimate solution. It ends my problems and that's all I want. I'm quite frankly sur people arent just okay with people suicide, and that it doesnt happen even more than it does. It's just such an absolute and perfect solution for everything, the only reason people stop is because they feel obligated to others, but I just dont have that filter. I feel oddly free in the solace that suicide gives me, whenever a new problem arises it doesnt affect me anymore because I know that one day I wont have to deal with this shit because I'll be dead and buried.","hi i'm not good at helping and i can't give you a good reason to live, but i hope things get better and if anything i'm a person who saw this <3",1127,62,2/2/2021 16:25,lazmim

depression,The cancer has spread to my liver,"Well it's most likely the cancer, anyways. The doctors like to make me feel better by saying there's a chance it'll be benign, but so far it never has been. Every test has come back as bad news, which just leads to more tests and more uncertainty. The pain in my hips has come back, and knowing I have a fresh mass in my liver that's already 5cm across....it freaks me out. It wasn't there when I had surgery in the beginning of may, which means it's spreading, and fast. I was feeling ok for a couple weeks, but the pain is coming back and I'm scared for the abdominal pain to come back...that was the worst. The hurt in my hip is like a constant dull ache that's always bothering me, but the pain in my abdomen was like always feeling like puking but never actually puking, along with stabbing pain if I moved wrong. I don't want that again. I even talked to my doctor about going back to work and she said go for it if I feel okay, but what if I don't actually feel okay? What if it just keeps getting worse? Will I ever be back to normal? Will I be able to go back to school in the fall? Will I be able to finish my degree or will the cancer completely derail the one goal I had finally started to crawl towards? I have a biopsy scheduled in 2 weeks and I'm scared for that; my first biopsy didn't give conclusive results that lead to 4 months of waiting for surgery bc no one thought it was serious. Im terrified of that happening again.

Im just so full of uncertainty and I'm scared and I feel like im not valid for feeling any of it. People have it worse than I do, so my brain tells me I don't get to be upset. But I am. But I don't want to be. I'm conflicted. I'm upset. I want to sleep so I don't have to feel.

Forgive the rant, but thank you if you read through my woes anyways.

Edit: I posted this without much thought last night in the middle of a break down and went right to sleep afterwards. I can't believe the amount of support people have shown me...im in shock.

depression,Is it worth waiting to see if your life eventually ever gets better?,"I‚Äôm about to turn 25 and I don‚Äôt even want it this year. The disingenuous attention is going to bum me out.

Long story short, I lost my job and then got stuck at my parents house. My dad is very narcissistic and toxic and is often damaging to my mental health.

I spent this past year developing myself more, learning more into my career, reading books, becoming spiritual, and finding a cause to do good in the world. I figured all of this is pointless I might as well spend it doing at least one thing that‚Äôs bigger than me and then I can die happy. I don‚Äôt need to be famous I just wish I can move the needle positively in society or in a community in some way. 

I don‚Äôt know what that is yet but I‚Äôm learning a lot of marketing and I consider myself a creative and passionate individual. I am a musician also. I also volunteer and am involved but it‚Äôs all remote. 

Right now I don‚Äôt have a real job, I have no friends, and now my band is falling apart. Last year, no one showed up to my birthday gathering, which is kind of what caused me to start this journey. I can start a new band by myself, and I can move out and find new friends that aren‚Äôt toxic and like me and respect me, maybe even find a girlfriend. I used to have at least a couple of those things at different points in my life. I‚Äôve been through 12 salary paying job interviews these past 2 months and none of them bite.

Now I have NOTHING. And I spent a year on myself for NOTHING. I have friends family and my therapist keep telling me ‚Äújust wait, your time will come‚Äù and other similar pointless advice that gives you nothing tangible to work with and instead is just ‚Äúyour life sucks, you can‚Äôt do anything about it, just wait and see if it gets better‚Äù

Well what if it doesn‚Äôt? What if I get hit by a car tomorrow? God, I really hope I do. I mean, I‚Äôm thankful that I‚Äôm healthy and alive under a house but I still pay exorbitant bills and it‚Äôs really not easy even with a garbage freelance job

I don‚Äôt want to live through this bullshit anymore. It‚Äôs been a year. I want my reparations back for all the people who lied to me for all this time. 

Am I being a freak or what? Why can‚Äôt I just catch a fucking break?

Edit: you guys are really sweet and this made my day, thank you",It always ebbs and flows. I turn 35 this year and frankly am not sure how I am going to live through today but another day might be ok. Highs and lows.,1094,81,2/26/2021 14:37,lsyxvb
depression,Many pandemic-depressives didn't have empathy for mental health sufferers until it affected them.,"Once the pandemic is over, they'll recover and resume their lives forgetting their empathy for others. 

I've been depressed from childhood  and no one cared. Imagine going through racism, bullying, social exclusion and loneliness from 5 years old to adulthood.

I've put in tremendous efforts in improving myself and meeting people through various ways, yet, I get turned down because of my appearance (race and being not conventionally attractive etc.) or my quiet/ introverted personality and therefore, written off as ""weird"". How wonderful it would be to have friends that genuinely care.

Some of these people posting on social media about caring for others and reaching out are doing it just for the likes and popularity. So many of these phonies are the same assholes that would not give me/ people like me the time of day despite  ""reaching out"" to them. 

They're nothing but insincere and hypocrites that have in the past, contributed to the loneliness and mental health issues of others.

Edit: Thanks for the support and awards.

Also, I changed the ""all"" to ""some"" in the 4th paragraph because SOME of you are so sensitive about that and it was your only takeaway from this entire discussion.",they're finally facing what we had to go through for so long doe. i might sound like a pos but that secretly makes me happy.,1089,39,1/30/2021 18:47,l8sivo

depression,i honestly can't tell if i'm depressed or lazy as shit,"hi everyone, using a throwaway to avoid identification.

as i (19F) write this, i'm on the verge of tears and have a lump in my throat for no discernible reason. before this, i spent the whole day lying in the same spot watching tv, save for the one time i got up to make myself instant noodles. at dinner, i started tearing up because i was disappointed with the food (this is kinda embarrassing). my mum keeps asking me why i'm always lying down (not in a malicious way or anything) and i can't really pinpoint the reason but i'm always unexplainably exhausted. the good days are fine and sometimes really good, but the bad days (like today) just really suck. i feel like i am suspended in time and everything is in slow motion. i have wasted yet another day.

for some context, i'm in a transitional period in my life (graduated from high school, waiting to start college in october). i've had some moments of euphoria here and there that made me feel at the top of the world (got accepted to some really good schools etc.). however, for the most part, nothing really excites me. this is a real low compared to my last 2 years of high school (consistent high achiever, top student for a bunch of subjects, you get the gist) during which i felt some degree of fulfilment because i kept getting told i was good at things. i notice that, when i'm not occupied by the hustle and bustle of school, i always get like this more intensely than otherwise (like during summer vacations).

another thing- every single friend of mine has been motivated enough to get a job and do stuff that excites them. i've barely done anything. the only 2 things i managed to bring myself to do in the last 3 months were the result of me being talked into them by various people. i am a major pushover so obviously i ended up doing them. i just cannot bring myself to apply for a part time job because everyday i just go ""i am tired and i'll do it another day"". i feel like shit because i don't know if i have a problem or if my problem is just that i'm lazy.

my head is really heavy as i write this, so i apologize for my stream-of-consciousness writing style. the reason why i'm so confused is that, when i am in social settings, i'm really lively and fun. i'm also a very typical ""gifted"" kid / overachiever  with much less to worry about that my friends who are on the edges of their seats trying to figure out what to do in the future and shit. i have a loving family and supportive friends. i am grateful for everything i have, but i just get extremely blue and temperamental for no reason sometimes. i don't dare to discuss this with anyone i know because nobody would expect this from me. 

i don't know if this information helps but i typically feel like this during long holidays. basically, if people arent giving me responsibilities, i can't bring myself to do anything.

i'm so sorry i don't have the ability to organise this coherently right now, but could anyone share what depression can feel like? or at least give me a reality check if i really am just lazy and melodramatic? some clarity would be amazing. please be as candid as possible because if it really just is an attitude problem, at least i can stop being self-pitying and start doing something about it. 

just a disclaimer: i have never seriously considered suicide but from time to time i wonder what it would be like to just disappear. don't worry about me being a danger to myself because i would never do it.

that was a really long post. if you read to the end, thank you :)

depression,Is it normal to want to stay depressed?,"I hate being like this, but at the same time I can't stop. It's hard to muster motivation & courage to get out of my head and do things that I \*know\* are good for me. It's like my body and heart are made of lead. Whenever I start to feel good, I ""shut it down"", like it's not right to not feel depressed. It's comfortable in a horrible, twisted way. Why?","i'm not sure if this will apply to everyone, but for me i've always attributed this feeling to inertia as well as a fear of the unknown/change.

after being depressed for such a long time, its become my status quo, so its easier to just stay in that state then to try and enact any change (depressive symptoms are the norm, so they offer the path of least resistance if that makes sense).

on the other hand, there's definitely an anxiety about what my life and i will look like ""post-depression"" (i'm so used to being depressed that i don't know at all what being healthy looks or feels like, so a fear of the unknown kicks in and makes me want to resist treatment or positive change).",1078,98,5/5/2021 19:15,n5o0ny

depression,my genitalia are destroyed after being raped and being prescribed lexapro. i don‚Äôt want to live anymore,"being raped and being on lexapro ruined my genitalia, and it‚Äôs ruining my state of mind. please help

hey yall. not sure how to start this so i think i‚Äôll just get into it. at 12/13 years old, i (f19) started feeling deep depression due to extreme bullying at school. i started therapy, and then lexapro at 17. my anxiety decreased, but i now also had an extremely low sex drive plus genital numbness. i decided that was better than daily panic attacks and constant depression, so i took the pill regularly and properly. 

when i was 18, i was unfortunately raped several times by my long-term boyfriend, who i considered to be the love of my life. what was left of a sex drive was now destroyed, now matched with even deeper depression and incredibly, incredibly low self worth regarding my body and my sex life. 

not long after that, i was diagnosed with spastic pelvic walls, or an extreme form of vaginismus. ive always been incredibly ‚Äòtight‚Äô for a lack of better words, not able to fit a tampon, usually passing out from extreme panic and pain when i tried. i‚Äôm not able to have proper sex because of it. the only time i‚Äôve been penetrated was by my ex when he would rape me, and that was the worst pain of my life, physically and emotionally. 


i‚Äôm now 19, and i‚Äôm in a happy committed relationship. i love him deeply, and he‚Äôs a great partner. however, i find myself so depressed that i can‚Äôt provide for him sexually. not only for his sake, but for mine. my entire genital region is broken, and it makes me feel like less of a woman for it. i understand that a working vagina (or any vagina for that matter) is not what makes a woman, but it‚Äôs the only way i can describe it since there‚Äôs no proper term for female emasculation. 


ive started wellbutrin and stopped lexapro around two weeks ago, and im very anxious to not see any improvement. i also start pelvic floor therapy next month to help with my pelvis spasms. 


i understand that it can take up to three months, but im looking for reassurance from others in the same boat.


i can‚Äôt keep doing this anymore. i hate myself and body, and suicide is constantly on my mind. if anyone has dealt with this or something similar, i‚Äôd love to hear your advice. thank you :)

(please do not tell me that sex isn‚Äôt that important. ive had several people tell me it‚Äôs okay to not have it in our lives, but this is way deeper than that. this is now a physical issue.)","My heart breaks for you. You should be kind to yourself. You are not ruined and you are not broken. You have had traumatic experiences that have contributed to your struggle, but that does not mean hope is lost. Vaginismus is treatable and curable. It is not an easy, overnight fix. It is a lot of work and there will be days that are better than others, but there will be pain free days in your future.

I am speaking as someone who has vaginismus and has gone through some treatment. I am not 100% cured, but I‚Äôm getting there. I have also been on/off different antidepressants during my treatment. 

The pelvic physical therapy helped me a lot, but be prepared as it may stir up a lot of complex and traumatic memories. Do not be afraid to communicate with your physical therapist about boundaries and comfort. 

There is a subreddit for those with vaginismus to get support and ask questions; perhaps reading other‚Äôs experiences will give you some encouragement or insight.",1073,53,2/27/2021 3:11,ltevc3

depression,A therapist just refused to treat me because my life is too fucked up for him to fix.,"Man I'm a fucking mess.  To quote him exactly ""Your case is far too serious I cannot help you with this""  ""You need to be put in a facility with psychiatrists, psychologists, everything"".","Sorry to hear that, I'm in a similar situation currently. However, my therapist explained with a bit more empathy.

The background of this decision is, that processing some traumas or similar things can make you feel even worse before it gets better. If you're already on edge, noome wants to make things worse and then send you off in your own for a week until you meet again.

Because of that, a ward can be helpful, as you're never left alone and are under intensive care, so nothing can happen to you while you're going through all of this. This is meant to make you more stable. When you're out and you're feeling a bit better, you'll get into normal therapy and they don't have to worry about you not coming back for another session.

So both you and I haven't fucked up completely, it'd just be better for us to be watched closer so we don't do anything stupid until things get better again.

Every time I think about committing the act, I start to imagine what her life would be like after my passing.
