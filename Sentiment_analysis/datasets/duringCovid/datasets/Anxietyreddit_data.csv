Anxiety,How to order from subway?,I've been pretty much suffering from social anxiety all my life...but subway just gives me chills. I just can't never gather the guts to order from a subway.

Anxiety,Can we just have a round of applause for restaurants that post their menus online,"It's sooooo much easier going to a restaurant/caf√©/fast food joint/whatever (for the first time) when you can check out the contents and prices of their menus beforehand, and this especially comes in handy to my socially anxious peeps. Sometimes I see a restaurant that looks promising, but I chicken out because I like to have my order locked and loaded before even setting foot at the place.

Also, this doubles as a plea to all restaurants- if you didn't alreday do it, I'M BEGGING YOU please post your menus online, whether on your website, your IG story highlights, or in an album on Facebook.","I don't understand how some people live.

Anxiety,At the end of my first ever session my therapist said something I‚Äôll never forget,"EDIT: WOW! Thank you so much guys for your kind words! I‚Äôm in the UK and have just woke up to all of this positivity. I knew reddit was an awesome place but this has just confirmed it even more. We all deserve contentment, thank you so much üíï

So after years of childhood trauma, anxiety and depression I finally got to a stage where I could afford decent therapy and had my first session today. My therapist seems really nice and her little room was the perfect environment for me to feel comfortable talking.

At the end she asked me what I wanted from therapy. As I was telling her all about me and my life, I was constantly worried about her thinking I was overreacting, judging my stories or thinking them not serious enough to require therapy and that I was just a weak person. She looked at my blankly and said ‚Äòis it a big deal for you?‚Äô I said, ‚Äòyes, massively‚Äô and she just simply replied ‚Äòwell then it‚Äôs a big deal...‚Äô, and just shrugged her shoulders and started talking about our next session.

Honestly it was like an epiphany. I realised that if something is a big deal in MY universe, then it is a big deal because it‚Äôs me that matters and someone else not thinking it‚Äôs serious does NOT invalidate that. I‚Äôm always so anxious that my problems will seem silly to someone else, but actually if they really care about helping you get through it, they won‚Äôt judge the nature of the problem but try and help you through it anyway because they know it‚Äôs a serious problem to you. Your problems are all valid and they‚Äôre all worth fixing guys, don‚Äôt ever forget that xx","Thank you so much for sharing, it was nice to read. Sending you love",3339,68,7/13/2020 19:18,hqlsf8

Anxiety,"Anxiety is when you can't do anything, because you're worried that you're gonna do it wrong.",,Or being so overwhelmed by everything you have to do that you shut down and do nothing,3033,54,7/24/2020 17:02,hx5k0f
Anxiety,Anybody else ever find themselves staying up late purely to make it feel like there‚Äôs more time between now and tomorrow??,I have work in the morning and my brain is like ‚Äúif you stay up til 1 then you have another half an hour to relax before going to sleep & waking up anxious for work‚Äù,"100% , then I will use sleep in the morning to escape shit.

Anxiety,Anyone else feel like they are wasting their life by focusing on just having the day be over - but every day?,"Every day I have this anxiety about work, and every day I tel myself ‚Äúwell it‚Äôll be over at 5pm‚Äù and then I have the evening but I go to bed very early because I‚Äôm tired of being anxious all day and then do it all over again in the morning. I feel like I‚Äôve lost months of time like this. I don‚Äôt want to let my life disappear into just waiting for the days to be over.",This is my every day life. I'm essentially living for the end of the day so I can attempt to sleep and fail the next day. Rinse and repeat. I have no idea how to break the cycle.,2716,102,9/14/2020 12:21,isjt2m
Anxiety,Does anyone else constantly feel like they‚Äôve done something wrong after social interactions?,"Basically the title. I constantly feel like I‚Äôve done or said something wrong or offensive and somebody is mad at me after social interactions. Especially with my family and friends. Even if the interactions ended positively and with hugs goodbye and such. I don‚Äôt have a bad relationship with any of them. I don‚Äôt consider myself anti social. I‚Äôve mentioned this to my husband and some friends and have been told it‚Äôs all in my head basically(in the nicest way possible). My husband will reassure me that I‚Äôve done nothing wrong and no one is mad at me, but I usually have a really hard time shaking the feeling and sometimes it even lasts into the next day. It happens all the time. He and others will say even if someone is mad at me that they‚Äôll get over it, probably before I even see them again and I shouldn‚Äôt worry about it, but for some reason I can‚Äôt shake the guilty feeling. Is this just me?

EDIT:  I never expected this post to get the response that it did. I want to reply to everyone, but don‚Äôt want to be a broken record either. I‚Äôm sorry you all are suffering with this as well and I hope we all find some relief someday. It really helps me to know I‚Äôm not alone in these feelings. I hope knowing you‚Äôre not alone brings you some relief as well. And I‚Äôm nobody special, but if anyone ever needs to talk or share experiences I‚Äôm here.","All. The. Time. 

I feel like I‚Äôm constantly replaying every single interaction non stop and criticizing what I said or didn‚Äôt say and assuming all the horrible things and judgments others must be thinking. 

I try to shut it down whenever these thoughts start by telling myself nobody else is thinking about me or obsessing about what I said and to let it go. 

Have you ever looked up a list of cognitive distortions and tried challenging your thoughts when you start to analyze an interaction and going down the rabbit hole? It‚Äôs hard but sometimes doing a reality check that my thought is actually a worse case scenario or unrealistic black and white thinking, for example, and not necessarily true just because it popped into my head can be really helpful.",2589,103,5/11/2020 7:06,ghiqy2
Anxiety,"Anxiety Pro Tip: Anxiety thrives on your avoidance. If you have an anxiety-provoking task to do, make it your first task of the day. Otherwise, it'll only start to feel scarier and harder to complete in your mind.","Avoiding the anxiety-provoking task feels good in the short term because your brain feels like it has avoided some kind of threat. This is one of the reasons why procrastination feels so good! However, avoiding the task just reinforces your belief that the task *is* a threatening one, so the anxiety gets more intense the next time you come to it. 

Making it your first task will eliminate this vicious cycle altogether. You'll likely feel better as you'll get a sense of achievement from ""beating"" the anxiety-provoking thing. There is also the added bonus that it won't be nagging the back of your mind for the rest of the day!

All credit for this tip goes to u/TomClinPsy who posted it elsewhere but it was removed for some reason. Luckily I had screenshot it because it felt so profound to me.","This is so spot on for me. I have severe anxiety and I struggle with the simplest of tasks. Mopping the floor can take me a month because I‚Äôll put it off til the next morning. Then the evening. Rinse repeat.

I can put off shopping until my cupboards are bare and sometimes go through withdrawal because I can‚Äôt do something as simple as refill a repeat prescription.

An interaction on one of my posts today had me realise that the more I ruminate over tasks, the more daunting they become. 

One of the household chores I never seem to struggle with for example, has always been the dishes. Because it‚Äôs never been something I‚Äôve put on my mental to do list. I tend to wash a couple of dishes while I‚Äôm waiting for the kettle to boil or waiting for the microwave to ping etc etc and they just get done. 

But mopping the floor becomes an impossible task because I overthink it. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt just mop the floor. I‚Äôve gotta sweep first. Then I have to pick up all the stuff on the floor. Then I‚Äôve gotta make up the bucket etc etc etc. Oh and there‚Äôs no point having a clean floor if the stove is dirty. So I have to clean that first and then the wall tiles are gonna look weird if the floor is all shiny. So I‚Äôll have to clean those too... then the windows will need doing. Eh. There‚Äôs no time for all that now‚Äù then I‚Äôve made it into a whole thing. 

Stupid example, but that‚Äôs pretty much how I approach everything in life and I‚Äôm just sat here on my arse doing nothing with my life at 32 because making a phone call is too hard",2579,37,5/20/2020 17:17,gnfhvp
Anxiety,Anyone else more anxious about COVID restrictions being lifted than they were about them being implemented?,"I have adapted really well to the social isolation and working from home thing. I have a great routine now (way more balance with work/life/health than I did pre-covid) and love having more time to spend with my pets, reading & contemplating. All the zoom meetings for work and maybe 1-2 virtual ‚Äúcatch ups‚Äù with friends every week are adequate for me socially. 

However when I think about how I‚Äôll have to go back to my typical 8-5 grind with a 2 hour commute on top of those hours, I feel super anxious. Anybody else in a similar boat? 

Note I‚Äôm not saying I hope covid continues to thrive, I know it has had a severely negative impact on many people. I am just anxious at the thought of returning to what was my ‚Äúnormal life‚Äù that I hated.","It‚Äôs very strange to me how well I‚Äôve adapted to things. Over the past couple months I‚Äôve dropped several bad habits, some of them years old, and developed many good ones - out of necessity, mind you, but it‚Äôs been working for me. Overall, I‚Äôm in a much better headspace than I was at the start of this. 

I‚Äôm very introverted and strongly dislike my line of work, so there‚Äôs that. But my general anxiety has been much more manageable and not having to deal with the pressures of day-to-day life has been undeniably positive for me. I do miss my friends, but many of them are people I go weeks or even months without meeting with even when we‚Äôre not in quarantine.

I‚Äôm in the same boat as you - while I sincerely want covid-19 to end for the sake of the greater good, I am not ready to return to my normal life.",2552,134,4/27/2020 6:13,g8v0l8
Anxiety,"Does anyone else get worried/panicked that they‚Äôre wasting years of their life being anxious and that one day you‚Äôll look back and see how much of your life you spent feeling negative, never to reclaim those years? üòì","This often comes over me and I stress so much that I‚Äôll spend so many years feeling so negative and anxious, only to waste my life doing so and not able to live my life to the full.

EDIT: Thank you so much for all your comments/upvotes/awards. I feel a lot better knowing I‚Äôm not alone, although I wouldn‚Äôt wish this feeling on anyone else! We can do this guys!","I have done this. I felt I wasted my 20's playing video games, binge drinking and eating crap with nothing to show for it and feeling shitty. 

However I recently turned 30 and in a moment  of 'now or never' I decided to devote more time to my wellbeing and improving some of my hobbies and taking up some new ones, as well as focusing on what was truly important in my life. You're never too old to make that change, the past is yesterday's problem. 

Keep moving forward and try not too look back but if you do decide to look back, focus on the good times and memories and silence those inner voices telling you you wasted your time.

Anxiety,Having anxiety and depression at the same time is not have enough energy to get up and brush your teeth but then anxiety making you worry about loosing all of your teeth till you get up and brush your teeth,,"Unsolicited advice time that really helped me!

Can‚Äôt shower? Can I convince myself to at least clean my hair in the sink? (I‚Äôm a guy so my hair isn‚Äôt particularly long)

Can‚Äôt fold laundry? Can I at least separate it into different piles based on what it is? That way, I don‚Äôt need to fish through my unfolded laundry for a shirt, I can just grab something from the clean shirt pile.

Anxiety,I don‚Äôt think most people understand how exhausting the physical symptoms of anxiety are,"There‚Äôs a lot of physical symptoms such as shaking, fidgeting, heavy breathing, rapid breathing, getting extremely overheated, rapid heartbeat, stomach pain, nausea, bathroom issues, etc. I think most people just assume it‚Äôs completely internal, but man it can be exhausting.

Anxiety,"I actually did it. Found an amazing new job in a much better city, faced my boss to quit my current job. Found a house, turned on utilities, and scheduled movers.","I'm not going to lie.

It really made clear that the only way to deal with things is literally just to face them head on. I wasn't going to have this amazing new house or job unless I pushed myself through. Period. 

If you're going through something and its hard to follow through, or hard to even start. Just try and think about the end goal, not the process. It doesnt make it easy.

Anxiety,"I‚Äôm an italian OCD and anxiety sufferer, and I‚Äôm here to tell you that it‚Äôs going to be okay.","I know you probably don‚Äôt believe me, but it WILL get better and easier. I know it sounds scary when governments start to put out all of those limitations and lockdowns, but it‚Äôs for the better. 

If you‚Äôre starting quarantine or are obligated to stay home just like we are, I promise you‚Äôll get used to it. And not used to it in a negative way! There are so many things you can do at home: I baked so many cakes, I‚Äôm trying to do the splits, I‚Äôm reading all the books I never got a chance to read. Isolation is reaaally not that bad.

We have the amazing power of adaptation. Every tool you have learned to cope with your anxiety will come in super handy, and you‚Äôll see how strong you are with them.

Sending you all a giant hug. We‚Äôre in this shit together.

And please, remember this pro tip: check what is necessary to check on the news. And that means check only what YOU as a citizen need to do. Numbers will go super high, then super low, then high and low again... it‚Äôs a pain that you really don‚Äôt need in your everyday life. If it‚Äôs impossible for you to resist the urge, have a trusted loved one tell you the necessary things you need to know: if there are new limitations, if you can go to school / work , what you should do with your hands etc.

Anxiety,Healthy people talk about anxiety as if it‚Äôs something you can control...,"‚ÄúJust breathe!‚Äù ‚ÄúThink positively.‚Äù ‚ÄúWorrying only makes you suffer twice.‚Äù Ya know, those kinds of saying. 

I wish it was that easy. If I could control it, it wouldn‚Äôt be called an illness. 

This morning I woke up feeling perfectly fine (which is rare), was sitting on my couch reading then all of the sudden, my heart started beating so fast for no fucking reason, and I started hyperventilating. It took like 2 hours to collect myself and I had no idea what that whole episode was about.

So don‚Äôt tell me it‚Äôs something I can control, I had a panic attack while thinking about literally nothing.

Edit: Thank you to all the healthy people that replied to this post saying: ‚ÄúWe mean well‚Äù. I get that. But it‚Äôs not helpful at all, when we‚Äôre venting and your first reaction is defensiveness. Sometimes all we want is to be heard.

Anxiety,Does anybody else have anxiety on your days off because you are ‚Äúwasting‚Äù it doing nothing?,"I have been like this for years but I feel it‚Äôs been worse lately because of COVID and the fact that I‚Äôve been working from home. I always felt anxious/guilty when I would relax, hangout inside and play video games on my days off by myself. I felt like I was supposed to be doing something productive, exercising the dog, etc. But I was working a more labor intensive job before. I now have a desk call center job and have been stuck working from home since March. So on my days off, if I don‚Äôt have plans, I‚Äôm still home and feel like I should be out doing something. But some weekends I just want to do nothing, even if it‚Äôs beautiful out (I usually pray for rainy days when I‚Äôm off so I feel less guilty.) I also hate the heat so when it‚Äôs too hot, I don‚Äôt want to be outside. AND I usually get house chores done on my first day off so I can relax later but I still am anxious all day because I‚Äôm relaxing and playing video games. I feel like I waste my all my days off thinking of things I SHOULD have done and then when I go back to work, I feel like I wasted all my days off thinking of things I should be doing instead of mentally relaxing. I‚Äôve honestly found myself either drinking or getting High more on my days off just so I can forget these feelings and relax.

*Edit to add, I‚Äôm also more introverted so making plans with friends can be exhausting but I do it and have fun every time. Recently all my weekends have been jam packed with plans so I wouldn‚Äôt feel like this but apparently it doesn‚Äôt work that way!","Totally get what you mean, I had/have the same issue with feeling like aaaah why am I not creating/doing useful stuff/exercising/bettering myself every minute of every day! 

I personally think it‚Äôs super common in younger folk (don‚Äôt know if that applies to you) - we‚Äôve grown up in an unstable economic situation, and we‚Äôre constantly reminded that our productivity and ability to make money define us and our futures. It‚Äôs an ingrained idea - and it‚Äôs obvious in the hustle/monetise your hobbies culture that‚Äôs so pervasive at the moment. 

That aside, being productive is great, but there are plenty of things that are equally or more valuable than being productive. Doing things you enjoy is definitely one of them! Taking time to unwind, destress, play video games, read, browse Reddit, whatever makes you happy, is a valuable and worthwhile use of your time. Is it productive? Maybe not in the traditional sense. But I like to think that the ‚Äòproduct‚Äô is improved mental health, relaxation, happiness - maybe not as tangible as your work days, but arguably more important. 

It‚Äôs an easy thing to accept, but hard to put into practice (from my experience, anyway). But I hope that you can work towards letting yourself have unproductive and fun days, as often as is possible - you‚Äôre only going to have one shot at life and you may as well enjoy it :)",2289,85,8/2/2020 20:52,i2jiqh

Anxiety,"Does anyone else get anxious when being yelled at, or just hearing someone raise their voice?",I've noticed here recently that my chest gets tight and I can hardly breathe when being yelled at or hearing someone raise their voice in general. Does anyone have a way to calm themselves when this happens?,"I don't have any advice, but yeah, I don't like people yelling or raising their voices. I've never liked conflict, even if it wasn't directed at me. I used to cry even at 17 as my dad yelled at my addict and alcoholic older brother. If I didn't mind my dad yelling, I wouldn't still be having nightmares about arguments 5 years after moving out. People lecturing me/talking to me in a disapproving way is enough to make me cry and shut down. Something in particular comes to mind. I also had nightmares from that. I've tried explaining to people even if they aren't physically yelling at me, my reaction is no different than if they were. It's all the same to me if someone is upset with me.

Anxiety,I lost my companion of 18 years. People don‚Äôt understand how important a pet can be for people with anxiety/mental illness.,"I adopted my cat as a kitten when I was in grad school. I would not be where I am in my life without his love. Pets hold a special place for people with anxiety.  He was there providing comfort when I had bad days. He gave me purpose when I felt I had none. He gave me unconditional love. I didn‚Äôt have to worry about my insecurities around him. He loved me as I was. He was with me when I hit my rock bottom. He was with me during my years long recovery cheering me on and providing support during the low times. He gave me companionship when I would isolate because the world was too much to take.  He was my spirit animal. He had anxiety too and took Prozac. He was excited when I got home and would cry when I left, sometimes when I even just left the room. He loved me and I loved him and I will forever miss him and cherish the blessing he was in my life.

Edit: thank you everyone for your kind words. They do provide comfort. And thank you for the golds.

I have a great support system and a wonderful fianc√©. She was with me at the vet when we had to put him to sleep.

No.  Dry cough?  No.  Does anyone else have to keep themselves in check like this?",Yup my main symptoms are always chest pain and shortness of breath to the point I feel like yawning and gasping for air. Right now I have had a super dry throat and a sensation of having something stuck there for about three weeks and a cough that I think is me trying to get rid of that sensation. Of course this is making me panic more but I'm trying to remind myself the the mind is a crazy thing and all of these sensations are commonly experienced as a symptom of anxiety.

It‚Äôs the busiest season for my niche-insurance market and I‚Äôm tired from working 45-50hr work weeks. My anxiety keeps me from taking off work knowing I‚Äôll feel guilty for not helping the company when they need me the most. 

Funny enough, as a result of this I was recognized for ‚Äúoutstanding attendance‚Äù which quickly made me realize I‚Äôm the only one not taking time off after it was announced that taking time off would be harder this time of year. Give me a freaking break. 

Anyways I took the day off to let someone else get that recognition for this month.",My daughter is in high school and they pile it n the homework. Sometimes she stays up until 11 or 12 doing it.

Even though you are scared, you are safe. Even though you are scared, you are loved. I love you. I don‚Äôt know you, but if people can hate indiscriminately, I can love indiscriminately. I love you. There is love all around you in little, gentle ways. 

When someone smiles at you, they are sharing a small bit of love. When someone lets you pass in traffic or lets you merge, they are offering you a tiny bit of love.

Every ‚Äúplease‚Äù and ‚Äúthank you‚Äù is love. Even when something is someone‚Äôs job - such as a store clerk wishing you a good day, or the coffee shop person chatting you up per corporate policy. They are still extending love.

Accept the little moments of love.

Accept the little moments of safety, too.

Right now, in this moment in time, you are safe.

It is okay to be afraid. I still love you. Do you love you? You must.

Hold yourself, please. Do it for me. Put your arms around yourself. Pet your face gently. Tell yourself, ‚ÄúI love you. You are safe. It is okay to be afraid. There is nothing wrong with you. You are human and you are feeling afraid and I am here with you.‚Äù

Do not treat yourself with contempt and do not abandon yourself for being afraid. You deserve unconditional love. Stay with yourself and be kind to yourself even though you are struggling.

Tell yourself, ‚ÄúI will not abandon you. I will not judge you. I will not reject you just because you are afraid.‚Äù

Keep your promise to yourself.

Tell yourself ‚ÄúI love you, sweetheart.‚Äù

When you are ready, share a small bit of love with others. Smile to them. Say please and thank you. Wish them well. Be kind. Let them merge in traffic. Do it without expectation for something in return.

Pick up a piece of trash because you love the park. Say, ‚ÄúI love you park. Let me help you feel nice. It‚Äôs okay. I got this.‚Äù (Even if you just say it in your head).

Radiate love and safety. Receive love and safety.

AMAZINGLY GOOD NEWS!!!!!!

A Chicago hospital that tested antibodies found 30 percent of those tested had antibodies.

https://chicagocitywire.com/stories/530092711-roseland-hospital-phlebotomist-30-of-those-tested-have-coronavirus-antibody

Magnifying this percentage to the entire USA population, that would mean the death rate for the virus is 0.015 percent, about on par with the seasonal flu.

some really good news regarding asymptomatic spread! 

Per Wuhan Health Commission, the 300 asymptomatic carrier identified by large scale PCR testing between 15/05/2020 and 01/06/2020 have had their saliva and throat swab sample taken, and these samples have undergone isolation and incubation experiment at Chinese Academy of Science Wuhan. All samples have failed to result in incubation of live virus.

Experts believe the negative result of incubation experiments with the saliva and throat swab sample point at either minuscule viral load, or non-viable viral fragments unable to cause infection. Furthermore, samples from toothbrush, drinking cups, masks, towels and other personal effects have been taken from the 300 asymptomatic carriers, all have tested negative. On top of this, 1174 close contacts of the 300 asymptomatic carriers identified have all tested negative on PCR tests. All of these point at the conclusion that the asymptomatic carriers discovered in Wuhan are not infectious.

Anxiety,Today I had a job interview and I managed to go. No one seems to understand that for some people it's a tremendous struggle.,"I have really bad IBS with panic-/anxiety disorder and those two combined make it extremely difficult to travel. I don't have a car so I have to use the public transport.

90% of the time when I leave the house I get the runs. Like really bad. Almost always I have to turn back, take a shit and try again. Sometimes it doesn't work and I can't go. Not even to the grocery store for example.

I've used meds (benzos) for it for a while which usually work, but whenever I try to seek help the nr1 concern is "" well you gotta get rid of those pills "". I don't care a flying fuck if I'm injecting heroine if I manage to go to work, leave the house, do normal stuff.

Not even 1% of people can fathom the struggle some people have to just go buy groceries.

I've tried to seek help with this but every single time **only** thing I hear is "" stop using meds "". I've used benzos 3 times in past 3 weeks. I'm improving, no one cares. I'm working on my diet and excercise, no one cares. All I hear is "" stop using meds, stop using meds "". From medical professionals, family and friends.

True, meds might make it so that without them normal things become more difficult. But my goal for now is to travel to work. Any means necessary. Okay I stop meds then what ? No one gives me the step 2.

I've been unemployed for 6 months and my nr1 goal is to get a job, manage to get there and do well.

Thanks for the rant. Peace.

Edit/update:

Had a dr's appointment today.  I told her several times that my only goal is to travel to work. I said very clearly that I still need help, but I didn't care if it was in a form of benzo's, other meds or therapy.

As a result she prescribed more benzo's. And psyllium seeds. Also according to her, stomach problems and panic disorder are completely unrelated and have nothing to do with eachother... sigh.","Trust me, I understand completely. How you feel, is how I have felt in the past and even now when I feel somewhat better. Doesn't take much to send me all the way back to square one and I can't leave the house.

Anxiety,The best gift I could have gotten on Christmas,"My teenage son has OCD and for the last year+ his brain has been telling him that I am ‚Äúinfected‚Äù so he often won‚Äôt stay in the same room as me, sometimes won‚Äôt talk to me, races away from me and won‚Äôt touch things that I‚Äôve touched.

It‚Äôs incredibly challenging and hurts my heart.

For Christmas, he said I get a hug. I could see him taking deep breaths (subtly) and preparing himself. I asked how long I could hug him and he said as long as I wanted. When I hugged him, I asked him if I could give him a kiss, too, and he said yes, so I kissed his head.

It filled my heart with so much warmth and peace and happiness and I can still feel it a couple hours later.

I truly understand anxiety and I know just how difficult this was for him. It was the most selfless and loving and special gift I could have gotten.

Also, as a side note, my older son got me an extra gift for my stocking because I‚Äôm divorced and this is my first Christmas as a single woman. (I invited their father over last year to help them with the transition, but not this year). My son wanted to be sure I had something in my stocking since my ex always did that for me.

I feel so loved by my thoughtful sons.","As an adult in my early 20‚Äôs who‚Äôs been battling with Health Anxiety OCD since I was 10, this warmed my heart. It was incredibly difficult for him to fight those intrusive thoughts and lies in his head. But he was able to fight those thoughts and won. Not only did you have a good day today receiving love from him, please understand he probably had an even better day because he just made huge progress with his battle with OCD.

I am very impressed someone at such a young age was able to shut down those thoughts for once.

Anxiety,I absolutely hate being a high-functioning person with generalized & social anxiety disorder.,"I go through my day and no one knows how much effort it takes me to fake socializing, to fake talking to people, most people just assume I'm a bitch at first until they get to know me because I don't speak up very much but when I do, I sound confident.. but only because I FORCE myself to. 

I get most things done on my checklist. I workout, I eat healthy, I have a degree, I'm in a relationship, I pay my bills, I seem like I have my shit together. But I don't. I spend most of my time over-analzying things I've said, walking around faking everything all day, worried I can't trust anyone around me and over-analzying my relationship, calling myself a loser, telling myself I'm not good enough, having PTSD flashbacks from an abusive childhood. And it's wild that no one has any idea. And I'll never let them know. Because I'm embarrassed.

So if you see someone who seems like they have their shit together or you're jealous, or you think they just don't talk to you a lot because they don't like you.. maybe consider that they are high-functioning. I think we tend to forget that depression & anxiety don't only present as not being able to get out of bed or do anything.",Thank you for posting this. I‚Äôve gotten very good at faking it and I‚Äôve reached my breaking point. I‚Äôm on day 10 of Zoloft and hoping for a bit of relief soon,1734,81,10/23/2020 1:11,jgczkl
Anxiety,"Does anyone else get avoidance anxiety from text messages, emails, Reddit mail, any electronic correspondence?","Like I enjoy chatting with people in person, over the phone I don‚Äôt mind, either. With new people I get slight anxiety but it‚Äôs not crippling in any way. 

However, for some reason e-correspondence really gets me. Especially talking to people who are very pushy and demanding for quick replies. I don‚Äôt always feel like answering at the moment so I‚Äôll put it off, but then I get very anxious knowing the reply is waiting for me, and I ignore it, and it makes me more anxious thinking the person is getting angry at me, and it‚Äôs a very vicious cycle. 

The only time I don‚Äôt feel this way is when I‚Äôm either very busy working (and then I use the messages as a welcome distraction) or when I take Adderall for ADHD, because then I feel very assertive and have no fear. 

I think the lock down has made things worse because now I don‚Äôt go to the gym (usual fear release) and there‚Äôs no social time to replenish my mind in preparation for online messages, since they take a lot of mental effort. 

I‚Äôm curious to see if anyone else experiences this, and hopefully I won‚Äôt avoid your replies üòÜ

=========

Edit: Lmao this post blew up, and now I have 40+ replies to read. The irony is astounding! But I am to hear everyone else‚Äôs experiences too. 

I was thinking more and part of it may be due to the fact that each online message represents another demand on our time and another decision we must make. At least that‚Äôs part of the issue. And diverts from our energy when already in an inert place.

Take care of yourselves, everyone >< Gonna go take a relaxing bath after reading the replies here",I never knew this had a name!! I 100% relate to having avoidance anxiety and never heard anyone else put how I feel into words.,1731,88,3/27/2020 23:54,fq8z5a
Anxiety,When you realize you aren‚Äôt anxious and it triggers your anxiety,great thanks,"Thinking about my anxiety whether I‚Äôm feeling it or not atm causes it to spike so much.

Anxiety,I think I prefer depression over anxiety,"After a very anxious week I feel burnt out. Now I feel just depressed, the kind of depressive state that is tolerable. 

I feel no sadness and anger, I am just tired and indifferent. My brain is so tired that I have no energy to be anxious. That kinda feels good. Without paralyzing terror I can do small things, not overly passionate, but just good enough. 

My baseline is so low, that I feel happy being just depressed.
_____
Edit: I think it needs to be here, ‚ÄòObjectively, depression and anxiety both suck, sometimes **the change** from months long depression to anxiety, and vice versa, **feels better**. Then you realize it is not energy or motivation but anxiety, it is not calmness it is numbness from depression. I really hope you will get better and find help, because those changes between those two are sometimes very misleading, and can be a false promise. Do not postpone the therapy or whatever you were meaning to do or start. And change that baseline of feeling good to a higher norm‚Äô.",I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not the only one who feels this way.,1708,134,6/9/2020 16:39,gzqpsw
Anxiety,I just realised the reason I panic when I make mistakes is because I was punished for mistakes in my childhood.,"One of my earliest memories is from when I was about 4 years old. While I was playing in the garden I fell over and injured my hand. My knuckle was bleeding quite a lot and I still have a scar from the injury to this day. Crying, I ran inside to my mother.

After treating my wound, she spanked me as punishment for my mistake.

If my mother had decided to give me comfort and reassurance in these kinds of situations, maybe in my adulthood, when I made a mistake, my natural response would be to try to soothe myself and calm down.

Instead, when I make a mistake, my natural response is to feel anxiety or panic, and it's really difficult for me to calm down.

I'm hoping that this realisation will be the first step towards me being able to overwrite my childhood conditioning and learn how to treat myself with acceptance and understanding.","Same. My childhood was a shit-show, and now I hate myself because I dwell on every little mistake I've ever made.",1697,70,7/10/2020 10:58,homwjx

Anxiety,"Guys, not only did I get a decent job after not working for 4 years but I haven't called or been late yet after my first week!","Im a terrible flake when it comes to work. My anxiety goes up right before i go in and I end up getting sick and calling off or just not showing up. I'm a terribly unreliable worker.

4 years ago I went thru a tumultuous divorce from a marriage making my anxiety worse everyday. So from then on I've been out of work and my partner has been taking care of me. A series of events that I'd rather not go into happened and I was pushed to finally get back into the work force. 

Im an animal person and for some months been debating on going to school to become a vet tech. On the 11th I got hired to work at an animal shelter I use to occasionally volunteer for. The director was slightly reluctant to hire me because again I was a flake during volunteering partly because my anxiety/overall mental health and the fact it wasn't a real job made me not take it seriously. 

Well its been my first week and I haven't had any panic attacks at work or felt the urge to call off or been late. I hope i can keep this up as I really like my job and the staff is pretty good. 

I feel like I've turned the corner on my anxieties and hope i can go back to being the strong person I once was.

Anxiety,Sending everyone hugs tonight.,"You know who you are. You‚Äôre me, obsessively refreshing the worldnews and politics thread because you can‚Äôt sleep and you can‚Äôt stop thinking about it.  
  
And then you‚Äôre thinking about Australia and the fires, or the flu going around, or how your stomach has been in knots today and you didn‚Äôt eat dinner and now taking a shower seems impossible because there‚Äôs so much happening and you need to know what‚Äôs going to happen next.  
  
I want you to know you‚Äôre not alone, no matter what happens. I may not know you, but I am right there with you, and we can share this together. No matter what happens.  
  
Sending you all so many hugs.

Dear everyone,  
  
I am writing to let you know I am reading each and every single one of your comments. I made this post because I saw many posts talking about how scared folks are. Truth be told, I am scared too. I'm scared everyday. That's life with anxiety. Sometimes it is really small and it feels like I can just ""ignore"" it and put it in my back pocket, and sometimes it is really huge and like a gigantic elephant stomping around in my brain.  
  
I recognize the tendency in myself to get caught up in negative feedback loops (including obsessively reading about horrible things and obsessing over current events) and decided I would post something somewhat different for us because sometimes, just being honest, coming to /r/anxiety can leave me feeling a bit more anxious, lol.  
  
Whatever the case, I want to thank you all once again for taking the time to share your thoughts and feelings. It is good to know we're not alone. There are so many of us out there who want to see good things come out in the world. I want to share a passage that is comforting to me when things become difficult, and hope maybe it will be of some small comfort to y'all as well.  
  
>""The life of Man is a long march through the night, surrounded by invisible foes, tortured by weariness and pain, towards a goal that few can hope to reach, and where none may tarry long. One by one, as they march, our comrades vanish from our sight, seized by the silent orders of omnipotent Death. Very brief is the time in which we can help them, in which their happiness or misery is decided. Be it ours to shed sunshine on their path, to lighten their sorrows by the balm of sympathy, to give them the pure joy of a never-tiring affection, to strengthen failing courage, to instil faith in hours of despair. Let us not weigh in grudging scales their merits and demerits, but let us think only of their need--of the sorrows, the difficulties, perhaps the blindnesses, that make the misery of their lives; let us remember that they are fellow-sufferers in the same darkness, actors in the same tragedy as ourselves. And so, when their day is over, when their good and their evil have become eternal by the immortality of the past, be it ours to feel that, where they suffered, where they failed, no deed of ours was the cause; but wherever a spark of the divine fire kindled in their hearts, we were ready with encouragement, with sympathy, with brave words in which high courage glowed.""

Anxiety,Anyone else anxious and scared about lockdown being lifted and having to attain responsibility and normality again?,"I've never had much of an issue with being in quarantine, I liked being able to stay inside and watch television or listen to music all day.

Anxiety,I just broke down crying because it feels like no one wants to listen to a man say that he's struggling,"I tried bringing up my struggles with anxiety and depression today and either they don't answer or just tell me they love me, which I appreciate but no one every wants to know what I'm actually feeling and I can only get so much relief from writing in a journal. It's just not the same. Everyone always immediately backs up my girlfriend when she is struggling and I'm just supposed to figure it out.","You are worthy of finding support and you are still a man despite your struggles. My advice is that you NEED to find a counsellor asap because really your gf ought to offer at least some mutual support, which is the basis of all relationships. But you also can‚Äôt place it all onto her if she has her own struggles.

Anxiety,Having anxiety is a full time job you don't get paid for,"Well, maybe that's not how it is for everyone, but I am always in my head. Thinking, Planning, problem solving, and of course, worrying. Then worrying some more. I'm never in the current moment, my mind is always in the future. Before I know it, the day is over, and I have barely acknowledged/talked to anybody and barely looked anyone in the eye.

I'm not miserable, I just need to get out of of my head, stop worrying with my mind jumping from one thing to the next, stop getting frustrated and irritated, stop overthinking everything, and instead actually live life and enjoy it.","I‚Äôll have (on paper) simple days that end up feeling like 12 hours of tedious labor and I just revel in getting a handful of tasks checked off.

Anxiety,Do you guys need constant reassurance that everyone is not mad at you?,"I always assume the worst. And now that we‚Äôre have to practice social distancing it‚Äôs making it a lot easier to think negative thoughts. I know they are irrational but sometimes my mind just convinces me that they are true.

I guess since I haven‚Äôt physically seen any of my friends it has gotten really had to stay on track mentally. Like before of this quarantine started we use to spend almost all day everyday together, now everything is through text and for me, I would rather talk to someone face to face so I know what their tone of voice is. Sometimes my mind just thinks really stupid things and it‚Äôs really hard to stop it. Does anybody else feel this way too?","I so relate to this. You're not alone at all! I also get that feeling when saying what I feel about certain situations by text with all of this quarantine thing since I can't say that in person, so it's guilt + the need of knowing that people aren't mad.

Anxiety,Does anyone else feel like their outlook on life is incredibly dependent on how anxious they‚Äôre feeling at any given moment?,"First time posting/visiting the sub, as my anxiety just seems to be getting worse.

I‚Äôm a senior in college and the uncertainty that lies ahead of me is unbearable. I‚Äôll go through rough phases where everything, from classes to planning for careers/grad school seems like the most daunting thing, and I just wish to stay in the present. I can‚Äôt see a light, and I feel so trapped inside myself it‚Äôs debilitating.

Other days, or periods of time shorter than days, I‚Äôll feel like I have the ability to be and do great. In those few and far in between instances I feel sane, and relatively calm, eager for the future.

What I can‚Äôt stand the most is not controlling how i feel, and when I feel it. It‚Äôs so volatile and I can only hope that days in which important tasks take place are days I feel I‚Äôm in control.

Anxiety,One of the worst things about anxiety is that a good day with your friends can end with you convinced that they all hate you,"I hate that even if I‚Äôm having fun with my friends and meeting new amazing people, I spend the entire night staying up obsessing over all of the little things that I could have possibly done wrong to make people dislike me.

Anxiety,Does anyone else get anxious when they hear any type of yelling?,"Before I start, I want to mention that I have not been diagnosed with anxiety so far, but this is the only community where I feel like I can let this out and ask this question. (Also im new to Reddit and don‚Äôt know how exactly this works, so if I do anything wrong please let me know) 

So I‚Äôm currently 18 years old and as for my childhood I‚Äôd say it was okay. I was a pretty shy and ‚Äògood‚Äô kid so never got into trouble much. That‚Äôs also why I can‚Äôt recall ever being yelled at or hit. Maybe once, but my parent did apologise and state what they did wasn‚Äôt okay so I don‚Äôt think that would have affected me.

However, I get so anxious when I hear anybody yell. It doesn‚Äôt even have to be directed at me. A few examples: one of my teachers has a pretty strong, loud voice. When he suddenly calls out a student‚Äôs name while I‚Äôm doing my homework, I pretty much flinch even though his tone isn‚Äôt even angry. 

Or a few weeks ago when a classmate wasn‚Äôt wearing a mask, a teacher followed them into our classroom and basically yelled at them for at least a minute. While this was going on, I forced myself to just look down at my notebook and focus on anything but the yelling. Though I tried to distract myself, my eyes were teary and I felt a lump in my throat and I was really tense for the rest of that class. I think that was the most anxious I had felt in years. 

My sibling who is 12 can be described as a ‚Äòtroublemaker‚Äô I guess. They‚Äôre the opposite of me which can be good at times, but it sometimes gets on my parents‚Äô nerves. They don‚Äôt listen, aren‚Äôt okay with being told ‚Äúno‚Äù and pretty much do what they want when they feel like it. Because of this I often hear my parents being upset at them and I‚Äôve heard my parent yell at them a lot. Sometimes I‚Äôd be in the same room, other times I‚Äôd be in my room and they‚Äôd be downstairs. During these times I‚Äôll also get very tense and just have a horrible feeling. If I‚Äôm in the same room I won‚Äôt even say a word and just get up and leave because it‚Äôs too much. 

I have no idea what to do with this. I have an intake at a therapist next week for some mental health related issues, should I bring this up too? And does this happen to anyone else? I really don‚Äôt understand why this happens to me 

Thank you in advance for the help :)","I absolutely HATE yelling. Like really, really bad. I‚Äôm no sigmund freud but for me it‚Äôs definitely because I grew up in an incredibly shaky household. My family was always fighting, police coming in and out of my house, just overall not fun stuff. So I‚Äôm assuming that has something to do with it for me. Definitely bring this up with your therapist, perhaps they will be able to help that initial trigger, but regardless bringing up any trigger is only going to help you and your therapist work on a treatment plan.

I used to live in a decent sized city, and I found backroads in the country that takes me on a nice drive away from all of the light pollution and it‚Äôs nice to just be away from people and enjoy the country.

Anxiety,UPDATE: Today I had a job interview and I managed to go. No one seems to understand that for some people it's a tremendous struggle.,"As the original post got quite a lot of attraction I'll post an update.

Original post:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/gwfrjt/today\_i\_had\_a\_job\_interview\_and\_i\_managed\_to\_go/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/gwfrjt/today_i_had_a_job_interview_and_i_managed_to_go/) 

&#x200B;

Yesterday evening I got a call that they wanted me there today. I said sure, started prepping for the journey ( buses/trains are the most difficult part for me ). I ate all the right foods, slept enough, felt good. I took max dose of meds to ""guarantee"" success. 

Even with the meds and proper mindset, I was struggling at the second I left the house. Every step felt heavy, I wanted to turn back instantly. I made it to the first train then to the trainstation which had a bathroom. I had 45minutes to gather my thoughts before taking the next train to the destination.

I got on the train and things just got worse and worse and worse. Every passing stop I just wanted to jump out, crawl into a ball and cry. 2nd to last stop it became unbearable. I jumped off the train and took the next bus home. Mission failed.

I called my employer and was brutally honest about my situation. They seemed very understanding and offered to keep a 0hr contract indefinitely if I get my things together to a stage where I can reliably commute to work. So I made a good first impression and this guy seemed to appreciate honesty instead of me making up some bs lie about "" having some upper respetory symptoms "" or whatever which would've bought me some time. But I like honesty. I don't have to remember any lies and a lot of people appreciate it.

Even tho they were very kind and understandable, I feel like absolute shit right now. For past 7months my **only** goal was get a job, go there, do well. Be normal. Today even with medication I couldn't do that.

I haven't given up all hope yet and I'll start improving my diet even more and hopefully get to therapy asap. Apparently for people like me, sometimes the therapist meets half way if they know that leaving the house is difficult for the patient. Or even comes to your house. So that's great.

This was a major, major setback, but as my dad says "" You do everything you can, and that's all you can do "". I did everything. I prepared for everything. I had everything packed hours before leaving the house. I had a plan for when I get to work. But nope. Anxiety and panic disorder won this battle. Hopefully I'll win the war. 

And what gives a little extra twist to this: Traveling by car is fine. No problem whatsoever. But if I can't get to work, I can't afford a car. And if I can't take the bus, I can't get to work. Fml.",I'm proud of you! You went really far out of your comfort zone and even when a big challenge came up  you handled it!

Anxiety,My mother just told me that most people don‚Äôt over analyze and obsess over their mistakes made years ago? What is this witchcraft?,"So I showed her that meme of the girl lying in bed trying to sleep while her mind decides to suddenly replay her most embarrassing moments. And my mom said ‚Äúdoes that actually happen to you?‚Äù

And I just... does it not happen to most people? You mean to tell me that most of the world is just putting their mistakes in the past and moving on with their lives? What? How?? 

That sounds so emotionally healthy! Meanwhile multiple times a week I lie awake at night replaying the moments I most wish hadn‚Äôt happened.

Edit: Did not know this would resonate with people... also apparently this is a symptom of my OCD!","I wouldn't say it is unusual to do that every once and a while. Like once a month is probably pretty normal. If you spend almost every night doing this though, that is something to work on. It sounds like you struggle with embarrassment or fear of judgement. I used to be really bad about it, like if I said something that came across stupid or insensitive, I would apologize to that person, but I didn't forgive myself for it. I just replayed in my head how dumb it was. 

An old co-worker gave me the best advice about this. She said, no one is paying that much attention to you. It sounded mean at first but what she meant was, everyone else is so in their own head and worried about themselves that they probably will forget the dumb thing you said or did. 

It's like when you are nervous to give a speech in class. You are so afraid of messing up or everyone looking at you, but in reality, everyone else in the class is focused on being nervous themselves. 

Not sure if this is helpful, but maybe in time you won't be so critical of yourself.",1416,68,4/7/2020 15:17,fwm9rl
Anxiety,Does anyone else feel anger toward their parents for ‚Äúcausing‚Äù their anxiety disorder?,"As I have gotten older, I have started to realize that my parents(mostly my mom) have a lot to do with my anxiety. My mom has been all over me since i‚Äôve been a little kid. She shit talks everyone, always points out my flaws, and in general has tried to control my life. 

This has made me anxious, insecure, and have a low self esteem. I can usually circle back most of my anxiety back to how she has treated me over the years. Some of it came from bullying too of course.

My main point is that: does anyone else with a similar upbringing have any sort of anger toward their parents for some of the mental issues they might have caused? I am now almost 22 and I find myself upset with how my parents raised me. I am trying to pick up all the pieces and push myself in the right direction because in a lot of ways my parents failed. 




**Disclaimer**: let me say that I am not trying to pull a victim card here. I try my best to take responsibility for how I am and am doing my best to correct my issues. My parents have done A LOT for me over the years and I am grateful for that. I just have some internal rage built up.","I see what you‚Äôre saying. I have OCD and depression with the lovey bonus of panic attacks. There‚Äôs a lot of mental health history, on both sides of my family, and I tend to think that‚Äôs a large portion of my issues.

The other is absolutely how I was raised. My parents are great, but family dynamics and personalities clash and there was a lot of passive aggression, critique, pressure and too much responsibility put on me at a young age. There was also a lot of flux and change in my life (military family.) So while I don‚Äôt necessarily get angry at them, I can trace certain feelings or triggers I have back to consistent episodes in my family. And it annoys me and sometimes I resent that I was put in that situation.",1411,137,6/21/2020 13:49,hd78e8
Anxiety,I‚Äôm so worried about wasting my time that I wind up wasting my time,"It sucks. I‚Äôm sure all of us have these days where we have a whole list of goals we want to accomplish but our time anxiety gets the best of us. 

I‚Äôve tried doing the small goals approach, but I wind up feeling like I‚Äôm not doing enough. My lack of self motivation is so atrocious it‚Äôs a miracle I can wake up at normal times.

Have any of you had success combatting these issues? It sucks because I want to continue with my future but my complacency from anxiety and depression just wraps itself around me.","So I""m still working on this, and I don't have a solid solution yet, but I can try to share what's worked for me. 

It all comes down to harm reduction and countering shame. I've been working (with the help of my therapist) on positive self-talk and not falling into the trap of shaming myself for ""wasting time"" because shame is not a motivator. It just makes me feel worse and I go online to avoid the negative feelings and the spiral intensifies. 

I've instead been focusing on harm reduction. I can't just stop ""wasting time"" all at once, but I can get better at focusing on the task at hand. I can try to push myself a little bit more each time and then acknowledge that. So instead of the negative self-talk of ""oh no you wasted 30 minutes"" it could be ""you spent only 30 minutes on Reddit this time as opposed to 45 and then you got focused again. How can we make that time to focus shorter?"" I'm been working on using timers for work and for breaks and trying not to be angry at myself when I forget to set them or follow them. 

It all boils down to self-compassion. Be gentle with yourself. And remember one more important detail: internalized capitalism is the worst. You have value irrespective of what you accomplish. You are not worthless because you haven't produced what you want or feel like you need to produce. You are not a robot and you are going to have days when you feel really productive and days when you need to just curl up into a ball and wait for the day to go by. What's important is to be able to tell the difference between the two.",1413,35,8/25/2020 20:38,igkk32

Anxiety,I don't understand how people work 40+ hours a week for 45+ years of their lives,"I (23f) am American. I don't know if it is just me, but I am horrified by the thought of working all day every day until I can finally afford to retire (if that ever happens). My current job isn't hard, but it sucks the life out of me. Every weekend is too short, and every work week is too long. I never feel like I am rested enough or that I have enough time to do the fun things I like to do. I don't feel like I have hobbies anymore, and I certainly don't have very many friends. I feel like I have to spend all of my ""free time"" keeping my apartment together or resting to try and prepare for the following week.

I don't know how people do this for the majority of their lives, and I especially don't know how people manage to do this while also raising children. I think of all the things I want out of life, including children, traveling, homeownership, and everything else that comes with that, and I don't see how it is possible for those things to happen working full time. I don't even make enough money to do those things, much less have the vacation time. I'm working on budgeting and building my savings, but the math never seems to work out in a way that feels comfortable. I promised myself I would see Europe before I hit 25 and I don't think that's a realistic goal anymore.

I get stuck in this spiral of ""am I just lazy"" and start to get worried that it is only me. Maybe, somehow, I am the only adult who cannot handle working full time and isn't happy about this being my life for the next 45 years. Sometimes I feel ungrateful. My life is fine - I have a roof over my head and food to eat. I am privileged in terms of the type I work I do. Sure, it is mind numbing and often anxiety-inducing, but it is a job that pays enough for me to stay alive. That's better than a lot of people can say. 

Can someone tell me it isn't just me? Or maybe give me a reality check that it is? I just don't know how I can keep this up for another 45 years. I'm so tired.

Edit: I've taken some time to go through all the comments (though I didn't expect so many) and have really appreciated a lot of the advice i've been given! It's great to feel not as alone in this discomfort, and I think I have some ideas and goals on how to improve my situation in this new year. Thank you all so much.","Nope, not just you.

Later on in high school I told myself that teachers could not do shit if you don‚Äôt know the answer when they call you out. Once I realized that, I had no problem saying ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù. At worst I just shook my head ‚Äúno‚Äù when they asked me and they knew right away.

Anxiety,I WENT TO A PARK BY MYSELF,"I‚Äôm a 26 y/o and for the first time since high school I was able to go for a walk at a public park by myself! 

Last December I tried to take my life because of my social anxiety and depression. 10 months later I was able to conquer my fears! 

I took advice from a friend as my anxiety was starting to feel uncontrollable. I started to drive to the park every morning, but couldn't get out of the car. I continued driving there every morning to attempt to make myself more comfortable with my surroundings. The morning I got out of the car I was feeling scared stepping out of the car, but as I started walking a sense of pride came over myself. I was so happy I made it this far that I continued to walk and walk and walk and got to experience a joy in myself that was long overdue!

I started to get into a routine, journaling (writing three things I love about myself, + and - things that happened throughout the day, three short term goals I want to accomplish), walking, meditating, etc. I‚Äôm just so darn proud of myself! 

One baby step at a time!

People who don't have anxiety are panicking, so what the hell do you think those with anxiety will behave like?

It's not worth it. I haven't watched the news in 2 days and I've now put several subreddits on block. Honestly my anxiety is WAY less! It really does make a difference.","Amen to that. I keep my focus local, so I know what I'm supposed to be doing in my city/surrounding region.

Anxiety,"Anyone else have ""functioning"" panic attacks where you feel awful, but can otherwise appear totally fine to others?","Apologies in advance for the long post. This is something I've been struggling with for a while, so I'm hoping that by sharing my experience, maybe I can finally legitimize what I've been going through. 

I have been having what I now know to be panic attacks since I was very young. Over the past few years, they have been getting worse and more frequent, and most often crop up when I'm out of the house (especially when I'm at work.) For a long time, I actually wasn't sure that they *were* panic attacks, because my doctors/therapists always described something very different from what I experienced.

Contrary to what I was told by my doctors, I often find that I can function (or at least appear to) perfectly well during a panic attack. My heart is racing, my hands are shaking, my chest feels tight, I feel like my knees will give out with every step I take... and yet I can take a phone call at my desk and sound totally calm and professional. I can greet clients and smile and make small talk, and no one around me can tell that something's wrong. (It's almost like I do these things on autopilot, because later, I find that I usually can't remember much of what happened or what was said.) Afterward, when I don't have to put on my ""brave face"" anymore, I feel physically and emotionally exhausted; the shaking and chills take a long time to subside, and I sometimes cry uncontrollably at trivial things. 

I suppose I should add that a lot of my anxiety rests in not wanting people to be mad at me, or not wanting to let people down. Even when I'm feeling really anxious or depressed, I have trouble asking for the time/space I need to take care of myself because I don't want to upset anyone or make them think I'm incompetent. So, I guess it makes sense that even when a panic attack comes on, I still feel compelled to push those feelings down and force myself to appear ""normal.""

I am pretty wary of speaking to doctors/therapists about these types of attacks, because on more than one occasion, I have been told that I'm totally wrong and they absolutely **cannot** be panic attacks, because if they were, I'd be hyperventilating and I wouldn't be able to control them so well. I feel like they think I'm just being overdramatic and looking for attention. Sometimes it really gets to me, and I start to worry that maybe I *am* just being dramatic and I don't ""deserve"" to call them that because there's nothing wrong with me. It's to the point where even if I'm with someone I trust (i.e. my husband or my mom) I usually don't tell them if an attack comes on because I feel like if I did, they wouldn't believe me; from the outside, I'd appear to be perfectly fine. 

Has anyone else ever experienced anything like this? I feel really alone, so I came to you, people of Reddit, hoping that you can help me find some closure.


EDIT:

Thank you all for your support, advice, and kind words. When I posted this I never imagined it would get this much attention. It‚Äôs so wonderfully comforting to know that I‚Äôm not the only one going through this.","Sounds more like an anxiety attack (which is different than a panic attack). When I'm having a panic attack, I can't really function well and you can tell I'm panicing, but when I'm having an anxiety attack, I can seem like I'm still functioning while I'm freaking out on the inside.",1331,69,5/19/2020 1:33,gmezo7

Anxiety,Does anyone ever feel like they are extremely lonely but are also the one isolating yourself? (Ex: not going outside your house for days but also declining any offers to go out?),"Hi. I‚Äôve struggled with this on and off since I was a young teen. I grew up in the suburbs with immigrant parents and one older sibling who was always out with huge groups of friends or gfs and never home. My parents never ever went out (socializing felt like a burden to them, didnt have too many friends, couldn‚Äôt spend too much money) holidays were just another day at home, never anything special. it wasn‚Äôt until the last decade now that all kids are grown and they‚Äôre retired that they started traveling the world and taking up hobbies and making friends. When I was a kid and I complained about feeling cooped up at home, they couldn‚Äôt relate to my anxiety. I always felt like my close friends always had ‚Äúother groups‚Äù of friends or huge families where there was never a weekend or day they‚Äôd be home moping. always had groups of friends besides our core friend group, so on random occasions where every person was occupied, it always hit me how extremely lonely I feel.

now, as an adult it still hits me here and there. Everyone knows I‚Äôm an extreme introvert and love being home. but lately I‚Äôll be home for 3-4 days straight, can‚Äôt bring myself to leave my 1000sq ft apt I live alone in to get the mail, take out trash, or drive to run errands as my simple ‚Äúsocialization for the day.‚Äù I have a bunch of things I could be doing outside, errand-wise, or at home (chore-wise, ex: decluttering closets, getting some freelance projects done, job hunting, etc.) but instead I can‚Äôt bring myself to do any of them and fixate on my loneliness. 

I let the dishes pile up, eat junk food/instant ramen, just waste hours on YouTube or the internet, sit around crying for no reason, and when people text me to hang out I decline. I don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs going on with me, it‚Äôs like I‚Äôve reached such a level of being a slob that I can‚Äôt bring myself to get ready in 20 min to go outside and hang. My family will even ask to have dinner or something, and the thought of having to coordinate 3 different parties and choose a restaurant and think about 5 hours of productivity I won‚Äôt get back (though let‚Äôs be real, I won‚Äôt be doing anything productive) gives me extreme anxiety.

I‚Äôm torn between wanting to bask in solitude and being miserable being so lonely. Can anyone at all relate or is this an issue specific to me since childhood? Am I just a lazy POS and that‚Äôs my problem?","Very much struggling with this now. I spend all day at home studying, but when I get invited out, I just think about how nice it would be to stay home.

25% of people won‚Äôt like you but something you do could make them like you.

You can‚Äôt really tell who is who in most cases and you have no control over who they are and how they react to you.

So it doesn‚Äôt make sense to try and figure it out or try to control it, just let it go. Someone‚Äôs reaction or perception of you is not your fault, just do your best and don‚Äôt let yourself get caught up using your imagination to guess what people are thinking about you.

Let me repeat the last part.

Don‚Äôt waste time and energy worrying about or assuming you know what anyone is thinking about you, using your imagination is most likely not accurate at all and especially if you have anxiety it can‚Äôt be trusted anyways.

You don‚Äôt need to respond to anything immediately, you don‚Äôt need to go out of your way to make sure someone doesn‚Äôt think the wrong thing in the majority of situations. It just doesn‚Äôt matter and it‚Äôs OK for people to be wrong!

So I think about/plan for the short term. I kind of force myself to ""comfortably"" think about tomorrow on a small scale. Like what I might eat for breakfast, what outfit I might wear, what I'll be working on at work.

Anxiety,Anyone else panic when someone near them is angry or possibly angry?,"I notice that when someone in the same space as me is angry or shows signs of anger, I become extremely on edge. I start to shake, I get the urge to cry or run/hide and I go completely mute, unable to look that person in the eye or talk to them, kind of in fear of getting in their way and having them take it out on me (though not always). Something as small as that person sighing really loudly, or someone slamming or dropping something sends me into a panic. It takes me a really long time to calm down too. I assume this is from my social anxiety? But I haven‚Äôt heard of this in anyone else with social anxiety. I keep googling it but each time I end up with nothing, so I decided to ask/post here.

Anxiety,Finally passed my driver's test at 25!!!,"I was so nervous that my foot was shaking on the gas pedal. I almost chickened out and didn't even go today, but I'm glad I did!

Edit: You guys are the best! I don't have a lot of people to share the news with and you guys have been great! Thank you so much for all the kind words, congratulations, and the awards. This has really made my day.

To those of you who are in the same situation I was in, just practice as much as you can and make yourself do it! You could even do a mock test with the person teaching you to drive. Just go to the place where you plan to take the test and drive exactly like you would during the test. You can have your teacher tell you where to go and end it with parallel parking somewhere. It will make you less nervous during the real test if you feel like you've done it before. Plus, you won't be taken surprise by driving in an unfamiliar area. 

Be sure to know where everything is in the car you are going to be taking, they ask you to turn on emergency flashers, point out the parking break, turn signals, wipers, etc. This is all dependant on where you live, but it couldn't hurt to know of course. 

And my last tip, be sure to pay attention to road signs. Two different times during the test, the lady pointed out signs we had just passed and asked me what they were/what they said. It's easy to forget or miss signs that aren't that important to you, but pay attention during the test at least!",YAY!,1230,62,2/11/2020 20:35,f2ej20
Anxiety,"Whatever you do, don‚Äôt believe the thoughts your anxious mind brings","I‚Äôm probably gonna delete this post later cuz of my anxiety but just wanted to give a reminder to you guys.

When your anxious, your mind thinks the worst possible scenario, not the most REALISTIC scenario. The worst possible scenario could have a <1% chance of being true but it doesn‚Äôt feel like that in the state of anxiousness.

It‚Äôs a trap, it feels like you‚Äôre gonna be stuck like this forever, which inevitably gives you more anxiety and now you‚Äôre stuck in a loop.

Its easier said than done but learning to accept that the worst case scenario can happen seems to be the best way to deal with anxiety.

Again, you‚Äôre thinking about the most unlikely, worst case scenario. No, you‚Äôre not going to go crazy, you aren‚Äôt gonna have a heart attack, your life isn‚Äôt ruined forever, you‚Äôre intrusive thoughts won‚Äôt clog your mind forever.

Any tips on how to shake this feeling off?","I relate to this so much, I‚Äôve internalized even the smallest critique for years and hold onto it, it‚Äôs an awful thing 

This might sound a little wishy-washy but I‚Äôve found writing daily affirmations has started to help me accept my imperfections, ones I write regarding this issue are: ‚ÄòI am not my mistakes‚Äô ‚ÄòIn every struggle lies a learning experience‚Äô and ‚ÄòI forgive myself‚Äô. Sounds silly but the more I write them out and say them it tricks my brain into believing it more.

Also doing something I‚Äôm bad at (for me, starting ballet again) has been helpful in that case bc I make a LOT of mistakes and get critiqued by my teacher, but it‚Äôs been pushing me to accept that I will never be perfect, and criticism is inevitable, but if I do my best i will be proud of myself. 

Not sure if any of this is helpful, I think it‚Äôs about sitting with yourself and working out what exercises  you can give yourself to challenge that particular anxiety. Good luck and remember none of us will ever be perfect, and growth is a good thing!",1218,34,5/26/2020 10:12,gquc6o

Anxiety,I was the only student to join the video chat this morning.,"Since we transitioned to online classes, my Spanish professor still wanted to meet with us so we could continue to practice speaking Spanish. When we first started doing this, I wondered what would happen if only one person showed up, and now I know. 

This morning, I was the only student that joined the call for the majority of the session. Another student joined about 10 minutes before the call was supposed to end. It didn't make me panic as much as I thought it would, but I did kinda panic a little bit whenever it took me too long to answer some of the activities.

I did get the chance to have a little bit of a one on one lesson to practice using words in the past tense. We have an Oral Interview coming up soon and I needed the practice because I will have to talk in the past tense. 

It also made me feel a little better about making mistakes (learning a second language is very hard). My professor was very patient when I took a little bit longer to answer some of the questions and was helpful when I couldn't remember some words. It made me feel a little more confident and if I stay focused, I think I'll be able to get a lot of my schoolwork done today.

Anxiety,I've learned that one of the best ways to overcome anxiety is to listen and take care of your body. It is the only boss.,"I'm 25F and I have anxiety. Obsessive and intrusive thoughts. Panic. Paranoia. Constant worry. Incapacity of joy and calmness. All this in a loop. All of this makes me forget about my body. So it accumulates a huge amount of stress.

When my body is relaxed, my mind follows it.

I always forget about this. Always. And if I remember I don't do anything about it because I'm too busy worrying about shit.

Take a deep, really deep deep breath. Hold it. Let it go.

Dance.

Take warm or cool baths.

Comb your hair.

Drink lots of water.

Stretch.

Take sunbathes.

Hydrate your skin.

Put your feet on scented water.

Run.

Ride a bicycle.

Cry.

Walk on the rain.

Get a massage.

Feel the wind on your face.

Get a sweet hug from a loved one.



Your mind will follow.","It is so hard to remember this when you are stuck in such a dark place so thank you for the reminder and hope everyone's hanging in there, we got this!",1199,33,12/5/2020 0:36,k6xeog

You are going to make it through this even if you feel like you aren't.  No matter how alone you feel, its just that, a feeling, in reality you have us all with you. This is not a journey you are taking by yourself.

Crying is not weakness, its emotion. Its empathy and you are blessed to have it in the times in which we live. Its a resource even more precious  than platinum.  We aren't broken, its the world around us that is. We just see it for what it is and care enough for those whom are cold.

Stop being so hard on yourself, you are exactly who you need to be. Don't let a day go by without telling those around you that you love them and learn to accept love from others even if you feel like you don't deserve it. You do, we all do.

One race, the human race. One love.

Anxiety,"Does anyone else feel like, they annoy everyone.","Every interaction i have, is unconfortable for me. I feel like, if i text someone, im taking their time, annoying them. If i speak to someone, my voice annoys them. So i shut up. But is it worth it?
Anyone else feels like this?","I‚Äôve felt like that for all of high school. Truth is: if you really were annoying, people would tell you, believe me. Or people would avoid you and would not speak to you. 
I used to think like that because I was extremely self conscious due to being bullied for years. I thought no one would like me and I was a burden. 
But I wasn‚Äôt. And I‚Äôm pretty sure you aren‚Äôt as well. 
Ask people you trust about this. It‚Äôs scary, but it helps. Ask them if your voice sounds weird and tell them how you feel about wasting their time. I‚Äôm sure their answers will calm you down and make you more confident. You can use this to work on yourself and get better. 
I for myself can say that I don‚Äôt think you are annoying and you did not waste my time by asking this.

Anxiety,Anyone else anxious about having to go back to ‚Äònormal‚Äô eventually?,"I feel so selfish for this because I‚Äôve been lucky enough to be able to WFH and quarantine this entire time. 

At the beginning of shelter in place, I was too anxious to even be outside.

I can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm using COVID as an excuse to socially isolate myself or if I‚Äôm genuinely still terrified of catching it/passing it, but I really love my new routine. 

I get to work on my own time without the awkward office chatter, don‚Äôt have to spend all day on campus being overly self-aware, I don‚Äôt feel obligated to attend social events, it‚Äôs honestly amazing. I‚Äôve gotten to work more on meditation & other anxiety coping strategies. I feel so awful for the way I feel because this has been such a difficult & stressful time for so many people.","I can't think of going back to normal life(pre covid life). I feel so chill nowadays and feels like in the shell of my comfort zone. I don't need to travel daily, I don't need to push myself to have a conversation with someone. No awkward social interactions.

Anxiety,I did it! I asked for a girls number today.,"I'm a junior in college, and I've never dated or even kissed a girl because of my Social Anxiety Disorder holding me back. I was officially diagnosed at the age of 15, and whenever I tried to date, I could never go through with it. I would seldom try to talk to girls about dating seriously, and when I did, I usually canceled or just chickened out.

But today I was feeling good, I think I had done pretty well at an Exam I was studying all week for, and it was almost the weekend.  I was in the class we're in and kept sneaking glances at her. The feeling in my gut surged when I thought about asking for her phone number. I keep thinking of reasons why I shouldn't, even though I know I wanted to. I finally just told my self ""Screw it, I'm doing it"" and threw caution to the wind, ignoring the feeling in my gut.

I asked her after class was over, and she had me give her my number and texted me afterwards. Idk if anything will come of it, but this felt like a huge milestone for me!

UPDATE: I texted her some, but she seldom replied, and even when she did, she didn't very interested. I don't think anything will come out of this, but this was a huge milestone for me and I'm proud of myself nonetheless!",Anxious dude here.

‚ÄúMom, please take this down. As I said in person I would really prefer it and strongly ask that you dont talk about my mental health or my issues on your Facebook with people whom I don‚Äôt know. I love you, and no offense to anyone who‚Äôs read this post, but this information is private about me and I do not like that it has been shared without my consent.

You are right, your mental health is yours and shouldn't appear on Internet without your consent.

I don't know in your country but in mine, your boss don't have the right to know why you're ill when you don't come at work because of privacy. So, if your job (where you pass the most of your time) don't have the right to know, I think your mom's friends don't need to know either. 

And there is a difference between telling that at some of her friends when she meet them or call them and post it on Facebook where a lot of people (and maybe not ""friends"") can see that.

Anxiety,Does anyone else feel like they're constantly in a rush to get things done even when they have nothing else they want to do?,"I don't know if this is anxiety linked or not but Ive always has this sense to rush things.

Like I want to move on to the next thing or I just want to finish things so I can relax.

But then when I have nothing to do I don't have anything I even want to do. I feel like it's really hard for me to just enjoy what I'm doing whether it's good or bad, work or fun, etc. 

I've read of ""Hurry Sickness"" but it feels like that matches people that are actually busy and want to do more things. Im not really a busy person, it's like I'm in a rush to get back to doing nothing.","Yes, this used to be me! I feel like it‚Äôs part of anxiety. I used to create never ending lists of things, or make things into bigger jobs than they were, so I could feel busy, but in control. It could be an adrenaline thing, and it also could be the sense that if you didn‚Äôt do it as fast as you could something bad might happen.

I used to be fine going to shows, concerts, anything. I liked it.  
But ever since my first ever panic attack I've been physically ""shaky"", even sometimes when I am not even mentally worried at the time.  
It's like my body turned into a chicken.

Now when I attend an event, I sometimes feel stress symptoms.  
Then after the high excitement/stress event, I sometimes get a ""hangover"" period. I feel so exhausted and sometimes hungry.  


This is when the heart palpitations sometimes kick in. I feel my wrist and it's sometimes about every 5th beat, and sometimes about every 20th beat. These heart palpitations give my chest a weird, uneasy feeling. There's this vague but strong discomfort in chest area, to the point where the thought of going to the ER crosses the mind.

Then I go to bed, get lots of sleep, and wake up still tired when slight anxiety-like tremors the next day. But then as that day progresses, it starts to feel a little better.

Does anyone's body feel ""shaken"" after high excitement/stress events where it takes a while to recover?","Yes. I feel like I am drunk or hungover. My brain feels like mush. So I used that time to try and just experience, if that makes sense. Just lay in bed and feel- the bed, my clothes, etc. I essentially reset my brain and have a numbness. Breathing normally and shit

I‚Äôve become so used to how we‚Äôre living now that it sometimes trips me out to see people without masks on TV. I hate that going to the grocery store gives me intense anxiety now and that Wal-Mart feels like a goddamn battle zone for me lmao. I hate how paranoid and helpless I‚Äôve been feeling. I hate that I‚Äôm afraid to leave my house and fear every time my loved ones do too. I hate that my boyfriend and I feel like we‚Äôre in a long distance relationship when he‚Äôs only 40 minutes away haha. I hate that I can‚Äôt hold my baby cousin and see his chubby lil face. I hate that I can barely see my loved ones outside of the house and I worry about them every day. I hate that I have to plan how I can do basic things like going to the post office or going to work just to minimize exposure. I hate that the government where I live is basically useless in keeping us safe and they just keep prioritizing money over our health. I hate that almost no one in Hawai‚Äôi (where I live) is taking it seriously anymore, tourists are still coming in, and our numbers are literally tripling by the day. 

My OCD and anxiety has kicked into an intense high gear ever since this happened and it‚Äôs so emotionally draining. And it doesn‚Äôt help that every extreme precaution I take for my parents sake, they don‚Äôt follow. Whenever I get home from work or the store, it‚Äôs like a 30 minute process of sanitizing all my belongings that I brought, showering, washing my clothes, and cleaning my hands a million times. But my family doesn‚Äôt do the same so I‚Äôm worried that it‚Äôs all for nothing. We‚Äôve luckily been ok for the most part and I feel privileged to be able to say that. I feel a little silly complaining, but as a house full of essential workers (aside from my dad who got fired from his job at the beginning of COVID after 19 years) I‚Äôm just constantly on edge. I just wanna protect all my loved ones and I feel like I can‚Äôt. And I know I can‚Äôt. I just wish I could.

The things some people don‚Äôt understand about the people who commit suicide/think about suicide, is that we do not want to die.

I wonder if there's any harm in playing sounds all day long. I don't play it loud but maybe the constant stimulation has a negative effect on the brain. Either way, I can't stop now, I just get way too anxious without anything in the background and I prefer a show with people talking to a white noise machine.

So, anyone do that too? What shows do you watch? I usually just rewatch shows old favorites, and I leave new shows for when I actually want to pay attention. I've been playing Friends and Brooklyn 99 a lot recently.

Edit: This got so many replies! I appreciate everyone who took the time to comment. Pretty awesome that all of us here have the same experience, makes me feel less like a weirdo because my ex used to always be amazed how I can just rewatch the same show over and over for weeks. She accepted shows playing 24/7 but she didn't get it like y'all do :)",I do this when I go to sleep cause I start thinking too much before bed. I always do a live stream cause the thought of being unconscious for hours is a weird one for me so I like to know things are still going on while I sleep idk lmao,1114,149,5/8/2020 23:25,gg45u4

Anxiety,"If haven‚Äôt already done so: try abstaining from caffeine. Many people don‚Äôt react to caffeine well but don‚Äôt make the connection that it‚Äôs what‚Äôs causing them a great deal of anxiety, myself included. 2 weeks after stopping caffeine, my anxiety has diminished greatly.",,"This is a great PSA.

I wish it was stickied in the sidebar.

A few other small things that can greatly reduce anxiety.

1. Quit/greatly reduce alcohol usage
2. Quit/greatly reduce caffeine
3. Regular exercise (I prefer to go for 1-2mile walks)
4. Nature (go for a walk at a local park, boom just knocked out two of the big helpers. Also my dog loves me)
5. diet control (losing weight, gaining weight, or just bing control. It's quite helpful.)
6. Reduce social-media usage.
7. get a little more in person-social (studies show, that even for those suffering from social anxiety that social exposure is key. Though you should always work with your therapist as situations are different) I just try to talk more with my wife, builds up our relationship and help me be more social/not withdrawn. It's also small things, like saying hi or good morning to strangers as I walk my dog.
8. Reflection/meditation (I use an app called ""my life"" but any app or method that works on being grateful, meditation, or journaling/reflection would be highly recommended. This is coming from someone who strongly dislikes doing all this stuff. But it helps.)
9. Healthy sleeping habits. 

Small actions, add up over time.

Anxiety,"Feels like I am constantly bracing for the next ""bad thing"" to happen to me.","Title pretty much sums it up. I feel like I can never relax, never live fully or happily, because I am simply constantly mentally preparing myself for whatever next bad thing will happen to me. For example, I finally met this pretty great person, we had a great time, and yet somehow, even when I was most happy with them, I was mentally preparing myself for the inevitable fact that it would fall apart (and it did, but, granted, that was because of lockdowns and stuff).

Health worries are also pretty prominent. Whenever I'm pretty healthy, I can never enjoy it, because I frankly am just getting ready and thinking about what next health woe will be thrown my way and how I will be miserable because of it. Even now, I have a problem where I literally can not stop thinking about worst case scenarios, regardless of likelihood. I have done everything I can -- called my specialist, set up an appointment, and will receive the next step in treatment, and I have refilled my current medication to treat it. And yet, here I am, worrying obsessively about infection or something -- despite me having this problem for three years and my worst case scenario not coming true. (\*\*knock on wood\*\*).

I can't relax. I can't stop bracing for the next bad/uncomfortable thing to happen, and even when I am doing everything I possibly can, I don't feel good enough to live my life. I am tired and miserable. I know I need a therapist, but office closures make it tough to do so, especially as I want to see one in person.

EDIT: Wow, I really had no idea this post would take off the way it did. It's funny that I used my throwaway account, for discussing some of the issues that I'm most embarrassed about, and am getting some of the best responses and best advice on.

Anxiety,Corona killed my anxiety,"Basically,  having to work from home and not go out to socialise has given my mind and body a much needed break.  

Working from home means that I don't have a lot of the job related anxiety that makes me dread Sundays and Mondays. I am also able to save on the 2 hours of commute and so I have a lot more free time.  

Not having to wake up early means I get 8 plus hours of sleep every night. I didn't realise how much lack of sleep was affecting my mood.  

Not having to go out means I no longer need to worry about my IBS related stomach problems. I also no longer feel pressured to socialise (im an introvert by nature and love staying at home and playing games / watching tv). 

With all the time I have, I finally feel like I am no longer running behind the ball, and have the time to reset, rest and do the things I love, without judgement. 

It just feels like the wonderful break ive always dreamt of but never thought possible.  

Appreciate that this is a hard time for most and dont deny what people are going through.

Anxiety,I (F17) told my dad about my anxiety and got unexpected reaction,"Posted it on r/relationship but got removed. The mods told me to post here instead.




English is not my first language so please neglect any mistakes. I've always suffered from mild depression and social anxiety. I'm sure my parents know of it because of my mental breakdowns and also because my dad is a doctor himself. I love my parents but they are just too busy with their life and profession. They're hardly even home. They've remained uninvolved in most of life.


So this happened a few weeks back. I was really troubled because of school, couldn't sleep and was having a meltdown. I don't know what came over me but I went ahead and woke my dad. I asked him to come to the living room while sobbing. As soon as we sat on the couch, I poured my heart out to him. He didn't say anything. Except a few ""hmm""s and nods. Lastly he calmly asked me if I would like to meet a friend of his ( he didn't directly say a therapist ). He then went ahead to tell me that my illness is valid and seeking help won't deem me as ""crazy"". I refused and went to sleep.

The next morning as usual my parents were not home but my lil brother (M13) was there. He asked me if I had talked to Dad about something. I acted confused. He then started crying and telling me that I should have told him if I was suffering so much. I calmed him down (which took quite a while) and afterwards he told me that mom and dad were talking about me. Dad told mum to make sure that the environment of our home was a happy place for me and they were planning to make time for me/family by taking some time off. 

I've never ever felt such love from any thing or person. I'm so so blessed. I'm just so thankful for my family. I feel like I can endure anything. I just wish I would have leaned on my family for support earlier. Please everyone if you're suffering, reach out to your loved ones. It can make a world of difference, I promise!



tl;dr - reached out to my dad and got unexpected support and love from family ‚ù§Ô∏è

Anxiety,I fell asleep on the couch with the backdoor slightly open and woke up to two strangers in my living room.,"We have a cat that likes to sit outside and watch out over our garden. For this reason we often leave the backdoor slightly open, one of those glass sliding doors, until we go to bed and call him inside.

A few days ago we both fell asleep on the couch watching a movie. Sometime during the night I woke up and I saw my partner (I assumed) doing something in the TV cabinet that was really strange. I couldn‚Äôt think of anything he would be doing there in the middle of the night and the TV cabinet was also moved away from the wall. So I asked what he was doing. It was dark so I couldn‚Äôt see him well and I was still half asleep. He moved his finger to his lips as to say be quiet and walked to the hall. Then I heard whispers and I started to realize something wasn‚Äôt right and at that moment I noticed my boyfriend was still lying next to me on the couch. 

It‚Äôs so fucked up. I can‚Äôt describe the level of shock I felt in that instant. I woke up my partner who immediately was up when I said there were strangers inside our home. They ran out of the front door with all the electronics that were in our living room. My phone, macbook, playstation, etc. They were actually trying to steal the cables as well which was why the TV cabinet was moved. My partner ran after them and managed to get some things back they dropped outside. He ran back inside, dropped those things on our kitchen cabinet, put on shoes, and went back outside searching for them. 

The rest of the events are so weird. I was still trying to get pants on which was very hard in that moment as I felt I was going to pass out. When I finally managed to get my pants and shoes on I went outside but couldn‚Äôt see my partner anymore. I didn‚Äôt have my phone and did not know what to do. As minutes passed I was scared that something might have happened to him as it was two against one and you don‚Äôt know what those other people are like. I took the car and drove to my brother who lives really close by. Woke him up and asked him to call S, my partner, who at that moment just arrived back at our home.

It turns out he was able to follow them because they stole one of our electric steps and one of them was driving it. It has a red backlight (that you can turn off but they did not seem to be aware of this), and he was able to see them from a long distance. He followed them to a parking lot while calling the police. When they noticed he was following them they did something weird and went up to the second deck of the parking lot which has no other exit. My partner blocked the one exit but kept at a distance. Police arrived before they made a move and both were arrested.

After the initial shock I felt pretty good about the situation. I was calm. Relieved my partner was okay. Even enjoying the weird outcome with them getting arrested, especially as later turned out we weren‚Äôt the first house they had broke in to. 

But now some negative thoughts are creeping in and I‚Äôve started feeling stressed about it. I think back a lot to the moment when I just woke up and saw him sitting so close to me and the confusion I felt and later the realization of what was going on. Of how I was not able to respond in the moment. How my partner went after them and of what could have happened to him. Of what might happen if they come back or want to spite us for getting them arrested. Or our house gets broken into again. It sucks. I know not all these fears are rational but some are and I have trouble relaxing. Some wise words for me friends?

Edit: Typing this out and waking up to your replies and advise has been really nice. Thank you everyone. I‚Äôll try to respond to you all later today.","Hey, I don't have some wise words, but I want to say I'm sorry this happened.  That feels scary and violating.  I'm really glad you and your partner are not hurt and the perpetrators were arrested.   

I've been burglarized twice and robbed once (I was once burglarized because I frequently left my door slightly cracked for my cat!).  It's scary, and there's no way around that.  

Overall, it sounds like the situation went really well.  I would probably need to address my fears with a therapist, but please know that from what you wrote you reacted well -- in that in the end, no one got hurt.  I am sorry that you felt the very real fear when your parter went after them.  I may have felt more comfortable letting the stuff go than going after the culprits, which was riskier.  

This may be silly to say, but I didn't get burglarized again once I kept my door closed.  Also, generally, generally, generally speaking, burglars are often opportunists and do not want to actually hurt people.  

Take care of yourself!  Do something you enjoy today - spend time with your partner if you can.",1033,41,9/13/2020 21:13,is6wza

I feel like a nuisance and burden to everyone around me. Lately all I want is to just be in a coma and be free from all the self doubt and feelings of being unworthy of even existing. 

The one ounce of reassurance I‚Äôve learned is that everyone is too caught up in their own shit to even give more than a passing thought to you. We convince ourselves that whatever we did or said is end all be all but the truth is it was just a passing moment for most and they‚Äôre back to focusing on whatever they‚Äôve got to get through that day.

You need therapy to fix your thought process, and that decreases or even eliminates anxiety If you have really bad anxiety, medication will help you cope. But it's not the solution because your bad thought process is still there. Meds are good to get your symptoms in control.

You need therapy in all cases of anxiety. 

You do not always need meds. Meds are for those people who are having a harder time coping with their symptoms

Anxiety,Does anyone else avoid the news these days?,"Hi, all. Is anyone else having to almost completely avoid the news right now? I almost feel like it's ""attacking"" me when I listen to it or watch it, ramping up my anxiety levels & frankly making me feel almost paranoid. I'm having to stay off Twitter entirely, and off FB as much as possible. It's all so awful most of the time, and there's nothing I can do about it. I feel a bit guilty sometimes, thinking that as an adult I've got a duty to keep up with the news, and also, as a Christian, I ought to be aware of what's going on in the world so I can at least pray for it. I have trouble even talking about certain subjects now, because it can set me down deep, dark rabbit holes and trigger a depressive episode. And, although I feel really lonely and isolated, I still need to be careful what I expose myself to - for example, a friend of mine keeps pushing really scary conspiracy theories which does my head in. I don't mind talking to her about almost anything else, but not that, as once I've spiralled down, it can be days before I haul myself up again!

I was trying to explain to my mother that I've got really burned out and feel hypersensitive. I'm not proud of myself for it, as I'm sure I'm not being very mature, but there's only so much fearmongering a person can take, and like many people (I suspect), I've been fearmongered half to death over the past few months.

These days, we're all connected 24/7 and there's almost no hiding from anything. We ""have"" to think about Covid all day, every day - we're not being allowed to put it out of our minds for even one second. When I was growing up, we had news programmes, of course, and newspapers, but somehow, it wasn't in our faces all the time & we could take a break from it. Also, the media seems to have been more trustworthy back then, even if it wasn't - at least, there wasn't all this fear of ""fake news"". Part of my problem these days is the feeling that i can't even trust what I read any more.

So I try to focus on other things: watching TV shows, knitting (I'm making soft toys to give to people to cheer them up a bit!), listening to audio books and podcasts, learning Irish on Duolingo and also praying, as I find that a comfort. It's hard though!

How lonely you feel during it. We all experience it on our own and even if someone is next to you, they still don‚Äòt feel the same fear as you do in that moment.

The way I‚Äòm shaking right now because I am so scared, no one is here and awake. I‚Äòm crying and even if they were awake they couldn‚Äòt help me because the fear is deeply rooted inside of me.

For example, you can search things like ""Rain city background"" or ""medieval town ambiance"" or ""crackling fireplace and rain background"", a lot of YouTubers have uploaded thousands of videos that you can just leave playing in the background.

I‚Äôm glad we have this platform to connect and write how we feel without judgement. You are not alone. I‚Äôm going to list a few things that help me and I hope you can try. 

1. Peppermint oil. (Roller ball form sold at target for 4.99) put it directly on temples, neck wrist. I love to roll on tissue and smell. The scent really does soothe and calms me down. I can‚Äôt be without. 

2. Finding a game on your phone or YouTube videos on something you like that can distract you. Have a list of saved videos you can watch when you are feeling a panic. 

3. Ice pack. I put one on my neck or just hold it the sensation helps to calm. 

4. Staying hydrated. Drinking cold water when I‚Äôm feeling anxious also helps a little. 

5. Fresh air. If I‚Äôm too anxious for a walk I will sit on my balcony, and listen to music/ play a distracting game on my phone.

6. Creating a list of things you need to do. Example cleaning or organizing a closet or drawer etc to keep busy. Even simply washing the Dishes.",940,58,6/6/2020 4:51,gxkn4w

Some days I feel supercharged and extra supportive of my friends who are struggling and don‚Äôt respond to texts, video calls, online game sessions, invitations to virtually hang out, not being invited to virtual gatherings between friends, etc. I‚Äôm like ‚ÄúI get it, that‚Äôs ok, I understand because I know what depression is like...‚Äù

but then my (well-established) struggle with loneliness and rejection = lack of value and self-worth makes me really angry offended, then sad because I feel ‚Äúgod I must be so terrible, that‚Äôs why people would rather not communicate with me and instead communicate with others‚Äù 

Then I reach out or try to communicate my situation gently, (even asking honestly AITA). the response is more like ‚ÄúHmm tbh I haven‚Äôt really been putting effort into doing things or seeing people.

Anxiety,"Does anybody else feel tightness in the chest and sinking feeling every morning before an ""event""...ANY event?","Tl:dr: Am I weird for waking up with a sinking feeling in my gut on my birthday? Or is this what excitement is?

Today is my birthday. I am not big on birthdays, I don't like to celebrate it and in my opinion, this day has nothing to be celebrated about, being born was neither my choice nor my accomplishment.

Anyway, I woke up this morning at around 4 am, which is not my normal time of waking up, and I had this tight feeling in my stomach and this sinking feeling in my gut like something bad was gonna happen, I don't know how to describe it.
I am not new to this feeling, I have had it for years, before every flight I had to take, no matter what time of day, before any meeting early in the morning (even if it is a casual meeting where nothing is at stake), even so much as if I had planned to do anything in the morning, I would wake up with this weird engulfing feeling. It used to happen everyday a couple of years back, but now it's reduced to only when there is ""something"" happening..any something. 

I always thought this is my anxiety but today, it's nothing today, it's a birthday but I have absolutely nothing planned, I live with my parents and they couldn't care less about this day and I really don't want to think of this day as anything special. Why the hell am I waking up with this weird thing in my gut..is this what excitement is? Am I subconsciously excited about my birthday?

Anxiety,"It's really hard to ""be strong and carry on"" when all I want to do is curl up in bed and go to sleep.","I feel so tired and anxious right now, and I have so much to do, both at work and at home. There is no time to ""be weak"" or fall apart, because there's too much to do and too many expectations that I feel like I have to keep carrying on. 

I have an amazing support system in my partner, who keeps me grounded and sane, but I've had a day that started in anxiety and continued in anxiety, and will undoubtedly end in anxiety. I don't want to be strong, do chores, make dinner, stay calm at work, be in a good mood when I get home. I just want to go home, crawl into bed, and cry.

More than anything, I want to live in a society where it's okay to be weak, it's okay to fall apart, it's okay to take time off of work, not because you're physically ill, but because you're mentally ill. Where bosses know how to support their employees who are mentally ill, and check in with them, and put structure around them that allows them to still continue on with work, but not feel scared they'll get fired if they keep calling out of work or have a bad day or react badly in a meeting because they're stressed out, overworked, overwhelmed.

I'm just tired and anxious and scared, and I want to be able to feel those things and know that the world will continue on. But I can't, I have to be strong and push it all down and ""carry on,"" so that the world doesn't fall apart, and it makes my anxiety all the worse.","You just said everything I‚Äôm feeling right now.

Anxiety,So I hospitalised myself,"I suffer from existential pure-o anxiety.

That means I obsessively ask a lot of deep questions about reality, and the inability to find conceivable answers causes me a great deal of paralysing anxiety.

Currently I'm obsessing about the nature of time. Did everything come into being at the, well, beginning? Has something always existed? Has that something existed in eternal time, or a timeless/changeless state until time/events began? What caused them to begin?

None of the possibilities even make sense to me, and that really disturbs me.

So I decided to go to a mental hospital. Being in the calm, orderly environment helps a bit, and the doctor is very empathetic and really tries to understand what's going on in my head.

She is trying out some medications to reduce the anxiety, and other types of therapy will also be available. Luckily I live in Europe so I don't have to pay for any of this. Though food is pretty shit. üòÄ

Just wanted to share because, well, I feel pretty alone in this.","I can empathize where you're coming from, I find life to be utterly inexplicable in an existential sense. For a while, I dealt with questioning gravity. On other days, I too have questioned the meaning of time. I think the best way to conquer existential anxiety (not that I have) is to practice acceptance therapy. The world is the way it is, we can continue to question, although our minds are not borne to be able to comprehend it's grandeur. Time is solely a concept created by humans, rather, we developed a sense of time to describe the act of change. In the interim, take a deep breath and address the concerns that you have. It is natural to worry, even more so to question the meaning of life. Existentialism is a very real anxiety-inducing concept, something that I've been dealing with since the age of five.

I didn‚Äôt want to go into detail because it would of set off a panic attack and I wouldn‚Äôt of been able to handle both my shit and her panic attack. I needed to take care of me tonight. 

So I tried to be as involved in our night as possible but let her lead and suggest what we did tonight. Obviously she could tell that my night was off and she started to become very distant. I got more upset at this because I wanted to be comforted. 

After a couple of hours she came out and said ‚Äú I know you need me tonight but I don‚Äôt know if I am strong enough.‚Äù She was talking behind a door and refused to come out. ‚ÄúBut I just want to let you know that I love you and one day I will be able to comfort you.‚Äù 

After we kept talking she finally came out and I was able to open up and get the care and love that I needed. 

She didn‚Äôt have a panic attack. She did cry and almost went into it a couple of times but she was able to stay present and be what I needed in a partner tonight. 

We have been working on this for two and a half years and tonight was a major breakthrough. I am so proud of how far she has come.","This makes me super happy. I have an anxiety disorder and sometimes it makes me feel like I can‚Äôt be supportive of my boyfriend because I‚Äôm constantly in my own head. But I‚Äôve also been working on being a better partner for him and being there when he needs me, even if I‚Äôm not feeling okay, because he‚Äôs there when I need him too. I think it actually makes me feel a bit stronger, like I can break away from the anxiety and focus on him and what he needs too.",879,23,5/23/2020 5:27,gozgvh
Anxiety,does anyone get anxious around the noise of yelling?,"i always have a fear of loud yelling even if it‚Äôs not directly at me, i don‚Äôt have a fear of loud noises at all but if it‚Äôs yelling it‚Äôs different. it sends me into panic and overthinking. i‚Äôve been though traumatic things growing up so maybe that‚Äôs it,or does anyone else feel this way too with their anxiety.",I also feel this way and believe it is largely related to my anxiety.,881,95,1/23/2020 23:59,et1xah
Anxiety,Anyone else get randomly worried their gonna be arrested for a serious crime they‚Äôve never committed or have any intention of committing after watching true crime stuff?,,"I used to have this really bad. Now I‚Äôm more afraid of being arrested for not turning a family member in for his crimes, even though I‚Äôve never had enough concrete proof.",878,51,5/2/2020 13:40,gc6n9i
Anxiety,Does anyone else randomly start feeling anxious after the sun sets?,"My anxiety spikes at night for some reason. I start feeling isolated, sad and anxious for some reason. I used to tell myself it's because i had no friends. I made huge progress over quarantine and made new acquaintances and deepened my friendships. I still feel incredibly lonely. I don't know why.","I think I get it, but mine is late at night when everyone is asleep and I'd be all alone. It's too quiet and my thoughts grow louder. Watching sitcoms or light hearted shows make these evenings feel lighter, though. Staying busy works as well.",872,92,6/20/2020 19:31,hcs9e1
