mentalhealth,To the man who saved my life and never knew,"On a rainy March day, 4 years ago, my parents were out of town and I had a full-fledged suicide plan in place. I turned my phone off, I had filled my dog’s food and water bowls, I had my note printed out, and I sat solemnly in the silence of my home, enjoying what I believed was my final meal- a bowl of Kraft Mac n Cheese. 

You see, I was a freshman in college, and had gotten raped by a man I had recently met. When I attempted to speak out against what happened to me, I was immediately labeled a whore. Anything I said was discredited by him and his friends, since I had freely chosen to go and see him at night. Besides, he was a Marine. His reputation was impeccable. People with so much to lose don’t do things like that, right?

After multiple attempts to tell my foreign parents that I was struggling mentally, and with all of those attempts being minimized to “depression is for the weak”, I had had enough.

Halfway through my Mac n Cheese, I heard a knock at my front door. Strange, since it was a Friday night and I was not expecting company. I decided to answer the door anyways. 

It was a guy I had went to high school with. I did not consider him a friend, but he knew where I lived because we were partners for a high school group project years prior. He kept in touch after high school because during the time we spent working on our group project, he had discovered my closeted obsession for Pokémon. He would occasionally send me interesting updates about the game. Despite this, I overlooked him and admittedly never really thought much about his presence in my life. 

I was, obviously, very confused why he had showed up to my house, unannounced. He reached into his pocket and handed me a pack of unopened Pokémon cards. He said that he had been at the store, and remembered that we had briefly discussed a particular card set a few weeks prior, so he decided to buy it for me. He said that he had texted, asking if he could come drop it off, but that his message was not delivering. Since my house was on the route back to his, he decided to stop by to drop it off. It was a nice gesture, but in that moment, I could not have cared less. As I thanked him and went to close the door, he asked if I wanted to go for a drive. I said no thanks, and that I had other things planned for the night. He was never a pushy guy, but he insisted that I joined him. I sighed, and grabbed my jacket. 

He aimlessly drove me around. We sat in absolute silence for hours, besides him occasionally asking if the temperature in his car was okay and if it was okay if he stopped for gas. I was confused on what we were doing. A part of me was afraid that he was working up the nerve to do what the Marine had done to me months prior. Another piece of me was terrified at the fact that I was too drained, my spirit so broken, to even care if he did. 

But he didn’t.

He drove. He drove until his tank was nearing empty. He went and filled his tank. And then, he kept driving. I don’t know why I didn’t question it, but I guess I was just so relieved that my plans for the night had changed. In that moment, I knew that I, in fact, did not want to kill myself. When my mind came to that realization, I began sobbing hysterically. Would you believe me if I said that he simply kept on driving? He kept driving until I began to doze off. When he noticed, he took me home. As I was exiting his car, he said to me, “Anything else planned for tonight?” I shook my head no. He nodded, and thought for a moment, before saying, “Text me tomorrow to let me know how you liked the cards.” I nodded and went inside. I took the suicide note I had sitting on the coffee table, and put it into my dad’s shredder in his home office. I took the Pokémon cards out of my pocket, and placed them in the place the note had been. I told myself that I would wait to open them the next morning. Because for the first time, in a very long time, there was a “next morning” to look forward to. 


From that day on, Kraft Mac n Cheese became a food I would eat whenever I was feeling particularly low. Rather than it being a last meal of sorts, it now serves as a source of comfort- a reminder that there are always mini sources of joy in this world, whether that be a bowl of Mac n Cheese, or a pack of Pokémon cards.",This pulled my heart strings. Im so happy this story had such a happy ending. I dont know how things are now but i want to say that this made my day. Thank you,1928,50,5/10/2020 1:22,ggs39f

mentalhealth,Does anyone else have random thoughts pop in your head about something you did years ago and get a sudden wave of guilt and feel like shit for hours?,"Can’t focus, I’m getting hot and cold really fast and it’s making feel sorta sick all because I saw a photo that reminded me asking my mom (just left my dad and had basically nothing) to get clothes from a store instead of the thrift store because I didn’t want kids to pick on me.

mentalhealth,My Dad shot himself today..,"I don’t know where else to put this but I need to get it out. Today my dad killed himself. He had been battling depression for a long time. Today he got way too drunk (he was a recovering alcoholic) and got in to a big argument with my mom. They were fighting on the front porch while I was in the kitchen making a bottle for my 8 mo son who was sleeping in his crib on the other side of the house. After they were arguing, my dad walked in to the house, shut his bedroom door and shot himself in the head. I was right outside the door when it happened and I can’t get the sound out of my head. Luckily, my son slept through the whole thing and was quickly taken out of the house by his father while I called 911. My eyes hurt but I can’t sleep or close them with out everything replaying through my head. I feel like my life is in pieces and I don’t know what to do. That’s all I can really say...

If you need help, please get it. Because of a horrible combination of alcohol, guns and depression, my son no longer has the grandpa that he so much adored and I am now with out a dad.

EDIT: Thank you all so much for all the sentiments. I know it’s strange to post something so personal to random people but hearing from all of you makes me feel less alone, I guess. I 100% agree about therapy and I am definitely no stranger to it and the help it gives. Sadly, money is tight and my insurance is shit so if anyone has any resources to help me find a cheaper solution when it comes to therapy, I would be very grateful.","There are no words anyone can say that will help you right now. Take one step after the other, care for yourself as much as you care for others. Sleep when you can. Hold each other. Ask for help when you need it.",1062,70,7/28/2020 10:58,hzcmoq
mentalhealth,Anyone else feeling very behind everyone their age. Like they're accomplishing all these things and I'm just here.,Anyone relate?,"I used to really feel this way, especially when people started to move into houses, have kids and here I was in my 1 bedroom apartment lol.

mentalhealth,"I was inches from committing suicide 6 months ago, today I signed a lease for the nicest apartments in my city. Hang in there.","Long story short, over the summer I was planning on driving my car over the edge of a cliff after I dropped some people off on vacation. I was overwhelmed in life and saw no way out aside from ending it all. Felt like a disappointment because I dropped out of college, worked as a personal trainer at a gym where I was taken advantage of and forced to work 16-17 hour days for pennies. Lived in some slummy apartments with no AC and barely had any grocery money. I usually bummed pizza from local Pizza shops at the end of the night when someone hadn’t picked up a carry out order. Sometimes I’d get something, sometimes I’d get told to fuck off. Got on average 3 hours of sleep aside from Saturday nights. Mental health was at an all time low.

I made some changes that started with therapy. After that, I got a lucrative new sales job, love the people I work with, practice Muay Thai weekly, work out every day, and am in a much better place mentally. 

If you think this post is about me rooting my own horn... You’re right. I’m damn proud of the progress I’ve made. Whatever it is you’re going through, keep fighting. Keep waking up every day.

I feel like my coworkers take on so much work compared to myself. They have so many ongoing projects yet I can hardly handle the few that I do have.

mentalhealth,I think that “13 reasons why” is a very bad way of “spreading awareness”,"As the title suggests, I think that 13RW is a very bad portrayal of mental health, suicide, depression etc. and it shouldn’t be promoted as a show that “raises awareness”, when it’s just harmful. It portrays suicide as something “beautiful” and “meaningful” and not what it really is. And the whole “blame it on other people even though they tried to help me” thing? Nope nope nope, that’s so toxic. Idk if I just feel that way because of my PTSD (an older guy blamed me for his suicide attempt because I didn’t “help him enough” even though I did everything I could and was only 13), but it’s just not really how suicide should be portrayed, in my opinion. Also, the way they show flashbacks of Hannah Baker from when she was alive makes it seem like she’s still alive in some way. They reeeeally push this harmful “suicide is something you choose as a weapon to hurt other people” agenda, when in reality, suicide is often the exact opposite. 
Idk, personally I really don’t like that show, and i think it’s harmful. I once opened up about my suicidal thoughts and depression to a friend, and she was all like “who made you feel that way?” like it was other people’s fault. Like sure, trauma and toxic relationships with people can worsen suicidal thoughts and depression but I just don’t feel like the show portrayed it in a helpful way.","Of course it’s not good for spreading awareness. The show is meant to be entertaining, the producers don’t actually care about “the cause”. They just want the show to be successful and make them money.",930,60,5/5/2020 16:51,ge1dz0
mentalhealth,My boyfriend undressed me without asking. It’s not what you think though.,"I am usually the most positive, motivated, & outgoing person ever, but with COVID-19 affecting every aspect of my life, it wasn’t a surprise I became deeply depressed. I had been trapped in my apartment for months with no job, money, or motivation. My mentality started shifting to something more cynical as well. One night in particular though, my boyfriend helped catalyze me getting better. It was insanely difficult to get out of bed. Sure I’d get up maybe for an occasional snack or a quick bathroom break but I was just stuck mentally and physically, and in this case I hadn’t left my mattress for days. I wasn’t okay at all. Then one day out of the blue, my boyfriend went into my closet and grabbed me one of his t- shirts, (my) underwear, and (my) shorts. He propped me up and undressed, then dressed me while my eyes swelled up. He didn’t even ask. He just did it. Every time I think about that moment I tear up because it was the most intimate and sweetest thing anyone has ever done for me. I really am so lucky to have such a caring man in my life. I can’t wait to marry him some day. Our relationship is him doing the most selfless acts of love for me, and even though he might not think much of his actions, they mean the world to me. And for an update on my mental, I am doing incredibly better. Don’t want to go too in depth because he deserves all the love on this post.

mentalhealth,I brushed my teeth and washed my face properly for the first time in a while,"I know..yuck...ive always had difficulty keeping my hygiene up bc of mental illness but always managed to “complete” it anyways since I had to go to school and stuff. Now that its all online and i havent really had reason to go outside it got bad. My skin and teeth were really horrible..Again, thats gross, i know i know. I wonder how you’d explain to someone that mental illness makes hygienic tasks harder without them being grossed out?

Anyways, today I actually properly brushed my teeth and washed my face. My teeth feel super clean. I used an exfoliator and toner and moisturiser and all that stuff with my face. I got water everywhere but It felt nice. My face is soft now. 

Even though my room is a dirty mess, I barely got any sleep, and my school work is bad right now at least I did something. I don’t feel completely “awake” if that makes sense but at least I managed to do something today.

mentalhealth,"Just had my cousin's memorial on Zoom, and it was atrocious.","My cousin recently killed herself. We were close when we were growing up. Her parents were extremely strict and had very high expectations of her, expectations she obviously felt she couldn't meet. 

I'm pissed off because in her memorial, not once did they mention it was a suicide. The closest thing I could find to an acknowledgement of that fact was in an obituary posted elsewhere online, where they said she ""succumbed to the pressures of COVID-19"" which is the most bullshit way to sugar-coat a suicide they could've come up with. As someone who has been very very close to taking my own life, having been hospitalized for that very reason just last year, it bothered me to my core that they pretended like it didn't happen. Just sang songs about god, beating around the bush and making it clear that she would be going to ""heaven"" and not ""hell"" even though everyone knows she did the big bad and committed ""sin"". No recognition at all for the pain she had obviously been dealing with silently for her entire life.

I posted on her memorial site, just a quick blurb of some memories I had with her, a nice photo of us when we were young,  and I quick sentence at the end basically saying ""Some of us face our struggles silently, and you never know who could be fighting an invisible battle, so always be there to lend a shoulder to someone, whether they ask for it or not."" And I linked NAMI and the suicide hotline. 

They fucking deleted my post and asked me to take all references to suicide or struggles out. They reached out to my parents too to try and reign me in. 

I'm honestly appalled. They seem embarrassed and ashamed of her, and they want to hide what she did because it makes them look bad in the ""eyes of God"". Fuck man. Wouldn't even let a supportive message and a link to NAMI slip in there. Had to be clean and without any reference to mental health whatsoever.

I feel so bad for her. If her parents made \*me\* feel this invalidated in one fell swoop, I can't imagine what her life was like with them.

Just needed to vent, thanks for reading.",This breaks my heart.,898,61,12/6/2020 4:28,k7mxc8

mentalhealth,After 9 years of homelessness I have a roof over my head and feel good.,"I am 30 years old man from germany with abitur and have been homeless since 2011, that is until last febuary. I guess I have mental health issues but im not in therapy at the moment, the current situation put that a bit on the back burner. But in the past I hated myself and attempted to end my life on a handfull of occasions, getting always closer to breaking and doing it.

Maybe three month ago I was approched by a social worker and he helped me find my way to a home for young men in rough situations in just a couple of weeks. It is still hard to belive how easy that was. For about a month and a half I just kinda houng out and got acclimated but kept some of my old habbits up (not drugs, just kinda being aimless). With Corona crashing the party, I spend all of my time at home and lazed around.

But this week I started to work in the extensive garden. Planting crops, installing watering systems and stuff. Today I planted 100+ onions, waterd some salat and cleaned up a volleyball field. I felt good doing that. Then I had myself a nice cold shower and sat down to write this. Im happy right now. Im happy that I enjoyed work.

mentalhealth,My mom broke up with me for Donald Trump,"About a week ago, my mom told me she wasn't interested in corresponding any further after Trump lost. I'm a gay trans person so I obviously voted Biden.

EDIT: Thank you to all the kind and supportive people. This really hurts, but your empathy is a comfort.

To the folks that think I'm exaggerating or leaving something out, I implore you to drive to a small town, then take in the Trump bumper stickers on every car and Trump banners beside every house. I've driven by multiple Biden road signs with bullet holes in them out in the middle of nowhere. 

I have been trying to get my parents to stop berating me with Trump news for more than four years now. They have ruined dinners out, caused friction in relationships, and generally made my life stressful since the day he decided to run for office by talking about him constantly, aggressively, and refusing to listen to what anyone else has to say. This is not on me or for lack of trying to understand their POV.

I really don't think I'm exaggerating or being rude to state that this is cult-like behavior. A cult is literally defined as ""a system of religious veneration and devotion directed toward a particular figure or object."" This definitely fits the bill for a lot of small town Americans.

When I'm not feeling really low with depression, I actually enjoy a nice shower, and come out feeling fresh and revitalized. I think that's pretty normal for most people.

But when I'm really low, I can barely will myself to do it. It's so much fucking effort to even think about. Finding the closed I want to wear, clearing the bathroom counter of the stuff I haven't put away because 'I'll do it later, when I feel better'. Turning on the water to the correct tempurature, The actual showering, then gathering the dirty clothes. I end up feeling more frustrated and exhausted after I take a shower.

That somehow I’m not as “victorious” because I couldn’t make it without meds. Look, if someone can do it without meds I think that’s great, but I don’t think they should be put on a pedestal as someone who “made it”. I’m a 46 year old mom and dammit I’m just as victorious. Yes I’m on medication for my OCD, depression, and schizophrenia. So what?! I’m still here, my kids still have their momma and to me a win is a win. I hope you don’t feel ashamed if you’re on meds. You shouldn’t.","there's nothing wrong with being on meds! more power to you for reaching out and getting it.

mentalhealth,Does anyone else get angry about how much effort you have to put in to stay stable?,"I woke up exhausted, feeling like sand was holding me down. 

But I knew the sand wasn’t real. I was capable of being a function human, so I decided to be one. I got out of bed, showered and brushed my teeth, I put on clothes and left the house briefly to shop. And then I binge ate crap food, drank vodka, watched 10 hours of tv whilst taking lots of pain meds for back trouble. 

I’m not really sure what I’m trying to say. I guess I want people to know that I tried. I fought back at my body and forced myself up, forced myself to do the bare minimum of existing and damnit - I was so proud. I want the satisfaction of ‘doing the healthy thing’ even though it was hard, and then I want the reward to be a sudden ability to live easily. 

But it didn’t come. I gave in to the dull ache of sadness and consumed sugar, salt and digital crap until I felt sick. I’m back in bed now thinking about every mistake I made today and how I wish I was stronger. 

I know that a path back to a healthy mental space/ lifestyle is going to be a long, hard road after neglecting it for so long. And I know I have to do it, and do it now before it deteriorates further. I just wish it wasn’t so intensely challenging. I wish that I didn’t have to eat healthily, exercise, keep a tidy house, be social JUST TO STAY AFLOAT.

Missing a run means missing on the happy endorphins I rely on to keep me going through the day. Having an unhealthy meal makes me sluggish, that in turn makes me feel that tiny bit worse which is enough to make me not do chores. I hate being in such a fragile state where i’m not quite mega-depressed, just always on the verge of not leaving my bed for 48 hours. 


TL:DR Life is hard, I like easy things. Nothing worthwhile comes easily.","I, too, am addicted to endorphins. High-five, buddy!

It sounds like you need to take baby steps to a more wholesome lifestyle. Start off just working out, and in your spare time just rest and relax.

mentalhealth,Does anyone else feels like their mental illness make them stupid/forgetful?,"I feel like in general I have become more forgetful, spacey, and just stupid. 

I have depression that, I think, has gotten worse over the years. I also have GAD, and every day after dealing with both I just feel so exhausted and braindead.

I can't remember things anymore, I feel like I don't think properly, and I'm worried that people are starting to think less of me because of it.

Does anyone else feel this way? How did you overcome it?


Update: WOW. I did not expect for this to blow up. Thank you all so much for sharing your experiences and kind words. I made this post after my mom got mad at me for forgetting to get gas in my car. Essentially she made me feel useless, and called me horribly irresponsible. On top of that I forgot to shut the door of the garage (luckily my sibling was able to help me before my mom noticed)

Also to answer some questions that gave come up:

I am not on any medications

I exercise daily (those stationary bikes are awesome!)

I live in a very stressful home environment.


I've seen a lot of helpful solutions, especially the one about getting a planner! Thank you all again. I have read all of your comments and appreciate you all so much <3","I completely understand where you're coming from. Between my depression and anxiety, and my medication that makes me kinda drowsy, I feel like a space cadet a lot of the times. I can't hold onto dates to save my life. I was doing a LOT better last year because I had a planner that I got into the habit of making myself check on a daily basis, and I put absolutely EVERYTHING in it: doctor visits, work schedules, birthdays, any other appointments... hell, I even had days on my monthly calendars noting exactly which days were paydays and which days I had specific bills due. For the first time in my life I really felt like I had a handle on keeping track of everything because of that planner.

Then covid happened, and the planner I'd gotten for this year suddenly felt almost meaningless. Everything was up in the air. Schedules were made up and the points didn't matter. I'm trying very hard to get back into my good habits again, but it's a struggle.

I guess the best advice that I can offer is to get a planner and make it your bible.",763,63,9/8/2020 16:56,ioxaw0
mentalhealth,Do you ever feel like the more you learn the more depressing the world is?,Ignorance truly is bliss.,"It really depends on the attitude you carry in the face of the stark realities of life. Which I know from experience can be very difficult to control. Especially when there’s a chemical imbalance involved.

Still, there is a way to deal with knowing things most people do not. I like to look around and laugh. Because it really is all so ridiculous when you think about it. Here we are on a rock in space spinning around a massive nuclear fusion reactor. Everything that is eventually will not be. Everyone gets sick, gets old, and eventually dies. And there’s noting that I can actually find wrong with any of that. Why would there be anything wrong with anything in the grand scheme of things?

The world used to get more depressing the more I read and payed attention to the news. But for some reason, and I think that reason is my independent studies of mindfulness and eastern philosophy. That really isn’t the case anymore. But that’s just my experience.",758,50,7/18/2020 20:35,htnofh

Okay thanks.","Absolutely. I have PTSD and anxiety and I’d honestly prefer to just stay inside. Quarantine was kind of a blessing. You aren’t abnormal for feeling this way at all. It’s totally understandable. I’ve found what helps is small exposures to going outside each day, even for a walk. It helps me a lot. The more you expose yourself to the outside in the form of outdoor excursions, the less scary it becomes.

mentalhealth,I am looking for someone who helped me years back with my eating disorder. If it's you please let me know.,"I really hope you see this.

I'm. Not sure if it's even this subreddit but I'm trying my luck. 

I lost my old account and don't remember it at all, because I changed my phone alot within those times.

I was a 16 years old male with Bulimia Nervosa, I opened up here about my issues and alot of you good folks helped me. 

A random user reached out to me and started helping out, by giving me advice and opened up to me about her own problems. She gave me a place to vent and someone to reach out to. 

Now I haven't been bulimic for the last 2 years (20 now), I did it solely from education and will which I'm proud of, because proper therapy is not accessible here. I started exercising, and educated myself alot about nutrition and physical health, I sometimes relapse, but very rarely (once a day every couple of months or so). And she definetly helped me alot. And I want to thank her, and talk to her. Oh Boi do I have alot of stories to tell her about (unfortunately not all are good). 

She is a married middle aged woman with kids, she is Pyromaniac, would talk to me about it and  about her daily routine of how she handles it.

mentalhealth,I self harmed since i was about 9.i haven't done it in 2 years now and don't have the urge to. Yay,"I hope this post isn't triggering for others going through the same. But i am glad the urge has gone for now.

I never admitted this to anyone but my best friend. I have self harmed since i was about 9 years old. 

I always cut myself in places it could be passed off as an accident. I never wanted people to know i was doing it but i just felt the urge to feel something physical other than emotional. 

The last time i self harmed was 2 years ago and it was so deep it still hasnt fully healed to this day. I feel ashamed of them and hate when people ask me about how i got my scars or when they look at them. It gets harder each time to explain how i got the wounds but sometimes i felt it was the only way to feel something.

Everyone around me seems to have goals and passions. Not that I don't (I do), but I feel so far from achieving them or that I'll never achieve them. I'm graduating college in December and I'm absolutely terrified of being out of school. I look around at my peers and they seem so much more... professionally mature than me? It's a weird feeling and its hard to explain. Everyone around me seems to always be doing *something* to benefit them and then there's me. I procrastinate; I have major anxiety; I want to just sleep every day and I am so down in the dumps. I don't know what to do and I'd love to meet people who feel the same way as me. Ive been struggling with this feeling since I started college and I don't know what to do.

Thank you for the 500+ upvotes and award! I had never gotten an award before!! Love you all ❤️❤️❤️❤️","So, they say that young people may experience a quarter-life crisis. I'll tell you about mine.

In 2013, when I was 25/26, I had just graduated from Columbia with my Masters. So many of my peers already had so much more work experience and got great job offers. I tried to stay in NY but ended up going back home to CA bc I couldn't afford to stay. Within months of graduating, my dad almost died (complications of diabetes) and he and I moved in with my grandmother so we could care for him. I entered a deep depression. I thought I'd never find a job and would have to care for my father the rest of his life. Seeing the man who raised me look so frail and fall into a deep depression himself was devastating to say the least. I was crying nearly every day and stopped taking care of myself.

Eventually, I started to pull myself out of it with some help from a grad school friend. It took me months to finally get a job and then nearly a year to finally get a job somewhat related to my degree. 7 years after graduating and I'm near getting my professional license. And I live in an amazing apartment with a great boyfriend.

Trust me when I say: your time will come. The WORST thing you can do is compare yourself with others. I'd recommend a social media detox. For one thing, people only broadcast the best part of their lives...rarely do people share their struggles. Another thing is, if you spend less time looking at how others live you can focus on how you live.

Take care.",722,56,9/20/2020 4:31,iw7cul

mentalhealth,Adopted a cat during quarantine and it is unbelievable how our bond together has helped ease the pains of isolation.,"So long story short, a couple months ago I was losing my mind feeling trapped inside my apartment with very little to do. Like many of you, probably. It was just me and my roommate going about our usual routine, and life just seemed so... bleak. Then my friend asked if I could babysit his kitten and it was a game changer. I found out cuddling, nuzzling, feeding and caring for a cat was so rewarding and realized how special the bond between cats and humans are. So I adopted my own kitten a few weeks later, and we fell instantly in love with each other. I have so much time to appreciate the little moments between us, to watch him grow, and to witness our bond grow stronger everyday because we spend so much time together. Not only that, but I feel more confident in reaching out to my friends and family on social media/phone again because I don’t feel alone anymore. I would say if you are feeling alone or you are looking for a sense of purpose during this time, I highly recommend getting a pet, because this is a rare occasion where your bond with your pet will be stronger than ever. If you want to follow my cat on IG, I post almost every day and you can watch him grow too. @finn_the_feline_._._

TLDR; Adopted a cat during quarantine, and our bond continues to grow rapidly day by day. Very rewarding experience and eases the pains of quarantine.","Two years ago today, my housemate came home with a cat she'd adopted through a charity. A month later, my housemate left to go home to america and she left the cat behind. I was like, I guess I have a cat now.  
  
A year later, the cats previous owner got in touch and asked me if I'd take the cats mum too. So now I have two cats, despite never actually setting out to have even one cat.  
   
The bond I have with these two girls is so precious. I couldn't have done lockdown without them. I've been mostly on my own for the last 7 months, and yet every day they give me a reason to wake up, get out of bed, talk out loud to someone, smile, laugh, and get in touch with friends  and family by sending them pics.  
    
People who say cats are assholes who don't love you, don't really understand cats if you ask me. My cats adore me, and I adore them. It sounds dramatic, but some days I feel like I'd protect them as if they were my own children (I don't have children so I can't compare the feeling, but I imagine this is how it feels).

It's literally the same phrases every time. It's like they are a bunch of robots. So goddamn repetitive and predictable.

I sleep for hours, play games, binge eat, anything.

mentalhealth,"As a rape survivor, I want to let you know that things will get better! Maybe not now, maybe not immediately but they eventually will! Don’t give up!","Although I myself still struggle after being raped nearly 2 and a half years ago (and the rape will impact me my whole life) I want to let you know that time really heals wounds.

After, I got raped it was the worst time in my life. There are no words to describe how horrible it was. From a person who was very confident, lived in multiple countries, travelled the world I was afraid to go to my local grocery shop. I nearly had a panic attack when I was alone with a man in a shopping aisle. I had to postpone all my exams, my academic and social life suffered immensely. I had PTSD, anxiety, depression etc. I had very dark thoughts. I considered taking a year out of university because just getting out of bed was a struggle for me. I could write a book about all the negative effects of rape.

But now I honestly feel so much better. Of course, I still suffer the effects. But compared to the past I have made great progress. I am planning to continue my therapy though as I feel like my healing process is not over.

But I want to let you know that things will get better. I have graduated from top 30 university in the world with a prestigious degree, last year I was a committee member of multiple societies at my university. I am looking forward to life.

One thing I would tell you is that don’t put a timeline or deadline for your recovery. And don't compare yourself to others. I used to wonder will I ever get better. Why I am not getting better already? Why is it taking so long? Don’t compare your recovery to someone else. Although I will recover the whole of my life, what I mean is that If you are not getting better/progressing in a certain period of time is okay.

Everyone is different and take as much time you need to heal.

For me, it was also hard to see all my friends enjoying life and this tragedy happening to me. But now I am slowly accepting that life didn’t turn out exactly the way I wanted. And bad things happened to good people.

I am posting this because I felt much better myself reading stories of rape victims that persevered and ‘overcame’ their trauma.

I am wishing you nothing but the best. And please don’t give up. Life is beautiful, even if it does not see this way now.","Congrats on your progress!

mentalhealth,"I Am Thoroughly Disgusted By The Portrayal of Mental Health in 13 Reasons Why Season 4, And Disturbed By the Amount of People Defending It.","13 Reasons Why has always been controversial from the start. I understand where people come from when they say the first season glorified suicide. Personally, I believe the first season had good intentions, and truly was trying to raise awareness for suicide.

Of course, they completely sabotaged Hannah Baker’s character in S2, which had a detrimental effect on the message.

But Season 4 - oh, it makes my blood boil. Clay’s undiagnosed, undefined “mental illness” - at best described by the show as “trauma” - is used as an excuse for outrageously bad behavior. By bad behavior, I mean locking his friends in a cabin in the woods and clanging an axe against the door. I mean vandalizing his school and burning his principal’s car. I mean waving a gun around in front of the entire student body.

And worst of all, when he finds out his adoptive brother is dying, his immediate response is to run to the police station and yell, “I’ve got a gun!” Why? Because he needed people “to see how broken he was.”

This one really hit me close to home. When I was 6, my infant sister had to spend all 4.5 months of her life on a ventilator in the hospital. When she died - near Christmas time - I did not go terrorize people so that they could see “how broken I was.”

Yet [few people](https://youtu.be/ynewf90xWZc) see it that way. When I say this, 13 RW fans tell me “Well, you were 6. Your emotions were not as deep as our beloved FICTIONAL character Clay.”

I hate what that show became, and the perverse effect it has.

I rang in my 24th today in a room with a baby suspected for COVID-19 who was very sick. I was holding the baby while the doctor was doing a lumbar puncture. Wearing the same mask I've been wearing all day and full gown, face shields, gloves.

I could feel my phone vibrating with messages from friends/family. I'm not even an emotional person but I just started crying silently. Everyone was so concentrated that no one noticed. I went to the back after and spent 20 mins having a good cry while listening to the stable song from BOTW (LOL).

mentalhealth,I feel bad for my cat because we don’t have a routine anymore.,"When I had a predictable schedule, my cat would make sure I followed it to the letter every morning.

He woke me up right before my alarm so there was time for me to pet him. Then would hop off and meow until I got out of bed. Then led me to the bathroom, and would wait on top of the toilet until I was done showering. If I took longer than ten minutes he’d start meowing. Then he’d sit on top of my counter and watch me brush my teeth, and try to grab the floss as I was using it. Then he would hop down and strut in front of me, looking behind to make sure I was following, and lead me to my bag. Once I picked up my bag, he’d lead me downstairs to the kitchen. He would then sit on one of the chairs and watch me cook and eat breakfast, and when I was getting all ready to leave, he would wait for me to walk over and pet him goodbye for the day.

When I got home, he’d be waiting for me. He’d lead me back upstairs and stand in the spot my bag’s supposed to go. Then we’d play fetch with toy balls and I’d give him lots of pets until we tired out. Then I would get on the computer for work and games, and he’d hop into his cat bed nearby and fall asleep. When it was time for bed, he sometimes even got up to lead me to the bathroom and make sure I was brushing my teeth, then go back to bed.

Since the pandemic started, I’ve had nowhere to go. Nothing to do. And even several months later, I can tell he misses the routine. He still tries to wake me up on time. He’s been trying different tactics. The most effective one so far seems to be bringing a toy and doing cuddle rolls just out of reach of the bed so I have to get up to pet him. He still meows if I’m in the shower for more than ten minutes. When I do finally go downstairs, he rushes ahead of me halfway down and leads me the rest of the way. He frequently makes circles around my feet as I’m on the computer, asking for pets and playtime. It breaks me heart when he does these things. I know he’s trying so hard.

4. We all have our own journey don't compare your life/struggles to those of others.
5. You deserve growth as a human being even if you don't feel like you do. Our illnesses cloud our perspective of the past, present, and future.
6. Don't believe everything you think.
7. There is no ""cure"". Suffering is part of human existence and by learning to accept it and sit with it we can overcome it.

mentalhealth,I recently read this and I think it might help someone else too: “Always do your best” doesn’t mean “work until you collapse”. If you push yourself past your best abilities you will do worse. Doing your best means knowing your limits and working within them.,It’s not the literal thing I read but something along those lines and I actually had an “OH” moment that I have extremely rarely. I never realized that I misheard doing my best as I should push myself to be *the* best. But how good you are at something is on a bell curve and if you strive past “your best” you will become worse. It actually kinda helps a little with not feeling guilty about taking breaks but anyway I thought someone else might need to hear this too.,"I think I needed this, thank you.",562,18,4/13/2020 20:47,g0rabm
mentalhealth,I don't want quarantine to end,"After a long time of chaos, this is the first time in many years I've been able to create a daily and healthy routine without getting overwhelmed by it and destroying it due to anxiety and changes. I have school phobia and I don't want Zoom classes to end, I feel so comfortable studying on a screen and not having to trigger my school and social phobia. Obviously there are things social distancing made it worse for me, like intrusive thoughts and lack of therapy but I'm now getting used to it and I fear when all of this ends I'm going to go to my unhealthy lifestyle again because of stress.","I almost wish quarantine never happened because now I got a taste of what it truly is like to not have to deal with so many unnecessary emotionally/physically draining interactions with people. I have never felt so grounded in myself, I’m doing shit I love to do like reading, learning. I took a step further and got rid of all my social media accounts. It was the best decision I ever made. 

But now, the thought of going back to that old reality is all the more scarier.",563,46,5/11/2020 17:06,ghrmqw

mentalhealth,Stop telling boys that they shouldn't cry.,"When I was around 10 years old, I watched my teenage brother nurse a wound. He was crying as he soaked his scraped knee with water in the bathtub.

I looked at him with disdain. ""Why are you crying?"" I asked in annoyance. I didn't realize it then, but my visceral reaction to his emotional vulnerability reflected something that I had been taught earlier in my childhood: boys aren't supposed to cry. 

When I became a young adult, I had a lot of trouble expressing my emotions. I put on a smile for everyone I saw, and avoided talking about anything that would trigger an emotional reaction. When my emotions built up to the point where I couldn’t control them, I would explode. It took a long time to learn how to share my feelings - something that people still consider to be a sign of weakness in men.

I think I’m one of the millions of men out there who’ve been told, at some point in their lives, to repress their emotions. I now understand how emotional repression can lead to a variety of complications in mental health. I wrote a song to challenge the idea that men shouldn’t show their feelings simply because they are men. Listen link below.

For all the guys out there listening to this song - be vulnerable. Feel your emotions. Share with others how you feel. I think that’s even more manly than being a tough guy.

Thank you guys so much for reading this. Please be safe, everyone. xoxo

mentalhealth,I failed my 2nd year of uni and I just need someone to tell me it's okay,"I'm doing so bad after getting better for the past year. 

Jesus fuck I'm trying so hard but I feel like no matter what I'll keep failing. I am genuinely interested in what I'm studying, but I'm so behind and have such bad work ethic now, I don't understand even the basics. I feel like an absolute idiot. 

I had this grand plan when I left highschool. I wanted to study outside of the US. It was really difficult to find a way to do it, but I had a dream and I was so determined to accomplish it. But depression hit me bad and I almost didn't graduate highschool, my parents didn't support me and I wasn't able to go to college because of it so I was forced to take a gap year. I broke my foot and was bed ridden for 6 months and became very depressed. Finally got to uni and failed the first year. Just failed my 2nd. I'm basically at 0 credits and 3 years behind where I'm supposed to be. My twin brother is almost graduating and I'm basically exactly where I was when I left highschool. I feel like I'm losing years off my life and for some reason I can't just live it.

Not to mention there's a lot of shitty things going on on top of all this and I just feel so fucking alone. I feel a loss of motivation to do anything. I don't know what to do anymore. I feel alone and unsupported, and so so afraid. I have no idea what my future holds, and I no longer have a dream. I just want to be happy again.","Fuck yes its okay!

mentalhealth,It’s been 10 years since my suicide attempt and I’m so glad I didn’t succeed!!,"Somehow I missed my 10 year anniversary of the worst day of my life. I suppose that’s a good thing that I’m so involved with the good bits of life now that I almost forgot that this wasn’t always the case. 

Ten years ago I threw my legs out a 6th floor window at college, intending to hit the earth below me. I was in the thick of some really terrible times then. I was 19, heartbroken, homesick, lost, and very confused. I remember the sharp air that rushed in the room when I opened the window that very cold and snowy February night. It felt like little needles on my skin; a stark contrast to the hot, salty tears streaming down my face. I was in trouble for drinking on campus...again.  However, the drinking wasn’t just purely fun and games. I was using it to cope with a lot of uncertainty and hopelessness. My on again off again boyfriend told me he was dating someone else. He lived with my best guy friend at the time so a lot of “sides” were taken in the whole mess. And somewhere along the way my roommate moved out. I was alone. 

I spent the remainder of the week at the hospital under psychiatric care. The days I spent there blur together now. I was in such a haze of numbness. 
My entire life was uprooted. I got kicked out of college and I had to start over somewhere new. The next several years were spent kicking my ass into gear to show myself and the friends who abandoned me that they didn’t get the best of me. I pushed and pushed myself. I started looking forward and not backward. I learned to love myself again. Slowly. Very slowly. 

I graduated from a new (and better) college with honors two years later. I took a chance and bought a one way ticket to NYC and began living the life I used to only be able to dream about.

10 years later, I am living proof that things get better. Depression and anxiety are challenges I still deal with occasionally, but now I know how to handle it. 

Right now I’m sitting in the house I just bought all by myself. I’m reminiscing about the years I spent living and working in Manhattan, where I had an incredible job and amazing friends. Most days, my life felt like a happy movie. I recently decided to re-locate, slow things down and enjoy the present. Now I’m in the process of renovating my house from the inside out. I volunteer with an organization that raises funds for underprivileged women and children. I carve out time for my hobbies, friends, and loved ones. I’ve truly become a better person. I can now enjoy a glass or two of wine without overdoing it just to cope. I can take a deep breath, a small sip, and appreciate how far I’ve come.

I still have a long way to go. I’m still a work in progress. I haven’t found love yet but I look forward to the day I do. In the meantime, you can catch me cultivating my new herb garden and reading a good book or two. 

If you’re going through what I went through 10 years ago, my best advice is to hang on, know it does get better (and no this isn’t something that people just say. It’s true). You’re not alone. You’re loved. And you’re stronger than you think.
Take a deep breath, be thankful that you are able to do so, and repeat until you truly believe better days are around the corner.

TLDR - I’m 10 years post-suicide attempt and better than ever. I wanted to share my accomplishment with you all and hope this story might help someone.","Proud of you, thanks for the great read! It was inspiring. :) Truly, all I could think is what a beautiful person. Not because you seem to have it more together now, but because you know what you want and have worked on it.

I have never been hit, everything was verbal.
I’ve never been in an abusive relationship.

mentalhealth,My suicidal thoughts and depression.,"If you're reading this can you please upvote it so others can see, thanks for reading this as well it just helps me I guess.

My names Jack, I'm 15 years old, bi (not come out to anyone), have dandruff, acne, pretty fucking ugly all things considered... And severe anxiety and depression.

I was living great until last June. At the time I had 2 best mates, who I'll refer to as M (funny, kind but not entirely good to talk about mental health and touchy feelings) and K (kindest person ever, used to be able to speak about anything to, but mentally isn't great). K had severe mental health issues and was not listening to anybodys advice about seeking help. Eventually I asked M if I should confront her about it, he agreed, I did it because my other friend who I'll refer to as J (narsasistic, arrogant, but has a soft side occasionally) had been telling me for months she was an attention seeker. I figured she'd take it alright but I was wrong. She trusted me more than anyone (her words) and it was the worst thing anyone had apparently told her.

It bothered me alot and I kept trying to make ammends because I felt TERRIBLE.

I was relatively stable in the grand scheme tho.

2 months pass and August aka summer holidays hits! Worst month and a half ever. J had somehow convinced M I was basically a backstabbing, lying piece of shit and essentially the worst person ever.

We argued back and forth for a while. We fell out hard to say the least.

It broke my heart losing both M and K (I guess J) in such a short time and the misery started to sink in.

HOPE WASN'T LOST. I had 2 friends left B (kind, nice to talk with, quiet) and Z (think J but a geek gamer and a textbook bully) I had a plan to get M K and J face to face (all previous stuff was done by text). Z was on holiday. So I tried asking B to get them together, he said to wait until school but I insisted as K didn't go to our school. I accepted tho. However (according to what I've been told) B lied I think and told Z I had manipulated him into trying to get them all together. Z bullied the shit out of me.

This is where I think my depression sunk in, I couldn't think properly, lashed out in anger out everyone, was bored of gaming, etc. Moral of the story, I wanted to put a bullet in my head!

September hit and school started (year 10). Depressed anxious and suicidal my studies went down and thus my grades.

Then my parents split, IT SUCKED. My father isn't exactly great, he can be abusiveish at times.

Everything started to get worse and I ran away several times, and dragged a knife across my arm alot.

I started to sit in the library for most of the day and still did until corona. Got sent work and it definitely helped with my anxiety as I was bullied and a laughing stock in year 9. Pretty badly. So being out of lessons was alright.

I started seeing the school councillor which helped to have someone to talk to. 

In December the school had no choice but to take me to arrow park hospital as I had massive scars across my chest from self harm. I stayed overnight and my parents ended up kinda talking things out.

I had to go to therapy to say the least. I was still on the edge of suicide.

Started the 8 week course this January and it was alright. Helped keep me positive. 
J and Z made me want to die more as they constantly reminded me of what I am, a monster. Told me I was worthless, should just do it and brought up my Instagram stories (I used to post on them suicidal stuff as a cry for help but was just accused of attention seeking). Worse too. 

Throughout the next 2 months I still stayed mostly the same. Suicidal, depressed, anxious, most importantly lonely. Me and M eventually worked things out because I actually put the effort in a lot over several months begging him and K to help me and how sorry I was. They didn't really want to be my friend. K and I are currently on OK terms I think, imma take it slow with her. M and I talk a lot now.

But... I still feel lonely, have to hide how I feel now. Don't really have anyone to talk about this stuff to. Anymore at least. I still hate my life. Want to die. Does make me wonder if I'm actually really liked by anyone.

But how would I describe myself? Gamer (mk11, overwatch, paladins and smash), want to do well but knows I can't, socially awkward on 1 to 1s, try to be funny, nice to people who I care for and are nice to me, would die for my closest friends. But I'm lonely ultimately, depressed, can't ride a bike, swim, fear of driving etc.

I don't know if anyone will make it this far, but if you are, and if you are my age, thank you, I don't know what you really can reply with but please upvote as it just helps I guess my self esteem.","Imma solve all your problems rn

mentalhealth,57 days sober!,"Hi all, male, 20, uk, new to this sub. 57 days ago I attempted suicide and was thankfully saved by two of my friends. It was the result of a serious drug problem and issues at home. I am a minor schizophrenic which makes it difficult sometimes for me to differentiate reality from hallucination. I've also recently started dating a girl who is an absolute saint, she has helped me massively with quitting drugs and alcohol and I can now proudly say I am 57 days sober! It has been hard and it may not seem like much, but I am trying hard to better myself. So yeah that's me...

mentalhealth,I called a suicide hotline recently and was dismissed because I’m a man and I have Tourette’s. 💦🦄😖,"I looked the # up on Google cause I was feeling unstable with signs of psychosis. I know these symptoms well enough after years of dealing with my illness.  I forced myself to remain calm so I could clearly communicate my situation. The woman (her name was Rachel)  speaking with was clearly overwhelmed by how many calls they’ve been getting.  When I told her I was having a mental health crisis she took me seriously enough, but then my verbal tics started.  I could tell that my tics were scaring her so I told her “I’m safe, I just have Tourettes”.  Then I heard the dreaded word come out of my mouth....cunt.  It was clearly a tic, but Rachel’s reaction was to tell me I couldn’t talk to her that way. Her tone went from scared shitless to anger. That was when I knew that there is not going to be any help for me. At least not from a woman.  I realized then that I wasn’t going to be able to get reliable help and to just get off the phone. To be honest, it kinda ramped up my paranoia also. 

Before I got off the phone I calmed myself and quietly told her, “YOU are a mental health professional who has trained for this. When a person experiencing a mental health crisis calls you and uses a word YOU find offensive you need to remember that YOU’RE feelings at that moment are minuscule compared to the pain the person on the other end is going through. Please think about this because you’re hurting some people more than you’re helping them”. 


I am so angry about this. I did everything right. I know from experience how broken our mental health system is, but this really hits a new low.  I took extensive notes because it seemed important and am really tempted to get that woman fired from her job for being so unprofessional, but frankly I’m worried I’ll get a woman on the line in HR and will again be dismissed because of sexism. From now on I will ask for and only speak with men when calling the Suicide Hotline(s).   

One thing I know for sure, I am not calling 911 for a trip to the psych ward anytime soon. If the mental health system is in this much crisis just over the phone imagine how bad it’s falling apart face to face. 

Thank god I’m already so used to self-isolating.

EDIT - 

Thank you to everyone who reached out, I appreciate it. 

Just so this doesn’t head into finger-pointing territory I want to clarify a few things.  It’s easy to take from this that I’m taking my anger out on women. That’s fair and TBH I’ll acknowledge a lack of trust on my part. 

If you wrote something supportive and/or helpful....thank you for hearing me. 

If you wrote something that showed a lack of empathy.....that’s ok. You just didn’t hear me. I’m used to that.","if you have a lot of trouble with verbal calling, have you tried text lines? im scared of speaking out loud so im use to texting- i use the crisis hotline! its 741741 i believe, i use it when it gets really dark. im really sorry you had to go through that. that sounds horrible and disgusting. you deserve help if you need it, im really proud of u for reaching out when u needed it!!",488,40,3/30/2020 14:43,frs1lc
mentalhealth,As i slowly understand my current mental state ive also realized that explaining or asking for help to the wrong people can be extremely dangerous.,"Without having to say much ive realized that my parents and pretty much the majority of people in my life dont understand or are willing to acknowledge my condition and when they end up offering help things can end up getting worse. Giving someone pity can sometimes insult them or make them feel less of a person and due to this trust and accountability isnt entrusted to you. Which is why i personally recommend to sometimes keep things to yourself and only explain to them in a very simple manner that all you need is privacy, distance and time in hopes that they understand. Hope this helps some of y'all.","Honestly the biggest thing. I'm in an extremely low depression right now, and I'm doing as much as I can to try and get out of the funk but nothing is working. I've told my close friends about it, reached out to them to try and get help from them without directly implying & shouldering all this burden on them... but I'm not really getting any response. It's so confusing & I'm really spiraling. Like, I'm clearly not well functioning right now but the people around me aren't really paying attention. idk. They're just constantly acting in ways that hurt me more when I'm trying to reach out... not intentionally, but it just makes it worse.

mentalhealth,Maybe the last time I hugged my son.,"My 29-year-old son just walked out my door, maybe for the last time. He came to see me for the last time until this is over. My kids have all seen me cry many many times, I have suffered major depression my whole life and crying is just part of it for me. But I don't know if I've ever let them see me quite the way I was today, it was like all the horror and dread I have felt in the last few years, the loss of my mother, and our current situation just exploded. He broke the social distance we are trying to observe to hug me because I couldn't stop sobbing. So he left to go home and I have no doubt that if he gets sick, and many of us are going to get sick, he will die. My kind, smart, funny, loving, dependable, hardworking, handsome, disliked by no one, loved by all, talented son with 5 serious respiratory conditions. He has siblings and nieces and nephews and we cannot survive losing him.

mentalhealth,Last month I attempted suicide for the 4th time. Today I was promoted a week into my new job. It does get better.,"I have struggled with mental illness my entire life. I was diagnosed with severe anxiety as a child, depression at 14, ADHD at 16, and bipolar disorder at 20. The first time I seriously considered suicide was when I was 10. Needless to say, it’s been rough.

The pandemic hit me especially hard. In June I quit my job of 6 years due to the effect it was having on my mental health. I was supposed to work at a summer camp in July anyways, but the governor decided the day before I was supposed to start that residential camps would not be running this year. Due to me quitting my previous job I wasn’t eligible for unemployment, so I was no longer able to afford a therapist or my medication.

I found a new job in July but my mental health had declined to the point where I was completely unable to do it. It also involved driving to a different facility every day, which would cause me to vomit with anxiety before every shift. After having a panic attack over parking in Boston, I ghosted them and decided that this was the end for me. I couldn’t do something as simple as sit and stare at a pool for 8 hours, even if the alternative was an empty bank account and a rising self-hatred. How would I ever be able to function independently?

That night I attempted to hang myself. Obviously, it didn’t work, and I’m still here. This frustrated me; I felt like such a failure that I couldn’t even succeed in dying. I ended up relapsing with self harm, and I spent the weeks after that consuming any substance I could get my hands on to numb the pain, waiting for the courage to try again.

After the very much warranted disappointment from my parents, I ended up applying for an overnight warehouse job for an online retailer. From the rumors I’d heard I expected it to suck, but they were right, I needed a job.

They hired me, and I started last week. Turns out it doesn’t suck. And I don’t suck at the job either. Within three days they asked me to apply for a promotion, and today I got a fancy new vest, my shift differential was bumped up by $1.50, and I finally have some hope for the future. I also found out if I stay for a year they can help pay for my education, so for the first time in forever I have a long-term plan for my future. Best of all, I can afford to get help again.

I know I’m going to feel shitty again, but it’s going to get better again after that. I have trouble remembering times like these when I’m really going through it, but for the first time in years I feel capable. I feel like I can take it. I’m a hard worker and I’m no quitter, why would I give up on life like that?

I guess my point is that no matter how dark it seems, how hopeless it feels, or how incompetent you think you are, there’s always a chance for it to get better. I’m moreso making this post to look back on the next time I’m suicidal, but I’m hoping my message will help others a little.

Thank you for reading :) you can do it❤️",Being stuck in a job that you hate/that damages your mental health and not having another option available ist one of the worst feelings one can experience. Having to feel such terrible things for the sole reason to survive is a big burden to bare. I'm happy for you that things turned out nicely! ☺️ In the last few days I sent multiple applications for more fitting jobs for me and I hope I can find a job which is at least mediocre.,471,20,9/23/2020 18:12,iyfkhv
mentalhealth,"For the first time in my life, I talked with a professional about this and was told that I was downright abused and it's like a weight has been lifted off - It wasn't my fault. I wasn't a troubled kid.","\*\*\* please read the edit \*\*\*

For a brief moment in my life from ages 15 to the summer before I turned 17, I lived with my dad and his girlfriend. My dad was a passive, quiet guy that wasn't around much. He didn't want custody, but accepted to take me and my brother who was 12 at the time to live with him while my mom was in Europe taking care of someone. The whole situation was odd. This woman, let's call her C, had an 11 year old son and was not happy about two more kids being added onto her plate. My dad promised we were no trouble and that I was old enough not to need babysitting.

I was rebellious, like most 15 year olds. I was energetic, popular, and sporty. I had just broken up with my boyfriend, and I was just starting high school. Things are already horrible, and to add a stranger to the mix was ever more shitty. After we moved out and went back to live with my mother, I was never the same person. I told my therapist that I wanted to go back to that 15 year old girl again. I was so happy and fun. He asked me to describe when things changed, and this all came up...

This woman legit abused me, and nobody said anything. Nobody defended me, and I blamed myself. I thought I was troubled, that I was difficult, that it was my fault, that my dad didn't like me.

I bleached the lower part of my hair and colored it hot pink. When she found out, she dragged me to the bathroom and locked the door and stood in front of it. She didn't let me out until I cut the parts I had bleached. My hair went from almost above my bra to shoulder length. It looked horrible too. All the while, this large woman with shaved tattooed eyebrows stood behind me and yelled at me.

*Your father will blame me for this! What an idiot! I should just make you cut it all off! Either you do it or I'll do it for you!*

I clearly remember shaking and cutting my hair. She made me clean the bathroom, explain to my dad that I had made a mess of my hair and had to do this and apologize for it.

She convinced my dad not to let me go on a 3-day school trip because she thought I must be grounded for a month because I had stolen her wifi password. Her stupid 0000 wifi password. She said that I couldn't be trusted, and how could my dad let me go on this trip? So, I was grounded and not allowed to go - and I was the ONLY freshman not there.

She took my phone and only gave it back when I called my mom crying about it and she had to have a fight with dad from across the world. Finally, my dad decided my phone was out of the question.

The worst thing, aside from the hair, was when my friends and I decided to go to a party when I was 16. We got ready at our place, and were just leaving when she stopped us yelling and screaming.

*Why would you think it's ok to leave my house looking like a whore? get back here!*

And then she dragged me back to the house and pushed me to my room, legit attacked me and took off my clothes and made me wipe off my make-up and change into something else. My friends were frozen out of fear, I came out looking beaten (she didn't actually hit me, though) and miserable and crying. I just told them to just go - and we all ran out of that house. I was humiliated. I wanted to die. My friends didn't know what to do. One of them asked if she always treated me like that. ""What a bitch""

That night, she came into my room to let me know she only did that because she cares about my dad and what he thinks of her. Also that she doesn't want her son to see these things at his age!

She did that a lot. Randomly talking to me about what a great person she was and how wise she was. Once she sat me down to tell me I was acting out and that she knew I was a good girl deep down, but trying to fight her and that it was natural. She made me feel crazy and ungrateful. She would play the victim constantly. My dad was barely there, much like before, but when he was - he was yelling at me because she'd told him I was nothing but trouble.

She broke my spirit. I was too tired to fight her. I gave up fighting her, I just legit gave up. When I told these to my therapist, he said that abuse is exactly like this. They close a door on you, but don't teach you how to open another one... so you're just lost. I needed someone to love me, to pay attention, to tell me I was doing a good job getting straight A's in school. Instead, I got constant yelling and criticism and guilt.

I'm 26 years old now... and I've just realized what this monster has done to me. She's the reason my life is miserable now. I wasn't a bad kid. I wasn't a trouble maker. I was just a teenager, and this woman made it her mission to break me and she did. My dad never married her, and I have no idea what's happened to her. I've also never told my mom. I mean, she knew that I was having ""trouble"" but I never told her my side of the story.

I don't know how I'm going to overcome this, but I'm done feeling like the victim. I now know why I'm no longer happy and care-free and energetic. I know exactly when things changed. I'm the same person, I just had a door closed on my face and nobody showed me how to open another one. I'm gonna build one and walk through it now. Fuck you, C. I hope you get what you deserve. I'm sure she kept telling herself she was being ""responsible"" or that was her job - but all she had to do was NOT ruin some kid's life.

IMPORTANT EDIT: I just need to say this, since this is getting some reads... Please please please if you just don't feel good - that doesn't necessarily mean sad or angry, it could just be ""out of it"" - try and find the reason for it. I've tried for years. I've been in therapy since I was 17, and I started cutting myself. I used to think it was because of guys, or because of my parents' divorce, or because of x and y and... I only realized what this was all about when I told my therapist that the last time I was truly happy was when I was 15. He made me write about every single year of my life, and we went through it like a TV show and figured out what exactly happened. I didn't even think of this woman for much of my adult life. But now, everything's a lot clearer. So - just please talk to someone. Write. Writing is incredible, and it doesn't even cost anything. But if you write and talk to someone who knows what to look for - that's what matters. ","That sucks that you went through all that, but I’m glad you now realize it was abuse and are getting the help you need.

I never realized, never had any idea actually, that my ex was emotionally abusive, and how much of a toll it took on me and on my mental health until I went to therapy.

Please listen to what she had to say about mental illness: 'I also don't accept it that one should feel ashamed because he/she is suffering from a mental illness…everyone could be affected, no matter if he/she has a cheerful personality or not…I'm aware that \[I have\] a chronic disease and it belongs to your life but fortunately you can live with it.'

She was a warrior. She exuded warmth and light. She saved my life.

I have suffered from OCD, anxiety, and depression for 9 years. It has taken so much from me, but this loss was particularly cruel.

I believe I am speaking through Annika when I ask you to please stay. Please fight for your life. You matter. I love you. It does get better.

I am also first-generation, and I have experienced the stigma surrounding mental illness in my community firsthand. But in this particular moment, I feel peace and love. I could not have imagined that on my darkest day. Your fight is valid and you are strong; please reject anything that suggests otherwise. Please take strength from Annika's words and my journey. Please carry on with the hope that she instilled in me. This life can still be beautiful for you.

And now, I ask that you please help me honor this beautiful soul.

Annika said, 'I admired and adored \[Avril Lavigne\] so much when I was a teenager, her music literally saved me back then.' She had a ticket for Avril’s concert in Germany—it would have been her second time—but it was cancelled due to COVID.

If you have Twitter, please help me reach Avril by retweeting my post with a comment, tagging **Avril Lavigne** and **The Avril Foundation**. My Twitter handle, if the link doesn't work, is simply 'libbyredda'. I've pinned the tweet.

If you do not have Twitter, please post an Instagram story with a screenshot of the tweet and tag the same accounts.

And if you have any other suggestions or connections, let’s use them too!

Please help me do one last special thing for Annika. Your support means everything to me.

Annika deserved every drop of magic in this world. And you do too :) Please let her witness this from wherever she is watching us.

Thank you with all my heart. Keep fighting, my warriors! Annika and I believe in you!”",I'm sorry for your loss :( stay strong friends,461,7,8/19/2020 7:08,icixvp
mentalhealth,"This is a battle I’m going to fight until the end. If I die, I’m going to die on my feet. My memory and appetite might be quickly declining, (as evidenced by neuropsychological tests). But I’m not going to die quietly.","My body still works and I’m going to keep exercising. I’m going to eat healthy and even though I don’t feel like eating, I’m going to force myself to eat. I’m going to fight this depression and fight to stay alive.","YOU GO OP!!💜More power to you!!

mentalhealth,Is it rude to tell people my dad died by suicide?,"My dad used a handgun and ended his life recently. I’ve found myself having to tell people my dad died a lot, but I am increasingly wanting to be honest with how it happened. Instead of saying “my dad died suddenly and unexpectedly,” I want to tell people “my dad died from suicide.”

This feels important to me. If we are more open about suicide, about mental health, maybe fewer dads or siblings or friends will die this way. 

I mentioned it to a coworker today who, after I said it, was suddenly in a rush to get off the phone with me. I feel bad for shocking him and don’t hold it against him if he didn’t want to talk to me anymore after that, but I don’t want to hide how my dad died and I want people to know suicide is a real possibility for some.",[deleted],454,57,4/7/2020 17:08,fwo8vr
mentalhealth,I've started talking to myself the way I talk to friends,"I'm so tired of being sensitive all the time. I get really hard on myself about it. I care too much what other people think. I take things that are otherwise innocuous to heart. And I'm logically *aware* of it, and yet, feel like no matter how much therapy I attend or how much self-help I try to apply, it just won't go away. I know I'm making slow progress, but I get really frustrated at myself when I'm too emotional to take a step back and acknowledge the big picture.

So recently I've started talking to myself *out loud,* the same way I talk to friends. ""It's okay to be sad, my love,"" or ""you get to be frustrated, lovebug, you're human,"" and what the hell it works *so* well. I'm not saying all my problems have gone away, but for 1) using sweet petnames for myself makes it feel like, sincerely, it's coming from someone else and 2) I trust what I'm saying because I know that if I were talking to a friend in my position those are things I would legitimately say and articulate to someone feeling the way I am.","Oh that's a really good idea!! I've been doing something similar when asking my friends for input, especially over text. Instead of reading it how I would write to myself, I imagine my friends saying it to me and it feels better!",455,27,10/30/2020 0:41,jkmox2

I specifically felt like sharing because when I woke up, I ALMOST let myself waste away in bed all day, but I just knew I'd already had too many of those days.

mentalhealth,Does anyone feel dramatic/like a giant burden after they start talking about their emotions?,"I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit for this, so im sorry if it isnt the right place, but ive recently noticed out of all my acquaintances, when they rant it makes them feel better. but for me, it just feels selfish and like my emotions aren't worth as much. so this makes it hard to ever release my emotions. how/why does this occur, and why am I the only one out of everyone ive talked to that experiences this? thx :)","Always. Every single time I open up with my true feelings. I’ll wonder why I just did that? Unload my emotions. I’ll also feel the strong urge to apologize to whomever I’m talking to, wondering if I shared too much or if what I shared was too...emotional or intimate.

mentalhealth,"Do you ever feel like you're just so, so starved for human connection","That like even when you're with people, 99 % of the time you're not really there and something in your heart is resisting you from being fully yourself? 

So that you cannot ever fully relax into your being and instead are always as if holding yourself up somewhere outside of your body, always psychically hanging on a ledge of fear?

That Even when you're on your own and can be yourself youre still not really ""your self?""

This is how ive felt for as long as i can remember. The times when it didn't feel this way in my life have been as few and far between as sunshine on a cloudy day.

I feel fucked up somehow, like this isn't what human life is supposed to feel like. I can't imagine why human beings would exist to feel this way. It feels criminal.

The only times that I feel OK are when I'm stoned, like right now. And - rarely- when very comfortable with friends in a loving home environment. I never felt like this once while I was living with my parents.

I gave up a lot to feel better, I even quit my job and left everything behind on a spiritual journey, and yet after a lot of (enjoyable) adventures I still feel the same. Like life is just a movie playing in front of my eyes, as though a dream which I have no will over. I never felt in control of my life, really. I have always been along for the ride of whatever my impulses tell me. Sometimes they boss me in positive directions and sometimes negative but at the end of the day I still feel like I'm only holding on to the reins of my life which is living itself. I don't stand up for myself when verbally attacked, I just go silent and dumb. I've never been able to release myself completely to romantic love, just half way, never committing to anything that concrete, just like I've lived my life.

I don't know why I'm posting this, it's just a strange little thing, that now I finally feel okay, because I'm stoned, that this would come out. That a healthier part of my is crying out for some help because it's never expressed and always imprisoned behind this sort of crystalline, blurred window that seperates me from the life around me.

Idk. Does anyone relate? Is this something that happens?","No I totally relate to this, and I always kick myself after a meet up like “why did you do that?”",448,31,6/11/2020 22:29,h784wh

mentalhealth,Does anyone else just want to sleep to escape reality,"My first post on Reddit. (39M)

I have always been of strong character and hard working, people who know me would say I'm life and soul, funny, intelligent and strong. Recently though I've found myself slipping into a routine of staying up late and sleeping all day and being lazy. I cocoon myself in my duvet and wrap a pillow around my head and try to sleep as long as possible. I can wake momentarily and remember my dreams quite vividly (they are always enjoyable happy dreams) I can then just remember the dream and slip back into them. 

It's like I'm addicted to my dreams and as soon as I wake I try and try to enter back into that world. Sometimes I'm successful but after 12 hours sadly I am in the real world. 

I am in danger of losing my job because of this now which worries me even more. It's quite apparent that I must be depressed. I have so much to be grateful for but it appears the big D has taken over my life. Can I regain my normal life? This is the first time I've ever spoke about it to anyone, probably the wrong place to seek help, I have no idea. I need to sort my sh*t out before I lose my job and subsequently my house then I shall be at rock bottom.",I relate so much to this.,452,34,1/7/2020 15:51,eld9uc
mentalhealth,"You don't need to ""make the most"" of this global pandemic","I was doing some research for a project about Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs when I got to thinking about how many people I know who are struggling because they expected their creative output to increase with the ""free"" time quarantine has allotted them. But, this isn't just ""free"" time. Our ""safety"" need has been completely compromised, so it makes sense that creation or feeling a sense of purpose is difficult. There's a reason safety is structured near the bottom of the period. It's fine if you want to pass the time creating, if you find escapism in art, but be patient with yourself if you can't. This isn't a vacation, this is a crisis. Take care of your needs. Take care of yourself.","It’s a weird old time, at the beginning I thought I’d do art projects and jigsaws and stuff... that didn’t happen, I’ve been doing my best trying to stay motivated working from home.. that is kinda happening because it kinda has to to pay me... life is very weird right now for all of us, for every single one of us... so yeah, if you make art to cope or indeed to pay the bills I applaud you, if you have a weird ass office job like me that isn’t an essential service but keeps the wheels of the economy turning then hey ho, whoop de doo... yeah, big wake up call... I am honestly trying but it feels like why bother... so yeah, on my days off, and when I need to take a break from it all.:: I WILL try hard to create and make art and write in a creative way... no judgement here, it’s all very very hard and weird xxx",445,22,5/8/2020 20:58,gg1ja4
mentalhealth,Dear mentally stable people: I’m not lazy!,"I’m posting this here because I just want to know if anyone else feels this way. I’m not lazy! I know it looks like I’m lazy. I sleep all day, I never join the family to eat or watch a movie, I spend all of my time in my room. I failed my classes, although I used to get straight A’s. I never go out anymore, I haven’t hung out with any of my friends in months. I don’t even walk my dogs. Or at least that’s just what it looks like right?

I’m not lazy. I hate it here. I’m miserable, my mind is in constant pain. Everything feels so heavy and difficult. Why do I have to participate in a life that just causes me so much pain? Why do I have to get a job, when doing so causes a massive downward spiral in my mental health? Why do I need to keep going to school when it makes me feel totally and utterly filled with dread and fear? Other people want me here more than I do. 

I feel like most people are given a shiny, fun, new toy, and some of us are given old dusty broken shit from the thrift store. And they wonder why we won’t just “play with it, live a little, have fun! Be happy with what you’ve got! Enjoy it!”  Like, I’m sorry for hating it. I’m sorry for hating my life. I’m sorry my brain doesn’t do shiny, fun, cool things, and it resembles the broken toy a bit more. People who have never experienced serious mental health issues have no idea what it’s like for us. If their toy gets a scratch, they can polish it. My toy is way too broken to even bother trying to polish it. It’s so invalidating and exhausting to even exist near people who don’t understand because I can feel the constant judgement. 

When normal people feel sad, they can watch a movie or call a friend to cheer themselves up. And it genuinely works for them. I can’t escape the brokenness of my mind even when I’m “happy”. It’s always there, and I can always feel it no matter what. Lately, the weight has been too heavy to bear. So I know it looks like it, but I promise I’m not lazy. I’m just trying to stay afloat.","You described it very well! Whenever I call in to one of those crisis centers because I am really struggling and also feel alone, they love ending the conversation with so what are some things you're going to do to distract yourself? What have you done in the past that has helped you? 

Do they think if that stuff helped I would have been on the phone with a stranger?

I hope you feel free to post here whenever you need people to hear you. It is so hard to feel anguish and have everyone not able to see it and almost resent you for being a killjoy. 

Sorry for talking about me a lot. I just could resonate a lot with what you were saying.",446,23,4/19/2020 20:47,g4f4sj
mentalhealth,I stop replying to people for no reason,"When I talk with someone for a while I suddenly don't want to reply to them anymore for no reason. Most of the times people don't do anything to upset me or make me want to stop talking to them. The simplest way I can describe how I feel when I see a message and my brain goes ""nope"" is boredom. It's not like I don't care about these people, if they got hurt or something happened to them I would feel bad, but...I just don't reply to them. When I do that I don't even feel bad, what's wrong with me? I know I care about them, but apparently it's not enugh for me to feel the urge to talk with them.

Edit: When I stop replying this goes on for several months, until I feel the urge to talk to someone again, and I don't have the guts to text someone again after ignoring them for so much time when I wasn't even feeling bad or anything.","oh my gosh i’ve never related to anything more, i always thought i was the only one!

mentalhealth,"I tried so hard to love this country, but after all of the racism and indifference I’ve faced, I’m happy I can finally leave.","I’m from an Indian (India not Native American) family. They were born in India, but I was born here in the United States. I’ve lived here in the Southeast for my whole life. I’ve always faced so much racism. I’ve been called a terrorist for my skin color more times than I can remember. 

The media so often uses us as the butt of jokes (looking at you Disney Channel) and even some politicians do too. Joe Biden made a joke about Indians being gas station owners (my parents are lawyers with American accents). Nobody cares though. I’m just expected to suck it up. 

I tried so hard to look at the bright side. To look at how much opportunity and financial success this country has provided, and that is something I will always be very grateful for. I tried so hard to love this nation, but I just can’t. I’ve been told to “go home” by some people. Despite being born here and living here my whole life, I’ll never be seen as a true American. 

Despite that I just can’t stand it any more. It’s not the racism so much, but the indifference and invalidation. That’s the real depressive thing. 

Anyway, this isn’t to say that all Americans are like this. I’ve met plenty of fantastic ones who understand and sympathize, but there are just too many of the bad apples in this country for me to want to stay. 

I was lucky enough to intern in, and get a full time job in London. I’m so ecstatic to move there. The fact that I’m ethnically Indian won’t be my defining factor there like it is here. At least there I’ll be “the American” and not “the Indian.” 

Systemic Barriers like racial preferences in college admissions don’t exist at top universities like they do here. I went to college at UVA, and while it was leagues better than high school in terms of overt racism, the invalidation and indifference of overt racism toward ethnic Indians was still 100% there. So if I have kids, they’ll grow up in a country where their skin color isn’t their defining factor. 

I don’t mean to offend anyone with this soapbox. If you’re an American who gets what I’m saying, then thank you, and I am grateful that people like you exist. I acknowledge you and will never lump you in with the other people alluded to.","I agree with you very much, and I’m glad you are able to move to a place that you feel more comfortable. You deserve to be happy, and if the U.S. isn’t that place, there are tons of other places that might! I understand what you mean about the United States, I see it all the time.

Yesterday I took myself to urgent care (by bus), called a dentist to see me for X-rays the next day (for free despite having no dental insurance), and then I agreed to have my wisdom tooth removed on the spot (scary). Already, my pain is completely gone.



I’m in my (very) late twenties and have never made any kind of appointment for myself without my mom’s help before this due to my extreme anxiety. I have been doing an outpatient psychiatric program for months (which she also got me into) that has been helping me take little steps when I can.



So many of the things I had to do yesterday would’ve completely thrown me just a few weeks ago. I can’t remember ever feeling so competent and independent. I would say a lot of it was purely born of desperation from the pain in my mouth, but I’m proud of myself anyway (and mom is too).



This feels like a huge milestone to me so I thought I’d share.",It'll now be easier the next time you have to do something like this. Confidence grows with experience. Glad you're bettering yourself.,427,28,11/22/2020 15:28,jyxf1h
mentalhealth,I called a helpline for the first time tonight,"I called the Samaritans (UK) on 116 123 for the first time tonight. 

I spoke to a wonderful volunteer called James. I said I didn't really know how it works and he just said ""It's simple, you talk and I listen"" he reassured me that they can't give advice. They won't tell you not to cut and they won't call the police unless they seriously need to, they also can't see your number. They can simply listen and offer an ear. I spoke calmly about my struggles and my life and he listened for like half an hour. I honestly nearly cried he was so reassuring and spent so long with me even though I wasn't in desperate need. I came away feeling a lot better and promised to call next time i feel like cutting.

I've never called a helpline before as I thought it would be very scripted but he just got me talking about family, my partner, my house and other things. Really got my mind out of a bad place so honestly just give it a go. The worst that can happen is you feel no better

Thank you James",Love this! Reaching out is SO HARD but once you do it can be so worth it!!!,425,17,12/30/2020 22:18,knc7p2
mentalhealth,Does anyone ever get depressed because they feel average?,"My whole life I’ve been average. Average looks, intelligence, social life ect. There’s just nothing special about me.

How do you get over the feeling of being average ?

I’m taking the time to read each of them, because it makes me feel better to hear what you have to say and that I’m not alone in feeling this way.",All the time my guy. It’s one of the reasons my depression is currently really bad. It always feels like whatever it is I’m doing everyone else is far better at it. There is a little mantra I repeat that helps me a little bit with it though - being a jack of all trades and master of none is still better than being a master of one. Maybe it’ll help you a little bit too :),429,57,10/28/2020 3:43,jjgp1u

mentalhealth,"If you were abused or felt unloved, unwanted, unheard or hated yourself as a child, please read this.","This is for anyone who was abused as a child.

I wrote this when I had a revelation about myself. I knew I've been depressed my whole life. I knew I had severe anxiety and I hated myself more than words can explain. But I thought it was completely my fault - that I was a broken person. I thought I would never heal. I thought nobody would ever understand me. I just recently realized that my childhood abuse has completely shaped who I am as an adult. I never before made the connection between my childhood abuse and who I am today. It wasn't simply just a ""chemical imbalance; end of story"". You may not have experienced anything even remotely similar to what I have, but I hope after reading this some of you will start thinking and start seeing connections to your inner abused child that is still suffering from what happened to you in the past.
(Please google CPTSD if you haven't already heard of it.)

I'm gonna vent about this because I know I'm not the only one. This is something that I just recently realized and it takes a lot of weight off my shoulders to finally know why I am the way I am. This was really an eye opener for me. This is my story. *TW*

The worst part about child abuse is for a lot of us, we are too young to understand that we're even being abused. Especially in terms of emotional abuse. We don't know any different. We grew up being treated like this, and we know something doesn't feel right, but we decide it must be a problem with us. ""We accept the love we think we deserve."" 
Thankfully I did know that the physical abuse I was receiving was not okay, but honestly it took me 24 years to fully realize that I was emotionally abused as a child. 24 YEARS.

I was emotionally and physically abused by my parents and other family members (mostly my mother) starting as a very very young child, possibly infant. Of course as a child you are incapable of understanding that you are not to blame. Because of this, I believed that I was broken, horrible, and stupid. I thought something was wrong with me. Why else would my parents not love me? In my own eyes I had to be at fault. Something was wrong with me. Even as a preschooler and kindergartener I have memories of thinking ""why do I have to be me?"" and ""what's wrong with me?"". My self esteem was non-existent. 

I remember going to my pediatric doctor due to a skin infection I had as a kindergartener. I had to see this doctor weekly, and because she was so kind to me (as a doctor should be, or any adult honestly) I started to see her as a parent figure. She made me feel loved and safe when my own mother did not. I remember I brought her a picture of me that we got from school picture day. She told my parents that I must have asperger's because of how socially awkward I was and how I acting around her (the doctor.) This later proved to be false, but again added to my feeling that I was broken and bad. We stopped seeing that doctor and my parents were furious at me. Why was it not clear to this doctor that I was insecurely attached?

My self esteem and hatred towards myself only got worse as time went on, and by 4th grade I was having full on almost passing out panic attacks. Started as hypochondria, but quickly became social anxiety. I could NOT function in school because I felt so uncomfortable in my own skin. Nobody wanted to be my friend. Nobody cared about me. The teachers HATED me. And then at home, nobody loved me. When people would look at me I wanted to just disappear. I made myself believe that I was incapable of making friends or being likable which in turn basically made me be unlikable. Ironic. Nobody wanted to be around me because my anxiety made me very awkward. I viewed myself as lesser than everyone else which would follow me into adulthood. Eventually I could not talk in front of the class. If I even knew I had to say a single word in front of the class or have everyone look at me I would literally run out of the room. Complete full on flight mode. Instead of being diagnosed with ANXIETY, I was diagnosed with ADHD. I couldn't focus because I was probably always disassociating. School was not the most important thing in my mind because at both at home and at school I was trying to survive. Why on earth would school be the first thing on my mind? 

Of course I fell behind in school and struggled to keep up with assignments which in turn made me feel even more stupid. When they had psychologists coming in to my classroom to study me, it only worsened my hatred towards myself. ""They're only watching me and studying me because there's something wrong with me."" I started seeing the school psychologist, therapist and social worker weekly. I was put into remedial classes and on an IEP. I was placed in some classes with children with severe behavioral and intellectual disabilities. I was forced to take IQ tests. In 6th grade I was literally forced to STACK BLOCKS while a psychologist watched. I'll never forget seeing the notes the psychologist wrote after that. ""Lots of nervous laughter."" No shit. I'm 12 and you're having me stack 5 blocks in a specific pattern. This is after they found out I had an average IQ, mind you. Everything that they did, whether they were trying to help or not, made me feel worse about myself. ""Why can't I be like the regular kids?"" is all that went through my brain. Every single thing that happened to me only solidified the belief in my head that something was wrong with me.

I was embarrassed of my own existence.

When I'd go home and try to explain that I would shake and be so scared that I couldn't even think straight in school my parents would just scream at me. I remember getting punched in the stomach and told to suck it up after just trying to explain what was going on. I had no one to turn to. 

By 7th grade I could not go to school. If I knew I'd have to work with other students or even be looked at in front of the class I would skip school. And honestly, it wasn't that school itself was a problem. I liked school itself. I couldn't function with my low self esteem and hatred towards myself. I constantly felt singled out. I felt bad that other people even had to look at me. I was too young to put this into words, and all I was able to say to anyone about what was going on was that talking in front of the class makes me scared and shakey. 

After I started getting in trouble for missing so much school (after the school social worker and principal drove to my house to talk to my parents and do a wellness check on my family), I went with extreme measures. Even running away from home and hiding which ended up with the police looking for me. All because I didn't want to have to panic. I tried to explain my anxiety in the best way a child can without even understanding what anxiety is. I was treated like a delinquent child instead.
Ended up in court after missing hundreds of days of school and had to do weeks of community service. AT 12 YEARS OLD.

I was showing so many signs of an abused child and I had definitely brought up my family physical abuse multiple times to adults at school and nobody heard me. Nobody. I was not a delinquent. I was suffering so noticeably yet somehow nobody noticed. 

By high school I refused to wear my glasses so I wouldn't have to see people looking at me in the hallway. I was still in remedial classes all those years later, which were mostly for kids with behavioral issues.  Kids that would kick, fight, scream, do drugs, you name it - this was not me at all.  I think I gave up trying to speak out because I tried so many times and I couldn't get anyone to hear me. I ended up dropping out of high school.

Fast forward to three years ago when I was going to pursue my dream of studying and then hopefully teaching abroad in Japan. Saved up for three years for my student visa and relearned everything from the ground up to get my GED. Did both things, got accepted and started my Japanese school in Tokyo. Never in my life had I been so proud of myself. I didn't even believe I was capable of accomplishing anything in my life. The moment that plane landed I cried my first ever happy tears.

Two weeks into language school, we were going around the table of probably 20 other students learning verbs at a very fast pace. I remember time slowing down while I was waiting for it to be my turn, then I blacked out. When I came to I ran out of the classroom. I left school and walked around Tokyo sobbing. I had gotten that far and somehow completely forgot how bad my self esteem and anxiety are. My dreams completely clouded out the truth. I knew I couldn't continue with school so I dropped out, then impulsively blew all of my tuition money that I saved for years on bullshit. After coming home I hit rock bottom and was hospitalized. Once again, the belief that I was broken was renewed in my mind.

At the hospital I was told ""you're not severe enough for inpatient treatment"". The doctor spent a total of maybe 4 minutes with me. Asked me a couple questions, checked me for head injuries, and left. I went to the hospital because I knew that if I went back home I was going to end my life. I was so used to stuffing my emotions down into myself at this point in my life that even if I was on the edge of ending it all - I looked calm. I even explained to them this. After waiting 6 hours after seeing the doctor, they sent me to a place thats only purpose was to keep you from harming yourself. Great, but when I went back home I learned nothing. No coping skills, didn't talk to a single mental health professional, nothing. I was back at square one. I reached out for help for the first time as an adult and was again, failed.

Inside my head was still the once tiny little girl wondering, ""what is wrong with me?""

Memories of my childhood were again, flashing back. I sat in my room for months. I couldn't leave the house. I had no desire to exist. I ripped up every baby photo I had with my mother in them. I honestly thought I wouldn't live another year. I was going to end up killing myself. I lost all of my hope.

Now, a couple years after that I'm finally now just getting the real help I need. I had to be the one to keep reaching out. It was very hard, but I am so glad I did. I had to keep picking myself back up, again and again; If I hadn't I would not be alive. I'm so glad that I chose to fight for my life. I searched for a long time for a good psychiatrist and therapist. I finally found someone who heard me. I have even been able to forgive people who abused me. Of course I still and always will have scars, but now I am able to cope with them. 
I now know I am not broken. I am a survivor and I have been and was just trying to survive. People are now shocked when I tell them I have ""social anxiety."" Eventually I will go back to Japan when I am actually ready. 

Learning about CPTSD and realizing WHY I am the way I am has been extremely important to me. Just like I'm finally connecting the dots. I'm finally starting to love myself. The little girl that once felt so unloved is finally healing. 

I encourage all of you to learn how your trauma affects you, and know that you can also heal from it. 💕 I hope someone out there will read this and feel like there is hope. I truly hope this inspired someone out there that is in an awful place like I once was. Do not give up on yourself.

Please remember: You're not broken. You're surviving.

The cycle of abuse ends with us!",Thank you. I did not go through everything you went through but I can relate to many parts. I have social anxiety too and I am now able to give small group presentations. You will go back to Japan and thrive.,420,27,2/24/2020 2:28,f8kars
mentalhealth,Threw out a self harm tool.,"Today I threw out an object that I knew I could hurt myself badly with. It was extremely hard, but I did it. 

I’ve been self harming since 2014, however, i’ve gotten clean and relapsed many times since then.

mentalhealth,Was anyone else called a spoiled brat growing up (or anything close to that) but now realize it was a mixture of poor parenting and undiagnosed mental health issues?,"TLDR at the bottom. 


Growing up, my mood was unpredictable. It was a constant state of anger, immaturity, anxiety, and fear. My parents gave me stuff I wanted but were pretty ignorant when it came to my mental health issues. They thought I would outgrow my behaviors or treat me the same way they treated my brothers. Thinking about it now, numerous reg flags were there. I was very defiant and scared of a lot of things. Many of them irrational. I remember being in like junior high and my mother telling me to get something from the car while we were at a family friends party. It was dark already and I took one look outside, saw the car parked across the street and got scared. Idk of what but my mind told me to be scared. I asked my friend to come with me but she didn’t want to and I think she was scared too because it was dark. I go back to my mom who is talking to her friends and tell her I’m scared and “(friend) doesn’t want to go with me.  I don’t want to go to the car” (friends mom was in the circle of friends like 10 of them and I was hoping she would make her go with me (I know subtle tattletale, in junior high too...currently cringing)) and my mom ended up going with me to the car. I didn’t think much of this but the next day my dad told me that one of the parents called me a spoiled brat as soon as I left with my mom to the car. Looking back I should have told my mom personally but I didn’t think it would matter since the people we were surrounded by were childhood friends who knew me at a young age. 

Growing up in my house was overall not good emotionally. Lots of instability with my father’s moods and sometimes my mother’s. I ended up being a rude child and would get angrily reprimanded by my parents (sometimes physically even if it didn’t hurt...it still did...if that makes sense). I remember saying goodbye to my parents friends (at their friends house) by just waving the off in an “eh” manner (I tried to be cute and joke with them...also I was half tired) my parents pushed me to hug them and kiss them (cultural thing) but I was just like “meh” and didn’t. I didn’t realize I was embarrassing my parents and their friends. I came off as rude. I was like 12 or 13 at the time. As soon as we got into the car my dad exploded in anger and shouted at me to never do that again. He said this while also putting his fist to my knee banging on my knee every time I didn’t give a coherent “yes” to him when he told me to never act that way again. I was in tears. I really didn’t think anything of my actions. Looking back, yeah it is rude of me but I don’t think they was the correct parental way to go about things. 

There were many instances like this. Where I would come off rude and anxious especially when I didn’t get my way with things. Forcing my friends to play with me when they didn’t want to. Telling on them to their older siblings hoping they would make their sibling play with me only to be told “she doesn’t want to play with you. That’s not my problem”, picking fights with my siblings, screaming and shouting loud enough that the neighbors can hear me... 

I was recently diagnosed with BPD, PTSD, and ADHD. In addition to my MDD, OCD, and GAD. I feel like a light just switched on this year and made me go “oh wow I really wasn’t a normal kid”.

tldr: to a lot of people growing up I came off as an annoying and rude immature brat but after analyzing a lot of my behaviors and my upbringing as an adult, I now realize it was possibly a mixture of poor parenting and undiagnosed mental health issues.","Not exactly those phrases but I empathize with you. I've always been described as 'too much' 'a bulldozer' 'sensitive, too emotional' but I sympathize with what you're feeling because my parents were mentally ill and not good parents at all.

mentalhealth,Stop over-emoting at funerals and stop burdening children with adult emotions.,"As a kid, no one ever showed stronger emotion or openly cared about anyone unless they were in the hospital or at their funeral. 

I never realized how that manifested my suicidal thoughts. I’ve wanted to die for the smallest things since I was in 4th grade. After doing some personal development, I realized that my need to be cared for was always associated with hurt, sickness, and other people were responsible to make me feel cared for. 

Teach children that they’re loved & their thoughts matter. Death or sickness is not the only way to feel cared for. I now know why I always want to die. If your loved ones will only care once you’re dead, what’s the point of living? 

Lets teach our kids better. Love, belonging , and happiness is not achieved through hurt.","I would have thought the solution would be to show emotions at all occasions rather than only at funerals. My grandfather, a super strong man, cried both at my grandmothers funeral and my graduation.

mentalhealth,Why does my (20m) mind immediately default to suicide when something bad happens to me?,"(I meant 20F and now I can't change the title)

I am very prone to spiralling, or snowballing, when something bad happens to me. 

Recently, I've been getting into arguments with my mum and it's been making me feel like shit. She tells me I'm brainwashed, makes me feel stupid, and a lot more. When I brought it up to her she denied the lot and the only apology I got was a 'sorry you feel that way' 

This isn't something small, I don't think, but i also feel as though I'm overreacting, but that just makes me feel worse, and so the spiral begins.

And it always ends with a 'you should just kill yourself'. Almost always followed with a 'no you retard thats a bad idea' 

Because other than little things like that, my life is fine. I have friends, a loving partner (long distance atm), a roof over my head and hot meals. I'm fine. Yet I'm not. And, again, it makes me feel worse that there are people who have it so, so badly, and yet I have the audacity to feel the way I do?

I do not want to bring any of this up to my mother. She would just gaslight me again. My partner knows, though, and is as supportive as he can be in the current situation. That's all I can ask for, right?

Edit: thank you all for the advice and help. I'll try to take it on board =).","At the risk of insulting your intelligence, I would like to point out that you already know why; you just don't like the reason. [This may help](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobo_doll_experiment); also, [this](http://changingminds.org/explanations/behaviors/ta.htm). You've internalized your mother's, er, tactlessness and lack of empathy. You're self-punishing, but she isn't showing appreciation for that. The logical conclusion of that journey is for you to commit punitive suicide.

If you'll forgive my candor, I should like to reassure you that *pain is pain*. You're miserable, you're being mistreated, and the plight of some other person in some other country isn't strictly relevant to your life, any more than your suffering is relevant to theirs. As soon as you're living in a healthy environment, surrounded by people who respect you, then perhaps you can spare the emotional energy to fight for the rights of others. Right now, it's OK to focus on taking care of yourself. It isn't selfish. It's *self-care.* If you don't do it, who will?

You're allowed to feel guilty for wanting to take care of yourself or for being unhappy with your life. That's OK. You don't have to apologize to anyone else for how you feel. We may be judged by our actions, but our feelings are our own business, and if someone told you that you have to justify what goes on inside your own head, they lied to you.

Why do you feel shitty? You feel shitty because your mother is being shitty.

Why do you feel guilty about feeling shitty? It's because she taught you that your feelings don't matter.

Why do you find it hard to avoid spiraling? It's because your support system isn't living with you, whereas your toxic mother *is*.

You know what you have to do, and you know how to do it. You don't need me (or anyone else) to tell you how to solve this problem. You already know how to solve it. Once you've moved out, you'll be able to put some space between you and the source of all this toxicity.",415,25,6/21/2020 2:23,hcyyak
mentalhealth,Is it normal to talk to yourself?,"I often find myself having full on conversations with myself or even made up people to get my thoughts straight, sometimes I make up whole scenarios where I apply what I learn in life and give a bunch of advice to a bunch of imaginary people, and I’m not even sure why i do it, but I do it a lot and it sometimes lasts a whole hour of me talking alone by myself in my room and i feel like if somebody saw me one day they’ll think im crazy... in my head i’m having full on discussions but on the outside i probably just look like i’m whispering and mumbling nonsense","same, thank fuck im not alone in doing that lol",413,80,4/29/2020 23:36,gakhhq
mentalhealth,The cost for inpatient mental health treatment is fucking shameful.,"The average daily cost to be treated at a mental health facility, if you are uninsured,  is $1,000 per day.

The elite truly DO NOT GIVE A FLYING FUCK about the lower classes.","The only thing keeping me out of rehab right now is the cost. I had a buddy do 3 WEEKS.

mentalhealth,I think I was/am an unintentionally toxic person and its torturing me,"To be honest I barely have any friends. I generally can't hold down friendships for longer than a year or so.


I know that I kind of default to negativity when I'm talking so that might factor into it, I can be a little too honest sometimes, I genuinely try not to be one of those ""im not mean, you just can't handle the truth"" people, but I'm scared that I come across as really mean.


I can't get over the mistakes of my past, where I did or said mean things in the heat of the moment, or when I did or said things that were cringy or stupid.

Sometimes I feel like I might have been toxic because I sometimes default to sadness when I wanted attention from others. I put myself down a lot, now I realize I do that so people would lift me up and I would feel good (sometimes people would agree with me tho lmao). I hate that i did that and some people might potentially see me as a manipulator, even if I hate that and wouldn't consciously seek to do that...


I want to change, and I hope I have, but I'm scared I'll always be a shitty, negative person who sucks the energy out of the room and casts a shadow on everything.


How can you change your nature as a negative person and be better? Have you done this?

Thanks for listening!","Firstly, you’ve admitted you think this of yourself. That takes guts and shows you’re not generally a negative person, instead you’ve been treated badly and think this is how the world really is. 

I suggest cognitive behavioural therapy and meditation to start creating positive associations with yourself. Once you are able to self love your perspective will begin to change. 

You don’t deserve to carry something that has nothing to do with who you really are and you definitely don’t deserve to put yourself down.

mentalhealth,How many people are we going to lose to suicide due to this quarantine?,"I've noticed a lot of people around me are suffering from huge anxiety and depression from being stuck indoors all day. Luckily my anxiety and depressions are basically cured, so I try my best to help those around me mentally.



But it got me thinking. What about those who can't get help and end up doing something drastic. Do you think that's a consequence no one has addressed?","I got closer to killing myself in the last week than I have gotten in nearly 7 years. I pulled through, but it is was too close for comfort. I don’t think I will ever actually kill myself, but I am starting to lose my mind, and I could very well hurt myself in other ways. I don’t know how much more of this I am going to be able to handle before I fall off the deep end and I don’t know how long it will take for me to crawl out of the whole. I realized I was nearing a point of crisis and I needed help, and tried to get in to see a therapist, but everyone is only offering “telehealth”. It’s better than nothing, but god, I wish I could just sit and talk with someone, and not feel so alone. For now, I take it day by day.

I found out about my illness on my own about 3 years later at age 15. 

I was mad because they kept it a secret from me for 3 years. It was 3 long years. I was very mad when I knew the truth because they lied. They did not come clean with me, I found out myself.

I could not accept my own illness. On the day I realized I had it, it was a total breakdown being unable to accept the reality.  I found out about my own illness when I went online to find out what my medication is for. I thought it was PTSD at first. 

I felt like a fool. They said it was too hard to tell me the truth because I was so young at that time. They could not accept that I had Schizophrenia at age 12. How do you think parents should go about breaking the news to a young child?","It’s a really difficult thing to talk to young children about especially if it’s something so complex. However I think parents should always be open and explain as best they can because otherwise it can lead to resentment.

This may not be the same thing but it’s similar in that it’s something hard to explain to a child, but my and my twin are IVF and we often got name called because of it, but our parents were super open about it and always answered our questions as appropriately as they could and I think that’s the way to go with explaining anything to a child because you should have known that information as soon as they knew, in my opinion.",405,32,8/25/2020 13:29,igc7l0

It’s still a big struggle, but having her unconditional love and support means the world to me. She said she would move heaven and earth to help me. It was really hard to tell her, so I had to by writing a letter, putting it on her bed and going to a friends house.","Well done,  you should be so proud of yourself 😊",410,23,3/14/2020 13:48,fiim31

mentalhealth,Has anyone else been excluded their entire life,"I’ve always been the odd one out. Every situation I can think of. School, previous jobs, “friends”, relationships, even by family. People go places without me, and it’s been this way for as long as I can remember. When we’ve been placed into groups in school I always tried to talk to everyone but still I noticed they just clicked better with each other. Same thing at my old job, I was just never good enough. People don’t gravitate towards me and never have. No matter how talkative and friendly I am. I’m sure you’ve guessed it by now, yes I’ve always been the therapist friend who never got anything in return. Now the one person who I’m the closest with and love the most went to breakfast with all his friends and I was invited but he left without telling me the plans were still on and excludes me from other plans too. Now I constantly question what’s wrong with me. I always try to talk and include myself and it’ll work for the time being but then I end up being excluded again. I can’t do this anymore.","I want to be optimistic and say ""it's because I haven't reached out to my friends"" and stuff, but I'll be fucking honest, I don't have anyone.  I don't talk to my extended family because in their eyes, I cannot be depressed because my parents love me. Being realistic, I don't have anyone. I don't have anyone who's willing to help me anytime of the day. I don't hang out with anyone.

mentalhealth,Does anyone else feel guilty for their struggles with mental health?,"Ok, I understand that guilt is a huge factor when it comes to people who struggle with mental health. I have been diagnosed with DID and Severe Generalized Anxiety. It has taken me years of medications, various therapists and learned coping mechanisms to be the overall functioning human I am today.  Everyday is still a struggle but, I’m at peace with that and just take things as they come. 

The problem I have is that I sometimes feel like I don’t deserve to have a mental illness. If that makes sense. I had a rough childhood, but when I start to have a break down or anxiety attack, I always think something along the lines of 

“There are definitely people that have had it worse than I have and they are just fine.” 
Or
“Whatever is happening isn’t as bad as what other people go through and I should just suck it up” 

My rational healthy brain tells me everything is relative blah, blah, blah. All the logical things a normal brain would think. Then my unhealthy brain just yells over the logic with intrusive thoughts that I don’t deserve to have these mental issues because my life “isn’t that bad”

I feel like I may not be doing the best job of describing what I’m feeling lol but can anyone relate?

EDIT: Thank you so much for all the comments and support. It always makes things a little easier to know Im not alone in this way of thinking.

In the end, there are still people out there who would like to talk to me and maybe, by a slight chance offer me an opportunity to work.

mentalhealth,Self-care is not participating when you don’t want to.," There  is power in standing up for yourself and sticking to your personal  boundaries regarding how you participate in life as a trauma survivor. I  hate the constant barrage of showing up because of obligation. Fuck  that. I mean, when I think about the fact that people will shame you  over not doing something that you don’t want to do, I get irate. I think  about how many times in our lives that we are put in the position of  showing up due to social constructs, and I want to smash my face into  the wall. **You don’t owe anyone your time or sanity.**

I  implore you to please take care of yourself over the next few weeks  starting today. The number one thing that people healing trauma can do  is to say no or to say nothing at all. You don’t have to go to family  gatherings and events where past abusers are present. You don’t have to  go to work get-togethers because you are in recovery, and Tom can’t have  just one drink. You don’t have to go to the hundreds of things you are  invited to. Why? Because you are a goddamn adult, and you have the  choice here. No one is going to force you into a car, to put the key in  the ignition, drop the gear to D, and hit the road. If I’m wrong about  that, we have much more severe problems on our hands.

Creating agency as a trauma survivor

Look,  here is the deal. We are used to putting our needs secondary as CPTSD  survivors. At some point, our needs got put on the back burner as a  survival mechanism. That is OK. We can acknowledge that. However, as we  move forward, we must follow our gut instinct and listen to what our  soul tells us. If everything in you is screaming, **don’t go,** then don’t go. And don’t tell me that it’s easy said than done because you are in control. Y-O-U.

You  have the power here, and look, I know that is scary, but it’s true. You  can step into your personal boundaries, and your right as a human being  is that you only have to do what you want to do. I trust that the truth  of our healing journey recognizes that we are allowed to have agency in  our lives.

I challenge you to  continue to double-down on your personal boundaries and your right to  say no. Hell, start today. No law states you must suffer through another  family thanksgiving with your narcissistic mother, verbally abusive  step-father, racist grandmother, or anyone in between. Today, if you  need to say no, please say no. Order Pad Thai; it’s better than turkey  anyway.

Until next time my friend…

\-@MichaelUnbroken","But also, sometimes it’s about participating when you don’t want to.

mentalhealth,"If your compassion doesn't include yourself, it's incomplete - be as kind and understanding to yourself as you would be to a friend who is suffering","Compassion is something we find easy when we think of someone we love. But what about someone you find annoying or don’t like? If you think about someone you’ve met who wasn’t very nice to you, or someone that was rude or did something you didn’t agree with, you might ask the question why would you feel compassion for someone who behaves this way. 

The importance of compassion isn’t only to relieve suffering and make the world a better place, it’s to free yourself from your own suffering - your sadness, your anxiety and particularly your anger. When you see the suffering of others in their behaviour it helps to reduce your own resentments.

But where we can really struggle is feeling compassion towards ourselves; when we’re suffering we sometimes punish ourselves more for not being good enough. Compassion begins with yourself - when you let go of the idea of who you think you need to be and accept yourself as you are it’s an act of kindness that allows you to start to let go of suffering.

mentalhealth,We need to change the way we talk about anxiety and depression.,"
I think we need to change the name of anxiety and also depression so that they sound as serious as they are. So many people just completely brush off these serious mental health issues because they are so common. Thinking that ‘feeling depressed’ or a bit ‘anxious’ is the same as a full blown mental illness. Telling someone you have depression or anxiety feels like it has the same impact, as telling someone you have a cold. 
It needs to be talked about in a more serious manner so that people suffering from these sometimes life ruining mental illnesses don’t have to be ashamed. 
Pretty much every person i have spoke to who has or did have clinal depression (including myself) say that they often feel guilty, they have thoughts similar too “other people have it so much worse than me” or “im just over exaggerating.” This is not how things should be. People shouldn’t have to feel bad for being in pain. Think about it this way, you dont see a guy with a broken leg feeling guilty about having broke his leg. No, he goes to the doctors, gets help, lets it heal and will likely receive get well soon letters from family or friends. Why does the same not happen with a broken mind?
If everyone in a community can realise how serious anxiety and depression actually is, then they can empathise with those who suffer, helping MILLIONS of people who’s lives are a constant struggle, to at least feel a little bit more understood, accepted by their peers and less guilty. That to me, would be a massive step in the right direction ❤️


PS. Mental health in general needs to be spoken about a lot more. I just talked about anxiety and depression in this because i feel they are considered less serious than other mental illnesses by many. Thank you for reading!","I completely agree.

mentalhealth,"Being lonely in the 21st Century where we are living in a super-connected world is fricking hard, mentally taxing and it burns me out","To avoid getting into the details, I have to build a thick wall around myself because I have been struggling with multiple mental health issues for pretty much all my life.

But slowly and surely, I have been gathering strategies, techniques and other methods on how to deal with them, even though the amount of effort and time that it took me was way longer than I waited for them to be and I still have a lot stuff to delve into in order to master these strategies.

Over the years, I have been learning how to break that thick wall that I built over the years and slowly creep into the dark unknown and face these demons and even face the real world due to that my experiences has left me with a scared and scarred image of the world.

But for some reason, dealing with loneliness is perhaps one of the most exhausting, nerve-wrecking and humiliating war that I had to fight through.

I am well aware that loneliness is not easy to deal with - it is a mentally tricky thing to face and counter and can lead to so many other traps and other complications and difficulties that you sometimes become stuck in a maze or a in a super-thick and sticky web of different threads with different poisons slowly sucking away what is left of your blood, soul and health.

It is a double-edged sword that you want to get out of this invisible prison but at the same time, the prison is also your only ""home"" and walking out of it is very scary and the fear of being rejected, even if you try to be as friendly as possible, is very tough to overcome.

&#x200B;

The person few years, I had to really pull myself from my bootstraps to overcome the traps of loneliness - the fear of being rejected, the neediness of attention and the appropriate social skills for different situations.

Yet for some reason, as much as the world of today *should* be able to allow me to use the resources that we use today like social media to my advantage to reach out but in reality, it is often the opposite!!

&#x200B;

I know that social media is a big joke and a trap of itself where behind every smile and photo of the last party, dinner or get away that you want to hides a dark thing that you do not want to share to the rest of the world.

Yet at the same time, seeing the sheer amount of photos and posts where I see smiles and even laughs with other people, friends or even random strangers, it makes me feel angry and pathetic with myself, desperate to do something about it.

I reached out plenty of times with other people but more often than not, communication in the 21st Century makes us more alien than connecting to one another.

It is super easy to ghost someone nowadays or leave a seen without even giving a clear reason why or giving the cold shoulder because the person you are talking to is simply a stranger or you do not like for no reason whatsoever. I constantly feel that I do not know where I am with another person. It is humiliating and nerve-wracking and it burns me out. It makes me feel pitiful, petty, little. It makes me feel less of a human being and like I am being passively-aggressively bullied.

&#x200B;

Yet it is also pretty hilarious that the technology of today is supposed to make us more connected yet it makes it too easy to push people away. 

Why is it common to leave only seen almost after every message? Why not just speak from the heart? Or just say a word? Anything

I feel humiliated and angry and constantly going through a thick and mighty storm every day to keep myself sane throughout this process and it feels like I am going around in circles or walking inside a maze where I have no idea where I am going.

I know that loneliness is also in my head (even though my mind and body have real reactions to the feeling) but this feeling is incredibly overwhelming and when I try to reach out, nobody is available or I have to be very careful of what to say to others as though I am walking on eggshells because of random excuses like being busy or unavailable and/or whatever excuse they can think of to avoid contact","Hey! I'm 30F, live in Australia. No (meaningful) friends. I don't have any social media (besides this). I live alone, never had a boyfriend. I am an introvert and have borderline personality disorder along with a host of other things: depression, anxiety, a little OCD, panic disorder. 

I would go so far as saying I've been lonely my whole life, and at 30 years of age I'm exhausted. I don't have any friends to go out and meet people, I don't have any friends to make connections to others, i study uni online so that's isolating as well (yes that was my choice but whatever). The depression and introvertedness keep me at home, but staying at home also fuels the depression. But if I go out, it's always on my own so like there's no joy there anyway. It's an awful cycle that keeps feeding off of itself.

I've tried online dating but I struggle to keep the other person interested. I don't have any outlandish hobbies so on paper I look boring but in person I feel I'm actually ok but they won't be able to see that unless I meet them but I struggle to get to that stage.

Loneliness is actuallly said to have an effect on the heart and that people can literally die of loneliness. I firmly believe that. I'd like to maintain hope that I will meet someone but (not having a pity party) I just feel that judging by the trajectory of my life, it's not going to change. And I have to make adjustments for that outlook. Most of the life decisions I make centre around me being single for the rest of my life. 🤷‍♀️

I wrote in my journal that I didn’t think I would reach 17 and it was almost like a goodbye letter. Today I reached 17 years of age and I’ve never felt so excited about reaching an age.

mentalhealth,The medical system in the United States is awful.,"I have been diagnosed with seven different things throughout my life.
Borderline personality disorder, anxiety, depression, insomnia, EDNOS, psychosis, and most recently ADHD.
I had most of these conditions for all of my life, but due to my parents never believing i was ill, and the shitty medical system in America, i haven't gotten the proper treatment.
My ADHD is my biggest struggle right now. It's only gotten worse and worse as i've gotten older, and now, the hyperactivity and inattention is destroying my life and makes me feel like i'm crawling out of my skin daily. 
I was finally able to start looking into therapy and medication options for my ADHD all the way back in March. It's August, and i still have not been put on medication. I did start therapy recently, and it can be helpful, but seems like she doesn't give a fuck about me most of the time. 
My treatment has been consistently put off and scheduled to a later date. Obviously, due to my mental problems i'm very impatient, so this has made it ten times worse.
It's like the fucking medical system is mocking me.
""Oh you have a severe case of ADHD, as well as other unmanaged mental illnesses? Let's make you wait over half a year to get treatment, that'll be great for you."" 
The only time therapists, psychiatrists, and doctors seem to care about you is if you are dying or about to kill yourself. Otherwise, nobody gives a ahit about you, and i absolutely hate that about the medical system.",It’s so hard to get mental health treatment here. You got to be rich and privileged to be able to get help easily. Otherwise you have to spend years struggling and fighting just to get treatment.

So to be honest this pandemic and being stuck in the house all the time has been really getting to my mental health lately and I haven’t been feeling the greatest. I live in the New England area and one thing I enjoy doing to get my mind straight again when I’m not feeling like myself is hiking. For several weeks I’ve been asking my group friends if they would be down to go on a hike, to which they would say yes and then bail on the day or just straight up say no. Which is fine, I get it, things happen and people make other plans. However, one weekend I decided not to ask because I’d already asked the last few weeks prior and then I checked Snapchat to find that a few friends I asked posted pictures of a hike that they did together on their story. I’m sure you can imagine how shitty this felt having asked to do a hike several times, being bailed on or told no, and then finding out my “friends” decided to do a hike without me. Has anyone else been in a situation like this before?","I had something similar happen to me about 6 months ago. I felt so awful, but I've always had a hard time making friends so I also wasn't surprised. I worked at Starbucks with a bunch of girls my age and I suggested the idea of us all going to a pumpkin farm. They said the idea sounded fun. A few days later, they were excited talking about plans for the weekend to go to a pumpkin farm together and never invited me. It was very confusing...one girl in the group painted me a small lemon painting like a week later and paintings for others at work too so I didn't feel left out then...but it still left a bad taste in my mouth so I didn't try to be her friend or hangout with anyone when I stopped working at Starbucks. Some people are just super inconsiderate tbh. I'm too hurt by these past situations to just open up to being friends with anyone now.

mentalhealth,my brain tries to convince me that everyone secretly hates me,"I was diagnosed with social anxiety 4 years ago.
Lately I've been noticing that after social interactions I can't stop thinking about the ways I ""messed up"". And even though I'm able to convince myself logically that it wasn't that bad and that people don't hate me for it, I keep thinking that they just pretend to like me and secretly think I'm a terrible person.

I can't stop beating myself up over minor mistakes and I try to distract myself from these thoughts, but they always come back and then they won't leave me alone. I've talked to others and asked for their assessment of the situation that I currently can't stop thinking about and they reassure me that it's not that bad which helps for a while but then I go back to thinking that I made a horrible mistake and people are lying to me when they say it's okay.

This happens with things that happened years ago or when I was a child, too. It's keeping me up at night, it makes me feel physically sick, it makes it hard to eat and makes me angry because I'm trying to get better, I'm trying to put myself out there and overcome my fears but as soon as I'm alone with my thoughts it backfires.

He is one of the reasons I’m still alive. 

I feel so empty and have cried so hard my head feels like it’s going to pop. I almost broke my 3-4 months of no cutting streak. 

I don’t have family anymore. I didn’t have a human family to show to my boyfriend so I showed him my dogs, they are all I have. My two dogs were the only family I could give him and all became one big family.

It hurts to just look at him, to think that he won’t know what’s going on and look at me while I have to watch him fall asleep. 

I have no one to tell other than my boyfriend that one of my family members is going to be put down today. 

So I’m telling anyone whose reading this that my best friend is being put to sleep. I’ve never felt with death and it’s not going so well. I want to keep him here but I can’t, no one wins in that situation. Constant suffering for us both: even if no one reads this, I love him so much. I wish you all got to have fun with him and love him the way I have.

A part of my family is going to be gone in a couple of hours. We’re going to miss him so much.","You have my sympathies. It's hard to lose a loved one. But please consider this, you clearly care very much about your dog, and I'm certain you gave him a wonderful life. Your life and his are both fuller for having known each other, and nothing can change that. You might not see him again, but you'll always carry a piece of him with you in your heart, and in this way you'll always keep at least the memory of him alive.

All that lives is born, one way or another, and we regard this as both natural and for lack of a better term, ""healthy"". Likewise, why should we consider dying to be any different? It's a natural part of life. In fact, birth implies the inevitability of death, and that's okay. It's fine to let yourself grieve and be sad at the loss of a loved one's continued physical presence in our lives, but I think it's important to recognize that is what we grieve, and not the act of dying itself.",378,35,9/26/2020 18:21,j0aztn

I try to fight this feeling by playing memory games, drinking a lot of coffee and reading lots of non-fiction books but nothing helps. I should also point out that I don't have any diagnosed mental or cognitive illnesses, In a recent IQ test I scored 109 (Even though the paper specified that the results might be a bit inaccurate since my scores to each section of the test were very imbalanced meaning that I could be a genius when it comes to logic but a dumbass when it comes to memory. Either way, they didn't specify nor did they tell me if the actual results are likely higher or lower)

mentalhealth,Ignoring Instagram for the sake of your Depression,"Hey guys and girls,

in the last time I'm again at a very low point of my life and deep depression. I noticed that my feelings get worse when I'm scrolling through instagram seeing the posts and ""lives"" of other people and friends. I know it's not always the whole reality they show there, it's only the best part they post often with big theatre to have a worthy post. That's life today. Still I feel so bad seeing other people being with other people together having fun which remembers me that I should do the same but I'm not able to have much joy due to my depression and social anxiety. Then I feel guilty and worthless.

Who else here has the same experiences? Did anyone of you quit or at least ignore instagram for a time and saw definite positive improvements in their mental health? I think I won't delete Instagram as it's something a bit important like WhatsApp. Well ok it's not even near as important as WhatsApp but I don't know I probably would miss some things as I already deleted snapchat years ago and people tell me oh you missed this and that I sent you. But that's no problem for me, WhatsApp & Instagram is enough of the always online always having to present the perfect life bullshit.

I would love to read about your experiences and suggestions! Much love to everyone with depression, it's only the brain telling us false things and emotions. It's not reality.

Oh, that didn’t work, lets take a another spin of the wheel, OK how about this one? Meanwhile meet with a therapist and talk about stuff. And of course lots of advice from friends, family, and society at large... exercise, eat this diet, meditate, practice gratitude! I’ve tried so many different things my head is spinning.

The mental health community has put the carriage before the horses. With the amount of advertisement and pro-mental health talk, you'd believe there was a huge proverbial army ready to provide ""help"". The reality is the system and resources are scarce, expensive, slow, lackluster, disparate, and dismissive.

At a time when a person is struggling, desperate, suicidal, barely able to function at a base level, and falling apart; on top of all that they're expected to navigate the garbage system of resources while being told ""your life is your own responsibility"".

This isn't meant to be a dart against any individual mental health professionals. There are some great people out there working hard to do what they can to help. 

But the reality is, our understanding of the mental health issues and the resources needed to combat those issues just aren't at a robust enough level yet, and it's actually damaging to get people's hopes up about finally fixing their issues and then facing the realities of the system.

That being said, I do hope you keep at it and continue searching for solutions, and I wish you all the best",375,33,7/11/2020 22:51,hpjima

mentalhealth,"After more than 2 years working on a relationship with a person suffering with mental illness, I can say I've reached a place where we both feel deeply happy and in love"," I have a 2 year long relationship with someone diagnosed with Schizoaffective disorder. Things have been very hard in the past, but right now, I feel really happy on my relationship and I do envision a long term future with this person. I don't exactly know why I am writing this, but since I feel like sharing a little of my story with the world, I thought it might be useful to someone to read my statement about my experience and journey to where I am now.

Things were really hard in the beginning. My partner was very unstable and deeply depressed, simple things like sleeping or eating were herculean tasks to him that demanded a lot. Huge anxiety was easily triggered, that led to paranoid and intrusive thoughts, specially at night. Sometimes it lasted a couple of days, sometimes it lasted weeks, or a month. I really felt like on the more ""happy"" and stable days I had to take the best advantage out of it so that he felt like ""coming back"" from the pit hole was worth it. I felt like every time we cycled back into a depressive episode he was further and further away from me. I knew I couldn't really do much more than support him and maintain the bare minimum communication he allowed me to have with him but I just kept insisting and insisting because I thought that if I stopped doing so he would just detach completely from everything and everyone.

It was rough. Sometimes the emotional distance between us was so big that I thought I was in love with a man that would never love me. I felt neglected emotionally a lot of the times because I was supporting everything I could but I couldn't really have that back because my partner was living in a ""survival"" mode. When he became more willing to share, our communication also improved, he shared more with me and I learned how to help him better and also how to help myself to not take things too personally sometimes. Also, therapy and medical treatment were of main importance for his progress of course. There's no partner that can cure an illness, it can make it less difficult, for sure, but only the right treatment can really make it better. Fast forward to nowadays my partner works a full time job with quite some responsibility, he has plans for the future with me, he's stable, for the most part, he keeps his medical and therapy appointments on check, and he's happy. I wouldn't be with anyone else but him. I'm more confident than I have ever been, for the first time I feel someone truly sees me. and values me. We're both on our early 20s and starting our careers, I hope we can move in together in the near future, of course there are still bad times, but I do think we are more prepared now to manage the hard times.

I love him deeply, I'm so so proud of him for overcoming so much and that he's no longer suicidal. I am beyond happy he hang on long enough to embrace the person he's becoming and let himself love and be loved too. There's no better feeling in the world than just laying on his chest listening to his heart beating at night before falling asleep, I now it sounds very cheesy, but it's really the truth for me, it does feel like heaven.

If you're on a relationship going with a hard time understanding and dealing with your partner's mental health, I don't mean with this that you should stay and that you should endure all of it because I know how brutal and lonely it can be. Mental illness is devastating for the ones suffering with it, but also to others close to them. On a relationship, it can indeed became unhealthy for both parts to stay together, so, by no means I believe that the answer is always to stay. I only want to say that sometimes, it takes time and work, but things do get better, a lot better.","I'm proud of you for being a beautiful soul and being so loving.  Without people like you, there would be a ton of miserable, lonely people in this world.  I'm so glad that you two are doing well, and it only gets better from here. <3",374,14,10/20/2020 2:10,jegd7z

mentalhealth,One year ago I asked this subreddit “How do I find joy in life?”,"One year ago I came to this subreddit asking for assistance on how to find the joy in life again. I had given up, didn’t even think I’d make it through the rest of the year. 2020 may have been complete hell for a lot of people but for me, it changed my life. I got sick of feeling awful every day, I got sick of not being happy, sick of not wanting to wake up every day and sick of feeling lower than bedrock. I don’t know how I did it, maybe mental fortitude, I’m not completely sure. But one day I turned that “switch” in my mind off and haven’t looked back since. Now I haven’t done a full 180, more like a 145 but honestly I have never been happier. Yes, happy. For the first time in over 7 years I can finally say I am happy. My rescue dog Loki has been a huge help for that. Now I know my journey is far from over but right now I am maneuvering all the mental obstacles that get in my way, and I’m not done yet. I am going to make 2021 my bitch and make that 145 a full 180. Yeah only one person has told me they are proud of my progress and yeah he wasn’t even family, hadn’t even talked to the kid in over two years but that was one of the first things he said to me after we caught up. But I’m proud of myself. Now I want those of you struggling right now to see this and know you can make it through whatever it is you are going through right now. You are going to be and always will be your strongest ally, but I believe in you all. I believe in the strength you all have because you are enough, you do mean something to each of those people you don’t think you do. Your life matters more than you could ever imagine. Last thing, I am proud of each of you reading this for making it this far, because you had the strength to fight every single damn day and you are all inspirations to me and all those around you.

mentalhealth,My mother told me to find somewhere else to kill myself.,"Last night, during an hour-long completely one-sided tirade, my mother screamed that when I kill myself, not to do it in the house, because she didn't want to deal with the mess.

I was already building the resolve to commit suicide throughout her rant. I got hit with the typical ""you're not depressed, you're lazy"", and all the related tropes about how my situation is all my fault and anything she's doing is just in response to me ""hurting"" her by existing.

I've posted about my situation here before, and to be honest I'm extremely surprised I made it this long. But when my own mother's response to knowing I am suicidal is to tell me not to get the carpets dirty, I'm feeling like it's time to cash out.  


Edit: Thanks, everyone, for all the support. If you sent a DM, I've read and am thankful for your support there as well; I'm just having weird anxiety about one-on-one conversation, which seems backwards because I'm fine with public venting, but that's anxiety for you.

mentalhealth,Driving around for hours listening to Nine Inch Nails and getting pulled over by the military police has been an oddly enlightening experience.,"I'd even go so far as to say spiritual, and I do *not* consider myself spiritual or religious (anymore).

I was feeling like shit today, borderline suicidal, and since I'm living with my parents for the time being, I had to get out of the house to feel through my emotions in private. And it was just... the most compelling feeling of peace I've experienced in a long time. Something about the music throbbing while I drove through a really heavy fog, only car on the road, with the streetlights glowing pretty colors through the mist, just got my thoughts flowing freely again.

I won't jump the gun and say I'm cured, but I did just resist some self destructive habits once I got home, and I'm now doing the coursework that I've been putting off at risk of failing out of school because I *just. didn't. have the energy for it*... So even if I wake up next week and I'm worse off and I feel silly for being optimistic, at least I got a precious window of peace and lucidity that helped me to at least pass the semester.

Oh, and getting pulled over! So, I was so absorbed with my thoughts, I was doing the drive on autopilot thing - see and react to things like red lights and sudden movements, but not really think about where I'm going. I was just navigating by instinct and I ended up going too far on a road and heading for the military base just outside town. Turns out, military cops don't really like it when you suddenly show up to their gates in the middle of the night with a car full of mysterious boxes (haven't fully unpacked yet), then suddenly freak out, turn around, drive on the wrong side of the road for a minute, then correct yourself and try to leave thinking nobody saw you being silly and stupid.

Anyway, the guy that immediately pulled me over was... just a really, really genuine human. He asked me how my night was going and I just explained the whole thing, the need to get out and clear my head, the reason I was too distracted to see the big ass signs about it being a military base (that's also due to the fog, it was incredibly thick, in my defense). Sounded like an absolute nervous wreck. And he listened. And he was really empathetic, just letting me off with a warning.

The funny thing is, I spent a while beating myself up, thinking ""man, this guy must think I'm some huge kind of stupid weak kid. He's a responsible ass adult, working a job in public safety, and here he is, having to chase down a stupid kid with a panic issue. All because *I* can't properly process my feelings.""

But I considered it for a bit, and I realized that this random cop, who doesn't owe me anything, who's shift I rudely interrupted, saw me in one of my worst states and still had it in him to treat me kindly and *listen* to me. Actually *listen* to what I was going through. And I realized that I haven't been doing that for myself.

Guys, see, I need to treat myself with the same empathy and sincerity that this cop treated me with. I need to listen to myself, and forgive myself \~\~even\~\~ *especially* when I'm in my worst states. Because the only way to leave those states is with love and support, and 90% of the time, when I'm not lucky enough to have this cop around, I need to provide that love and support for myself.  I think, for the first time in a long time, I can cut the cynicism for one little moment and tell myself *it's gonna be okay...* and actually mean it.",[deleted],355,8,5/12/2020 11:09,gi96dv
mentalhealth,"""Your child, your rules"" is single-handedly the most stupid saying I have ever heard","Now, I am speaking from experience when I say that this statement does wayyyyyy more harm than it ever did good. My mother is an abusive POS, father was even worse before he was divorced. Routinely, I would go to over to videos on subreddits and just watch some posts there. I recently saw a post about parenting, and people in the comments all had the same general consensus that ""your child, your rules""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Problem is, no one really gets all the possible ways that this could be applied. Sure, it is usually used for logical stuff like what religion the child is associated with or maybe whether the child is a vegetarian or a meat-eater. But have you thought this saying through? You're saying that it is this person's child, and that they should be able to make the rules. You are putting this person on one of the most dangerous power trips ever. Now, what would you do if you found out this person over/underfeeds their child? What if they feed the child too much junk, or strictly healthy foods without letting them have any junk food? What would you do if, whenever the child speaks up, they shut them down and go on a tangent before mentioning ""I'm your parent!""? Now do you see where I'm coming from? Look, that was pretty much my story, so I hope you really listen to what I'm saying. I'm 15 years old and I could tell you that shit is damaging. I don't need anyone going through something similar because people keep using this idiotic statement.   


  
And yes, I know this sounds like a giant hyperbole, but it really isn't. Think about it, if you're living with the mentality that ""this is my child, I set the rules for them and no one else"" you are most likely going to turn out as an abusive/narcissistic parent. It's a terrible lesson to be spreading on these subreddits, and are most of the time not even warranted. Being a parent means nothing more than you contributed to the birth and growth of this child, and you are not at all entitled to jack shit if you betray that initial trust. Respect is a two way street, regardless of who you are.","I think its important to take comments like that in context. 

In your context you're an abused child/teen, so of course telling your parents ""Your child, your rules"" is a terrible idea.

If it's a parent who got stopped in the street and shouted at for feeding their child a cookie, then ""Your child, your rules"" is way more relevant and makes sense. 

I agree with you that it is overused and over-simplified because people like short and simple phrases even if the nuance behind them is more complex. It's really just to remind parents that it's ok to ignore unsolicited and unhelpful advice from judgy people in the street because every family  situation is different and has different rules. (Of course, those rules should be non-abusive, but most people don't feel the need to *say* that because they think it's obvious.) In a parenting advice context, it's not bad advice unless the parents are already abusive. 

In an abusive household context of course its terrible advice.",357,17,12/9/2020 23:27,ka3csj

mentalhealth,I did something today that I haven't done since 2019,"I folded my laundry.

Just about one year ago, my OCD caused me to suffer (another) complete mental and emotional breakdown/collapse, culminating in an unsuccessful suicide attempt. Being in such an unstable state is one thing, but then being quarantined and unemployed made things...dark. Horrific, really. I spent every waking and sleeping moment in bed, trying to escape the confines of my own mind. I would go a week without showering, wearing the same sweats and t-shirt every day. I very nearly attempted suicide again.

Before the day I ""broke"", I had emptied my dresser and closet, and did a giant wash of almost every item of everyday wear I owned, clothes for all seasons. And for the next year, they lay in assorted baskets strewn across the laundry room, untouched and unexplored. I've started coming around to stability and normality over the past month, and today decided to finally take a step out of the darkness, and fold my god damn laundry.

And it feels amazing.

I don't mean to sound braggy or anything...I guess I just wanna say that things can better and the small victories can be really powerful and uplifting. The dark times seem eternal--but with hard work, therapy, meds, faith, support, family and friends--whatEVER aids your mental health journey--things CAN get better. Even in times such as these.

I don’t mean to do this and feel like an awful friend whenever I start drifting away from people, but I get so scared whenever I feel like I tell people too much in case they use that information negatively. It’s all in my mind but it’s either open up a little as I get closer which is normal, or continue to treat the person like a stranger. 

I feel like a useless person because I’m afraid of losing friendships. I almost never text first, I hide from social interaction and now with being home all the time, I’m afraid that when I can go out again I’ll be worse","Hello! I would suggest opposite action. It’s a classic DBT technique, but it can take a lot to master. Start trying to challenge your fears. When you want to isolate, get closer. When you want to hide yourself, open up. It will really help you be able to keep friendships. If you are feeling brave enough (which it is totally fine if you aren’t), you can tell some of these friends your situation, and they can help you feel more comfortable. I know it probably sounds hard, but it is possible. If you want, you can message me privately to tell me more about why you separate yourself.

Trust me, doing little opposite actions can help you get more confident in yourself, and be more comfortable with discomfort, if that makes sense.

I really do hope you find something that helps for you!",350,14,11/22/2020 2:59,jyoaa6
mentalhealth,My Parents Punished me for Having PTSD," I had been sexually abused by my grandfather for 3-4 years, literally all of my early childhood - I do not have a single memory before him abusing me. My parents found out after constantly punishing me for masturbating (in my room), wetting the bed, having outbursts, etc. There was legal action taken, I was in counseling for the bare minimum time. 

 I had horrible nightmares, night terrors, I sleptwalked. My parents literally punished me for getting out of bed and waking my mom (who was a stay at home mom with all of her kids being in school for 8 hours out of the day) up because I had nightmares that made me feel terrified, paralyzed, and unable to go back to sleep. 

 On one specific occasion, I remember being in the 3rd or 4th grade (only 1-2 years after the abuse had ended) and waking my mom up because I had a nightmare about dolls trying to kill me. My parents were so mad that my dad made me sleep with the light on in an attempt to make it where I couldn't sleep, when I did fall asleep that night he came in and intentionally woke me up telling me I didn't deserve to be asleep, I was going to learn a lesson about waking my mom up, and that he hoped I didn't sleep all night (I had school the next morning). On top of all of that, they made me stay home from a party that everyone else got to go to (my mom stayed home with me). When they got back my sister had brought me candy, he said I wasn't allowed to have it. He also made a point of saying how everyone asked where I was and he told EVERYONE why I couldn't be there, and he made me feel guilty for my mom not being able to go and having to stay home. 

  I confronted my mom about it today (I'm 24) and she just immediately started saying the typical, ""Oh yeah we get it, we're terrible parents, your childhood was terrible."" She then kept saying I never told them I was having nightmares even though I remember ALWAYS telling them about my nightmares and the only time I didn't get punished was the night I had a nightmare about someone shooting my family because that was deemed realistic enough to be afraid. I told her all I wanted her to do was apologize and she full out said she will never apologize and to leave her alone.

  I got frustrated and sarcastically asked if they were never told I would have PTSD after being abused my entire childhood, she said no. So I asked if they seriously didn't have enough common sense to think maybe their child was traumatized and she said no. 

  My parents were so focused on making me ""normal"" that they traumatized me worse than that abuse ever did and they won't even acknowledge that they did anything wrong.","I feel you. Same shit happened to me. Even worse, my own mother not only shamed me for having PTSD she ignored professional referrals and hired a bunch of quack shrinks to further fuck with my mind. At least you know you have an issue. I was made to drink the kool-aide and went 35 years pretending everything was okay. Smh

The trauma is real. So is the negligence and the emotional abuse perpetrated by your parents. I have gone no contact for these same reasons. Every so often my mother will try to contact me and attempt to lure me back to crazytown. I tell her we cannot have a relationship because she refuses to be responsible for anything. It's impossuble to trust somebody who cannot tell the truth, and show accountability, and there can be no relationship without a basic foundation of trust.

You got to understand, these people in your familybare even more fucked up than you or me. They live in a permanent state of denial and will concoct lies upon lies anytime their manufactured little reality is threatened. It's an illness, don't take it too personal. It's not about you or your value as a person. Even if you weren't abused, they would still find reasons to treat you like shit and make you miserable. That's their aim. It gives them their feelings of superiority they crave. You're never going to change that.

I stongly suggest you walk away. Seek a trauma informed therapist if you haven't already. Do not fall for guilt trips or other mind games. Use the same narrative with them: You cannot be honest with me. You dismiss my feelings and lie about your involvement in my abuse. You made a choice every single day to neglect me and you still cannot allow yourself to extend an ounce of compassion. 

The narrative is for you, not them. It's an anti-gaslighting device that helps you remeber why you are forced to do what you're doing to keep away. Plus, it easily sums up the problem so they can understand why they have lost your trust. Of course, your mother will die before she admits that any of this is true. But deep down in her heart she knows all of it is true. That's the reason for the indignation and outrage. It's camoflage for what they cannot ever admit to themselves: they truly are horrible people.",347,31,11/6/2020 15:03,jp6m2x

mentalhealth,"My girlfriend struggles with anxiety and depression, and I want to know how to give support best I can.","My girlfriend struggles with anxiety a lot, as well as depression. Her depression has become self harm and suicidal thoughts. I've tried to give care the best I can, I've had a few sleepless nights stopping her from committing to her thoughts and.... Fuck man. I've never really struggled with such thoughts or emotions. I deal with stress with anger, and I vent that through other less damaging means, usually in a gym or something, so I'm unsure on what exactly I should be saying. I feel she hides it from me sometimes, either cause she's ashamed or scared of hurting me. She has really bad times and right now we're going through one of them, where she is saying she feels alone and powerless, as well as everything going too fast and she can't keep up with the world. I love this woman with all my heart, and I hate to see her hurting. Can anyone offer any advice or anything that may help?","Don’t try changing her too much. My last relationship was destroyed by mental health issues between us. You cannot force her to love herself and to want to live, she has to find it on her own. Trying to push that can be damaging, leaving you worse than where you started. Trust me, it isn’t pretty. Trying to change someone can be construed as not loving them as they are, which leads to them hating themselves for their issues.

Be supportive. Be her shoulder to lean on. If she has issues, let her explain them and do your best to understand. People with mental disorders have certain behaviors that can seem odd or bizarre but are just a way of coping or are a symptom of the illness. For instance, I sometimes get very moody because of my medication and I can’t stay up very late because I get way more suicidal late at night. That’s a tame example, but it still works.

Make her feel accepted for who she is, not who you want her to be. Knowing that someone loves you, mental Illness and all, and knowing that they won’t walk out because of your issues means the world.

I will never not struggle with my mental health, so what these people are actually saying is that I should never date anyone ever. They'll usually say stuff like ""you're only gonna hurt or burden the other person"". Like no I am open about my mental health from the start, and I try my absolute best to not let it affect my relationships. 

This is just overall a really harmful thing to say to anyone struggling.","For multiple reasons. It also depends on the severity of your mental health issues. For example, if someone has unregulated bipolar, that's very difficult to deal with. When two people with mental health issues are in a relationship, that also causes problems. 

Relationships are difficult, period - because, as humans, we're innately flawed. Under the best of circumstances, we can try to communicate effectively...but throw in daily stressors, poor sleep, mental health issues etc. and it becomes more difficult. 

I don't think it's fair to say you're going to hurt or burden another person purely because you have mental health issues - and, frankly, I find it offensive that someone would suggest that. Mental health problems are often a lifelong struggle - and to suggest that anyone dealing with them should somehow ""spare"" others and avoid relationships is complete nonsense. 

My personal advice, as someone who struggles with crippling social anxiety, depression etc., is to continue being open and upfront about your mental health issues - and to make a concerted effort to prioritize good communication in all your interpersonal relationships.

That - and don't listen to people who apparently think you should just sequester yourself in some fortress of solitude and live in isolation for the rest of your life. Seriously, what absolute hogwash. I'm sorry but that's just ignorant.",350,74,2/12/2020 2:08,f2jkuf

I sometimes look like a maniac walking down the street and I'm sure my flatmates are a bit weirded out by it.

It has been happening for a few years, but recently they just keep coming and they almost feel like an electric shock. This is causing me a lot of stress and while I never seriously considered suicide, after I get a few of these episodes I start fantasising about what would happen if I just ended it. I know it's not a good sign.

Is this common, and is there anything I can do about it? I don't think I have Tourette's syndrome as  I can sort of control my reactions (not the thoughts) when I'm surrounded with people I know.","Yeah,  i had a lot of these intrusive thoughts as a result of my anxiety and depression. It's a self-feeding downward spiral. In therapy I learned about how to redirect my attention. Nobody can control the thoughts that just pop into our heads. We can control how much attention we give those thoughts. 

Sure, we all make mistakes. Ideally we think about how we could have done it differently and try to do better. But reliving every painful embarrassment over and over in our minds doesn't achieve anything. If you find yourself mired in these patterns you should consider therapy. If you're having increasing symptoms of anxiety and depression that effect your motivation and self-worth and stir hopelessness, then medication may be appropriate.",346,46,4/24/2020 18:13,g7dfru
mentalhealth,Haven't showered in weeks,"I would never admit this irl but I can't remember the last time I showered. It was either 2 or 3 weeks ago. I know it's gross. Usually when I'm not doing great I am motivated to have at least 1 shower a week because of church but there's no church atm. I've been intending to shower but I just haven't gotten round to it. I usually sleep a lot, eat breakfast, go back to lie in my bed and watch videos, occasionally sit up in bed and go on my laptop, eat lunch, eat dinner, sleep, repeat.

Tomorrow I'm actually going to shower and wash my super greasy hair because I'm leaving the house for the first time in over a month. Me and my dad are going cycling for our hour of daily exercise. I might even shave which would make me feel more comfortable wearing summery clothes.

Inevitable edit: Thanks everyone for commenting. Sadly I don't think I can reply to everyone but I have read and appreciate all the responses and I'm glad if my post has helped anyone else struggling. I have now had a shower (woo woo!) and a half-assed shave so yippee for patchy legs lol. Again thank you everyone, I love how supportive and non-judgemental this community is.","I showered for the first time in weeks today. You're not alone.

mentalhealth,A Letter To Those Wanting To Understand Their Loved Ones With Mental Illness," 

A Letter To Those Wanting To Understand Their Loved Ones With Mental Illness,

If you are reading this as one of **many** who doesn’t understand what it’s like to deal with mental illness, I am very happy you don’t experience firsthand what I and so many others have to experience on a daily basis because...

**I would not wish this pain on my worst enemy.**

**I am so happy** you don’t have to experience feeling that no one in your life truly loves or cares about you, despite them reassuring you that they do on almost a daily basis.

**I am so happy** you haven’t had to answer any of the further questions that follow “do you feel anxious or depressed?” when visiting the doctor’s office.

**I am so happy** you have never thought the world is better without you in it.

If you have never had to leave a party because of a sudden wave of anxiety or sadness, *I really hope it stays that way.*

If you are able to get out of bed without feeling nauseous with anxiety or the weight of depression, *appreciate it* every single day**.**

**Don’t ever take it for granted.**

Don’t let a day go by without appreciating how *beautiful* life is and can be. Because many of us, myself included, aren’t always able to see that beauty, no matter how hard we try.

While mental illness is something that is so wrongfully romanticized in the movies, **it is very ugly in real life.** Mental illness is not **“quirky”** or **“poetic”** like society makes it seem on social media.

Being mentally ill isn’t *aesthetic worthy,* mascara filled tears with sad music in the background; mental illness is barely being able to keep up basic personal hygiene because it feels almost physically **impossible** to get out of bed. 

**Mental illness makes the world seem pointless.** 

So when a loved one approaches you seeking comfort or a listening ear, please don’t automatically assume it is an annoying cry for attention. Because I promise you, that assumption is our **worst fear.**

**The last thing we wish for is to be a burden on the ones we love.**

Isn’t it ironic that even when we are struggling, our first thought is to not make our loved ones uncomfortable?

And when we cancel plans or fail to stay around the entirety of a social outing, don’t take it personally.Trust me, we already beat ourselves up for it enough already because we finally put ourselves first for once, even though that is what we should’ve been doing all along. 

When we isolate ourselves from you and push you away, don’t think it is us being rude. We are just trying to do what we can to feel like we aren’t dragging you down with us.

Please do not blame us for the cards we got dealt, we deal with them the best we are able to, even if it means pushing loved ones away to avoid getting hurt. 

Most of all, see mental illness as you would any broken bone or any physical sickness.**It hurts just as bad and is equally out of our control.**So, while we don’t wish you would first handedly understand, we want you to **be patient** and understand the best you are able to.

**We are fighting an invisible illness that we aren’t always sure we can beat.**

However, even with this ongoing battle to stay afloat in our own minds filled with endless thoughts, **not every single day is a bad one.** 

In fact, we go through periods of time where everything feels alright again for a while. So when those good days finally come around, we appreciate it and never take it for granted. 

Because to those who struggle with mental illness, it is a privilege to feel the true happiness that **everyone** deserves to feel every day.

Sincerely,

The mentally ill",Im ill myself and you know that was just the tip of the iceberg. Im astonished how well you put it tho! Hopefully this reaches those intended thx for speaking where i can not.,351,17,11/19/2020 8:42,jwz8qk
mentalhealth,We are asking Congress to take action on the mental health crisis in America.,"Hey guys,

We are a group of high school students who are committed to solving the mental health issues of today through awareness and policy. The mental health crisis is one of the most prevalent issues facing the American population today, not only the youth. 

We are also compiling a list of candidate endorsements who are pledging to focus on mental health reform once they are inaugurated.

In fact, 1 in 5 American adults experience some form of mental illness each year (National Alliance on Mental Illness), while only 41% receive proper treatment (Mental Health First Aid). This is unacceptable, and we demand action now.

We’ve witnessed these problems in our own schools and neighborhoods, and we believe it is time for us as a country to step up and pass bold solutions to protect everyday people. 

We are also asking you to sign and share our petition (https://www.change.org/p/u-s-congress-pass-comprehensive-mental-health-legislation-now ) to ask Congress and the President to commit to comprehensive mental health reform to ensure that everyone has access to quality mental health care.

Thank you.

Edit: Thanks for the overwhelming support, we would never have dreamt of getting almost 350 upvotes in only one day. We have just started a GoFundMe in order to raise money to increase the awareness of this crisis on more platforms such as 
Instagram, Twitter, and Google. The link can be found at (https://www.gofundme.com/f/ask-congress-to-priortize-mental-health?utm_source=customer&utm_medium=copy_link-tip&utm_campaign=p_cp+share-sheet). Have a great day!",#GOD BLESS YOU.,348,17,1/17/2020 22:43,eq7t8i
mentalhealth,I just found out why I’ve been depressed,"So I have a therapist and We’ve been talking about how I’ve been pretty depressed lately, she advised that my mother go take me to get a blood test for vitamin D done. I got the results back a couple days  ago and found out I’m at a fourteen for vitamin D, for reference the health levels are around 40-60. So now I have some medication I’m going to get. Hopefully things will start turning up.",That’s great that you found some answers!! Lack of Vitamin D definitely makes my depression worse. Seasonal depression is very real during winter. Whenever there is a sunny day my mood and energy levels noticeably improve. So take the drops and get some sun when you can!,343,35,3/13/2020 12:50,fhz5fa

mentalhealth,Does anyone else get the feeling that no one cares what you have to say despite wanting to let it out?,"I have been dealing with this one issue that occurred last summer and no matter how hard I try to talk to someone about it, I feel like they don’t care. I don’t feel comfortable posting it online as I feel like it’s just a waste of time and no one will read it. Ive never been to a therapist so maybe that will help, but I also don’t want to pay for someone to tell me to just ignore it. I’ve had many issues growing up and it seems like they just grow stronger, no matter how hard I try making use of myself.",Maybe you feel they don't care because you don't care about yourself. Focus on yourself. If you told someone something you wanted don't wait for their reaction. What you wanted is already in motion if you act on your wishes.,341,30,5/24/2020 8:17,gpm18f
mentalhealth,A <1 minute exercise to connect with your feelings. All you need is a mirror,"Here's a quick experiment if you haven't tried mirror work before.

Let's do this one without too much thinking and rationalizing, OK?

It will be worth it, I promise.

Afterwards, drop a comment or hit reply to share how it felt.

**Before you do this mirror exercise read this**

* Find a mirror where you can be alone and undisturbed
* Then look at yourself. Really, look into your eyesNo preening, no posing
* Breathe slowlyUnclench your jaw
* Ease your shoulders down
* Unclench your toesOne more breath

Now say to yourself:

>I love you  
>  
>I am going to take care of you  
>  
>You're going to be OK

Yes, you can say it out loud.

No overthinking. Just do it.

&#x200B;

**How did it feel?**

How did you see yourself?

Did you feel any tenderness towards the face in the mirror?

Did it feel strange or emotional, or just indifferent?

I don't know about you, but I felt like crying. In a good way.

It felt emotional and tender. Like a step towards accepting and loving myself.

I saw myself as a little vulnerable, but felt lighter afterwards. Like I was going to be OK.

That's why I am sharing this with you.

If you find it helpful, please share it with a friend who needs it <3",It felt weird to me. I felt very uncomfortable and like i was lying or didn't deserve it.,340,29,11/18/2020 21:25,jwot1w
mentalhealth,I ate 2 full meals today,"I’ve been having a very difficult time eating as of late, I lost 8 pounds in the last month unintentionally.

I’m very full, but I did it, and I’m gonna keep pushing and hopefully maybe even have something to snack on tonight.",Hell yeah fox good job keep getting those meals in,342,28,10/8/2020 2:33,j74w53
mentalhealth,Making effort with people mentally drains me,"I’ve [24/f] always been terrible at responding to texts, answering phone calls, joining FaceTime group sessions, and being outgoing. I don’t know if it’s some deep rooted fear of rejection or what. I remember when I was younger, I was so so scared of going to peoples doors to ask if they wanted to come out and play, and the one time I mustered up all my mental strength to do it, the mum told me that my friend didn’t want to come outside to play. It sounds like a small thing, but I remember how badly that set me back. 

Now, I’m 24 years old and struggle tremendously with making effort with friends. Sometimes I doubt if my connections with friends is even real, because I act different with all of them. I adapt, and have done for years, and it’s tiring. I’m just at a stage in my life where I want to address what’s going on with me, and try to better myself. My flat mate has just messaged me asking if I want to renew our house contract for next year (which I don’t) and as a result I’ve been suffering from crippling stomach knots all morning and have been running on and off to the toilet. 

I don’t know if any of this makes sense at all? Or if my point is even clear? I just want to know if anyone else experiences this. It would really help to know I’m not alone. What have people done to overcome this?

EDIT: thank you everyone so much. I closed this app for weeks and didn’t expect to open it to such a wonderful response. You’re all such a comfort for me, thank you for sharing your experiences","You’re absolutely not alone, I’m 20 and everything you said there resonates with me completely. I have one friend who I feel comfortable talking to but even then I’ve noticed that I’m not entirely me when I’m with her. I get that feeling that I’m not good enough so I tailor my personality to the people I’m with to the extent that people have told me what they consider my traits to be and none of them are right. You are so not alone, I don’t understand why I’m like this either but talking through it with strangers can be surprisingly constructive :))",334,24,4/6/2020 8:59,fvvdq3

For some reason I asked one of my managers to come into the break room. I told him how my fiancé has been strugling with depression and about her suicide attempt, and how its been affecting me at work. Tears streaming down my face, but I made it to the end and told him everything.

I feel so stupid now.

The manager was so supportive. He said that there is life outside of work. That mental health is important.","I know you don’t feel like it, but the fact that you told your manager is amazing.

mentalhealth,Just another rape story,"Hello, trapped in quarantine here and nobody to talk to so I’ve chosen to write it out. I (24f) was raped by my own cousin for over a year when I was 14 years old. Story started with force, him moving my hand, forcing my head down, holding me down, locking me in cars, etc. Same things that are pretty common with those raped by family members. What I want to talk about is the aftermath. What nobody really realizes. My virginity wasn’t lost the same way as my friends growing up, I felt my body was meant to be used because that’s all he told me I was good for. So I believed him. After having that happen to you for that long you begin to go numb. It starts out with fighting then when you realize there isn’t anything you can do after fighting screaming and clawing you way out for months you just give in and want to get it over with. I don’t feel like my body is mine, I don’t have a connection with sex. I hear stories of people having sexual partners because they are in love or want to share that with their partners, but I have always viewed sex as my duty. It was my job to make men feel nice, I never had a right to say no. Still feel like I don’t. I don’t have connections with people, every friend I push away because I don’t “fit in” with them. I’m disconnected from what your typical 24 year old would want to do (drink, party, yoga, etc) my focus for the time I’ve grown up is to just make sure it doesn’t happen again. Survivor mentality if you will... I’m not saying all this to feel sorry for myself. It happens to a lot of people. But what happened to me made me feel like a outcast, I can’t share “losing my virginity” stories because it wasn’t funny or cute. I can’t stay in relationships with... well anyone because I don’t trust people because if family can hurt me in that way what’s to stop others. I don’t talk to friends (don’t have any), I’ve lost a lot of my family due to what happened and the family I haven’t lost like my mom, dad, and brother I don’t talk to them anymore because they don’t understand why I’ve changed so much from the happy go lucky “pretty teenage girl” to the cold hearted one I am today. Nobody can help you but yourself. I’ve been told over and over again to “just get over it” but here we are, 10 years later. And I’m over what happened to me, it doesn’t haunt me like it use to. But that doesn’t mean it didn’t permanently change me. My ability to form relationships, my mentality, my hobbies, my happiness, or my thought processes all have been changed because of one person 10 years ago. So for those that have been raped, you don’t have to just get over it, you don’t have to just bury it, but you can build because of it. I’m a strong person because of it, just isolated. So if you guys have any questions like how to help those that have been through it I will try to answer to the best of my abilities as another survivor. Thanks for reading.

Edit: woke up this morning and saw the post get so much love! Thank you guys for sharing this, I hope it helps those that have been told over and over that it gets better to see from someone that has been through it, it really does get better.","You don't need to ""just get over it."" Your feelings and difficulties opening up are completely valid. I'm so sorry this happened to you. If you are able to get mental health care, you would probably benefit from trauma focused therapy. You deserve to have healthy sexual relationships if you want them and I think that doing some trauma focused work would help you do that, as well as work on being vulnerable with people. You are worthy of happiness and validation from your experiences. Remember that you're a survivor. Stay brave",332,30,6/18/2020 18:42,hbkbft
mentalhealth,Do you ever feel like you don't have the same thirst for life as others?,"I'm a 26 year old female, I have bipolar type 2, my mom died 3 years ago, however I am taking the right medication and feel good. My meds don't make me a zombie or stop me from feeling anything which is good. But does anyone else have this deep feeling that they just don't have the same thirst for life as other people (mentally ill or not)? This has just been my whole life, like embedded in me, I like going out with friends and all that stuff, being social, being out - but deep down I'd rather be at home, doing nothing.

This is made hard because my boyfriend is a person who loves being out and about.

I don't know, it's like I just don't have the same want to live life to it's fullest as other people do? Can't explain it the best really.

Ps - will be blocked if you come on here preaching of anything (you shouldn't be on meds, you should do this do that); this is a safe place to voice how you feel but not shove your opinion or your ""knowledge"" down everyone's throats","Same here. I began to notice that just after my Mom passed away (3 months ago). It does help to know that I'm not alone. But I agree 100% with you.

I know I want to live and do something that I'm proud of, but after everything that happened, it feels is not a priority.

Which makes sense given that we’re all hurting & can’t really make the space for supporting others, but surely it hurts when you pour your heart into a post & get a single upvote & no comments, you feel?

mentalhealth,My depression took my personality,"During my (f 20) teenage years I dealt with depression. At some point during that, it became all I was. As many people know depression can make you loose interest in things that previously interested you.
I lost all my hobbies and a big chuck of my personality. I was a shell.

I've since overcome that part of my life and am left with this same shell. I dont particularly have anything that makes me me anymore. I don't have the patience/strength to really finish anything I start (eg artwork or writing) and when I don't finish it it brings me down more.

Essentialy I don't have a personality. I think I'm very boring and have crippling social skills. I don't know how I would go about trying to fix this.

My lack of social skills (due to isolating myself through arguably the most important part of my life, development wise) has also resulted in me loosing all my friends and unable to reconcile or make new ones.

I figure I can't be the only one going through this or something similar and wonder why this big part of this mental illness isn't really talked about

Edit: to add further context. My depression was a big part of who I was as it had such an effect on my life so without it I feel like I don't have anything about myself anymore.","M 18 here. 

I have been in this exact same boat. Depressed, suicidal, extreme social anxiety, and one day after a really awful day it went away. Now I’ve spent the past year trying to discover myself. 

The most important thing is to try new things. Exercise, constantly explore new ideas, religion, physical and mental growth, and try to put yourself into social situations even if it makes you feel awful. 

Exploring and getting out of your comfort zone is the only way to grow. If you need to talk about this or need some help on where to start, feel free to pm me. I’m still long from whole and still missing a lot of pieces, but you are not alone, and there is hope.",332,37,4/23/2020 1:37,g6dwi6

mentalhealth,I let my social anxiety stop me from seeing my Dad for the last time,"My Dad had been fighting cancer for a couple of years and had been going downhill recently. He was admitted to hospital several weeks ago and, due to COVID restrictions, only one person could visit him a day. 

I have severe  anxiety about going into new places, that is manageable when I’m with my boyfriend, but when I’m by myself.... I just cannot cope. The thought of going to the hospital and having to navigate it myself was far too much. 

My dad got moved to a hospice last Thursday for palliative care. 2 people could now visit at a time! But we were so busy with work.... I had planned on going to visit on the Monday but we received a phone call Sunday evening saying he was now unconscious and likely wouldn’t wake up. Immediately, we rushed u but he more than likely had no idea we were there.... he passed away on Wednesday. 

If I had gone to the hospital I would’ve been able to tel him one last time that I loved him. Due to COVID I haven’t hugged this man since February, as even when the restrictions were slackened I didn’t want to risk passing anything onto a shielding person. If I had went to the hospital I could have wrapped my arms around him one last time. 

But my social anxiety held me back. And now I don’t know if I can live with myself.

Edit: I did not expect this to take off even half as much as it has. I want you all to know I have read every single reply and I will respond to each. I have had a pretty rough day and these uplifting messages have really gotten me through it. I’m going to try and get some sleep but I will definitely aim to respond to each of you tomorrow!

I can tell you this, she was elated when I told her my therapy worked and things got a lot better. I'm sure your father would want that too.

I used the chat line because I get too anxious when i have to talk on the phone and the guy was really helpful and he asked me if i had a plan and I lied and told him no because I was afraid of what would happen if I did tell him that I have a plan to kill myself so I told him that I was just having thoughts of suicide and that I didn't have a plan to kill myself. Then we just talked about what was going on and what's making me feeling this way and then we came up with a plan on what I could do tonight to keep myself distracted and busy and he gave me some coping mechanism that I could use. I talked to him for about 40 minutes and he told my that I could always contact the hotline again if the thoughts comes back. Honestly the suicide hotline did help me this time and I felt a little better after talking with them. So if you're having suicidal thoughts don't be afraid to contact your local suicide hotline it might help and if you have contacted the hotline before and have had a bad experience like I did the first time don't be afraid to try again because it kind of stopped me from doing something really bad tonight.,I had a lackluster experience with the suicide hotline. It just seemed very sterile. I volunteered not long after my call but found other work so never followed up. I have to imagine the people working those lines have some experience. I do think they care and try. Must be a delicate and difficult job.,333,22,10/12/2020 1:00,j9hazw
mentalhealth,Dad tried to commit suicide while on the phone with me,I never post on reddit but I just need somewhere to vent and advice so bad I’m so desperate. Today my dad called me and told me he was going to slit his throat with a knife he had in his hand the phone call lasted probably like 45 minutes of him just going into detail about how he was going to kill him self after the phone call and him drinking so drunk. It was so traumatizing to sit there and try to talk my dad down and nothing was working I was begging for him to not do it and how I love him and I had to have my boyfriend call the cops on him while I stayed on the phone... he kept drinking and slamming the drink down and everytime I was terrified it was his body slamming on the floor screaming “dad are you there!? Dad!!! Dad!!! Please!” And him just saying he can’t live and trying to give me information of his life insurance. He’s now in the hospital and I’m waiting till the morning to go talk to him because honestly I was so traumatized by everything I couldn’t go right away and see him like that drunk saying he wants to die.. I want to talk to him sober he’s an alcoholic and depressed and I just feel so bad for not going right away but I’ve had suicidal and depression problems in the past and he was so drunk I don’t think he’d remember me coming so I just wanted to mentally recharge so I can sit him down and talk to him about getting help because I feel like I have to be so mentally strong and be there for him it’s just going to be so hard to see him and have this talk I feel so awful and guilty and scared to say the wrong thing I don’t know how I’m going to find the strength I’m only 22 and he has no one else being that he’s driven many friends away with his alcoholism and all our family lives out the country I’m so desperate for any advice my heart is breaking and I don’t know how I’m going to do it,"Oh sweetheart, I'm so sorry. My dad used to call me while intoxicated, and one time he called when he'd fallen in the shower and thought he was severely hurt (he thought he saw bone, but it was chips of tile) and it was the scariest thing ever. I cannot imagine how you must be feeling because that is so much worse.

Right now it's going to be tough to get counseling, but if you can afford it, a service like Talk Space might be helpful. I have it, and I can check and see if I have one of those referral codes that help you save on a plan.

Either way, you're totally handling this right. Stop and process your trauma",330,20,3/21/2020 7:06,fmb46e
mentalhealth,It's my birthday today.,"It's my birthday. I'm 30. I made an appointment with a psychologist today to help with my crippling self-image issues, perfectionism, and newfound lack of motivation or passion for things I used to love.



I've talked to my husband about it and he is incredibly supportive, but I haven't told anyone else and feel very lonely.



I didn't think this is what I'd be doing on my 30th  birthday, but I am hoping I will thank myself for it on my 31st.



Thanks for listening.


EDIT: Thank you so much everyone for your support! It truly means so much to me to be able to share something like this and to receive so many positive responses. I have my first session in half an hour and I am getting so nervous for it, but all of the kindness I have received here is helping to keep me grounded. This is my first experience with this community, and I have to say you seem like an absolutely lovely bunch and I hope nothing but strength and peace for all of you.",Happy birthday love.

mentalhealth,A close family member passed last year due to mental health and substance abuse issues. Today is his birthday. Please read this.,"I wrote this last year when I found out he had passed.  It has just been sitting on my phone.  While the message is not a new revelation to anyone, it never hurt to hear someone say these things to me.  So I thought that I would share it.

&nbsp;

The path of life is not paved solely in joyous moments, there are twisted unknown parts that lead us through the darkest of forests, hills that seem insurmountable, rivers that we cannot ford, and past demons that others cannot see.⁣⁣


We cannot make this journey alone and we should not try.  We must know, and remind others, that there is always an ear that will listen, a hand to offer aide, a back to share the load, and a shoulder to cry on.  No one must ever think that they need to face these challenges alone.  Call on others and find the strength you need in them.⁣


Please know that I love you and that no matter the challenge ahead of you I will stand beside you.  Please do not think it will ever make you lesser by asking for help, it makes you stronger than you know.

&nbsp;

I miss you so much James.

Around a four months ago I came up with the idea of creating an instagram page to share my experiences of what I go through on a day to day bases, in hopes of maybe showing someone they aren't alone. My goal with this project is to hopefully find some people who are also struggling and have them share their story, (either with their name or anonymously if they prefer) in order to help spread awareness and help those struggling in silence. 

I am open to any feedback on the project or individuals who are willing to share their story with me and others.","If this is US based, you could call it ""Behind; Mental Health""

mentalhealth,"If you live in America, Good luck with affording Mental Health Perscriptions","Speaking from my own personal experiences, America doesn't care about your mental health. Do you need a new SSRI that's come out in the past 10 years that helps you a lot? How about you pay over $1,000 for it? Oops, you need that medication to save your life and don't have insurance? Sorry, here in America we don't consider mental health (or health in general) important. So I guess that just means you'll just have to go without it. Guess you'll just have to worry every day of your life about whether or not you can afford basic mental health care.

As of right now, I recommend to all of you in America to switch from your current pharmacy to Publix (or other cheap pharmacy) and get an RX card. I still can't afford Trintellix, but at least Lexapro has been around long enough to afford it. I'm so happy to have grown up in a conservative family that never got me mental health/ADHD help ever until I'm an adult so that now I can't afford it. It makes me so happy to be in a SOcIEty that belives my mental health isn't' important and that I should just ""suck it up"" and get back to work which I can't because of covid-19. :DDDDD",My brother has schizophrenia and without insurance his monthly shot is $1900.

mentalhealth,Men’s Mental Health - I’m here to help,"Hi guys - I’m a 19 year old male who has suffered with severe anxiety, depression, and OCD for over 10 years. I want to end the stigma surrounding men with mental health issues, and help others. 

If there are any men in the group that need a friend, someone to vent to, or anything at all, please message me. I am open to helping anyone, but I feel I’d best be able to help men under 30, just because of my life experiences. For reference, I am located in Virginia, but I’m happy to help anyone anywhere. 

I hope that someone will find this and will have the courage to reach out. My DM’s are a judgement free zone. 

(PS - I am not at all sexist and believe women’s mental health is equally important. I just can relate better to men and what other men may be feeling regarding the stigma.)","I believe all people have important input when it comes to mental health, even people who haven't suffered but know someone who has. But I would be careful with what kind of advice you give out to people. Most people who do message you will be incredibly vulnerable. And just because you've had mental health issues since you were 9 doesn't necessarily make you qualified to try to give advice to random people. 

If you're there to listen to them vent that's one thing, but giving advice at 19 can be relatively dangerous depending on what it is. I respect what you're trying to do just be very careful with what you say.",326,22,11/9/2020 14:40,jqyr25

mentalhealth,I'm a 40+ year old man with two young boys and a wife. I need to brain dump.,"Firstly, I just need this out of my head. I am not posting for attention or answers. I just need to get this all out without effecting someone else with my worries or just downright dumb thoughts.

I've been messing up again. Not knowing what's going on with schools and if they will close them again or if they will just keep going until kids start dropping. I don't know if I'm really worried if I've been made to feel that way. I don't know because the people in power are less honest than my 6 year old.

He's six. He was just 1. My other is 4. But he was just born it feels like. I'm 41. AND MY KIDS ARE 6 AND 4. How much longer do I have where I will be mentally fit to care for them? Or will I just be the old ass cranky dad who forgot what it's like to feel the magic of being a child? I haven't yet but one day I will. Will I make a big enough impact in my sons lives then when I die they will miss me? Will they talk about me with pride? Or will it be all the ways I failed...I'm so scared to screw up being a father that it is crippling.

My father wasn't a father. He was there. He didn't beat me or hurt me or scream at me. For that he would have had to actually care I was alive. I haven't spoke to him in years and I don't see that ever changing. My mom. My mother. The most racist, horrible, mean, scorned and damaged person I have ever met. I love her but I don't ever want to see them again.

I'm white. My wife is black. We have two mixed boys. The world is so messed up. Will my boys be treated different? Will they be looked down on? Will they not get chances because of it? Or will someone hand them something just because they are mixed? Why in the hell do I worry about this? Will they get killed at school? Will I be able to save them if they are in danger?

How do I cook a fucking hamburger on the stove without it turning to shit? I can't even fix the damn toilet that keeps clogging because I was never shown how to be a man and I know the world is different and It might not be right but It feels that way. I have nothing to be proud of. What my kids and wife? How in the hell has she not left me yet? I'm the most annoying person you could meet. I started puking again. I can't handle this. I used to be skinny and fast and strong. Now my knees hurt. The other day I hurt my neck from STANDING UP? It hurt for three days. I feel like there is nothing useful in me anymore. I'm 41 and anything that mattered is gone. Now I only have jobs. I have a job to raise my children to be great humans who don't hate. I have to teach my wife how to prepare for when I die. I have to make sure everyone is okay and taken care of. So when I die they are okay.

So what about while I'm alive? I get that I don't matter in the long run. My children do. But I am sick of being here. On Earth. I'm scared. I'm mentally alone. I make myself feel this way and I don't know why. I just want a life I can't have. I try to make things like they were...like all the horrid holidays when I was a child I try to make so beyond special for my kids that I've spoiled them and now nothing means anything.

I just want to feel like I'm wanted again. Not needed. I wish I had a friend. But I'm terrified of people. I can't even order at a drive thru without going into a minor panic attack and ordering too much. I'm starting to mentally crack at the smallest things. I don't yell or scream. I go sit in the garage and cry. So no one knows it. So when someone askes me why I'm sad and I explain it, they can't follow up with ""well what you need to do is"" ""or you shouldn't feel"". No shit. I'm not doing it for attention and I didn't say it was rational but I'm a grown ass man and I should not feel like this. I should not feel like I only matter because of ""responsibilities"". I just want someone to have a better day just because I am in their life. Why is it so wrong to want to feel good about something? To be noticed. For something besides ""can I have a snack"". Or because 99% of every decision that has to be made has to be made by me or it doesn't get made. I'm stretched too thin. I'm not superman. I can't do it all. I can't always make a decision. I'm human. And right now, I'm scared. And I'm not dealing with it okay. I knew that when I started to puke after I eat. There is this spot in the back and side of my mouth that if I tap with a straw I can empty my stomach in 10 seconds. So now I eat once a day. And I notice that my belly stays now. My whole life I could never gain a pound. 140 was the most I ever got. Then I was 160. And my stomach was gone. Now it was bigger. I was short of breath. My hair is gray in spots. I'm getting older. I'm already old. And one day I'll die. And idk what that is either. But I know that it doesn't matter what good I do, what will matter the most is what I wasn't able to do. The areas where I failed. Because no one is perfect. So I am going to fail. And that is the one thing I cannot afford to do.

I'm not asking for a pity party. I'm not asking for a damn thing. I just needed this out. But I will say that being a man makes this harder. Men are treated different when they talk about mental health. If I could just man up I would. And I do. Every damn day I man up. I do my job. I take care of my family and I'm damn good at it. But sometimes, it all comes in at me. Sometimes I get a chance to sit and think. And that is scary. I live my life on autopilot. When I stop to think is when it's bad.

I don't know any of you but I hope you are all happy. We live in an age where it's almost comical for people say they just want to be happy. But it's not. There is nothing wrong with wanting to be loved. Or wanted to be noticed.

&#x200B;

Edit: The best thing I did for myself was post this. I was terrified to post it and you made me not only feel welcomed, but that I matter. And I don't know any of you. You helped me cope. You gave me things to think about. You gave me hope and understanding. My wife and my children are my life and I am beyond blessed in life. I know that.

mentalhealth,My guinea pig died and no one cares,"My guinea pigs (Täpi and Triibu, Täpi died in 2016. They were brothers so Triibu has been alone for 4 years) have been my only friends for 7 years now.

 Täpi had a tumour and died at 3 years old. My mum was the only one to even acknowledge that I had the right to be sad but others were literally saying ""it's just a guinea pig, it's not like a dog or anything so it doesn't matter"".

I was really depressed after that and since he died in his sleep I got this habit where I have to check every 10 minutes if Triibu is moving. Their cage is in my room.

2 days ago I wole up in the morning and went to check on him but he wasn't moving. I rattled the cage cause even if he's sleeping he usually reacts to that.

He didn't.

I went downstairs and told my mum. I went outside. In a few minutes she came back and said he wasn't dead yet bus close to it and that I should go be with him. When I got there he was dead.

I couldn't even say goodbye.

And I had to dig the grave and bury him while everyone else was laughing and just chilling in the garden.

 And I can't sleep. And I'm sad. It's too quiet in my room, and all the noises are wrong.

Today my mum's been yelling at me all day to clean the cage and take it out of my room but I can't even go near it without crying.

No one cares. They think ahh whatever who cares about it but I do. He's the only one who's ever been there for me. And they just act as if he didn't exist.","I'm sorry for you losing your guinea pigs. Sometimes people have no empathy, a pet is a pet, no matter what they are you love them.

mentalhealth,"Am I a terrible person? My mom gives me so much anxiety and I feel like that anxiety will only be gone, once she's gone.","I moved out of the house 10 months ago. The main reason is my mother and our toxic relationship. I never realized how much anxiety she's been causing me, until it was gone. I felt free.
But every now and then, my mother would text me and guilt trip me into coming back. And that's when I realized the anxiety is not totally gone. Even though we're thousand miles apart, the amount of anxiety she's causing is the same. And i thought the only time I could get rid of it is once she's gone. I don't wish for her to be gone soon, but i have strong feelings about it. Am I a terrible person?
I don't have anyone to share this with because I know i'll be judged. All my friends have great relationships with their mother. And I come from a place with close knit families. These thoughts will sound horrible to them.","You're allowed to feel however the fuck you want to. If you are currently thinking that her death would easy your anxiety, that's ok.

mentalhealth,The system in American is directly related to the current mental health crisis sweeping the nation.,Does being unproductive make you feel worthless? Does the anxiety of paying for college only to work a job you have no passion for set you over the edge? We are basically paying our lives away to survive. We go to school to get a degree only to work a job to pay bills. I understand that are other routes to take but for a majority of people this is unrealistic. Not everyone has the capital to be an entrepreneur. Not everyone has the time to sit down and develop their skills. In American we are slaves to the system until we die. We work until we are full. We pay bills until we are poor. We are deprived of happiness through means labor to gain profit for people in power. Humans were not meant to work 40+ hours of week to have two days of freedom during the week. We are worth more than what we are able to produce to society.,I feel like this is accurate. It’s a fucking pressure cooker for some people. And many don’t survive the process. We need more empathy for others....IMHO,311,26,11/30/2020 22:02,k46evd

This response wasn't out of anger or annoyance, and for once I heard something in his voice that rang a certain sincerity.
We've been through a lot and there are bad bad days like today were he will sit and listen while I panic, and help me wade through the paranoia and negative self talk. This week has been hard as I'm coming off my meds because of the shutdowns, so I'm physically withdrawing from the lack of Seratonin and other things. All I have been hearing from him is support. I've been a mess. He knows when it's bad I shut down and not think or rather think to much.

Well my name is Miguel but my friends call me Mike, I am 23 guy that used to struggle with anxiety and depression until now, after a year with meds and therapies I can say I am depression/anxiety free! 

I had been dealing with it since my father passed away 4 years ago. 
Last year was a really rough for me, I was unable to go outside, going to the university even to clean myself, Everything was making scared I felt like it was no future for me. My notes were going down close to getting kick out of the university, lots of debts, No money incomes, sent tons of job applications and no answer, losing friends, weight,started with suicidal thoughs and close to getting suicidal tendencies, was hitting the bottom until I met my gf (current ex) a wonferful woman that helped me go through and push me over to see a specialist because I wanted to be better for me and for her. We are no longer together but thanks to her I am better now, I don't know what could happened if I didn't meet her, I will be forever thankful to her. 

Took me a year to seen my potential and what I was capable, Also to love myself again. Was a difficult journey I will not lie but trust me, it is really worthy. 

I really feel proud of myself I wanted to share my story of sucess to inspire other people that is possible to win a fight like this! 

Ps: Sorry If my english sucks, I am not a native speaker:(

Thanks for the gold you kind person ❤️","I am very proud of you! However, your story is really interesting to me. I've never seen my depression as something to beat, or even as something I will ever be able to beat, more as something that I will become more able to live with. I'm not sure what recovery would look like for me since I've had good periods and bad periods. I tend to think that recovery isn't linear, and I've come to accept the fact that it will always be there, and sometimes it will be bad, but sometimes it will be good too. And for me, being able to accept this is the mark of beating this illness, not necessarily being able to get rid of it. I was wondering what you think of this, and how you see your experience with depression and how it has been different for you?",316,14,7/27/2020 8:27,hyodt0
mentalhealth,Even if nobody reads this..,"writing is a form of therapy that releases the pressure in my heart and brain and allows me to cope. It helps me make sense of and mop up the gray matter. I have felt pain, I have felt joy, I have felt grief, and I have feared for my life but nothing matches the nameless emotion waging war on me. For those who don’t personally know me, I am making a drastic move for the betterment of myself and my family financially and this is the battle I’m facing inside. I’ve felt so absent from myself and completely empty. Watching my house go from years of being the safe place for sailors, laughter, gatherings, hot meals, and an ear, to thin bare walls and empty rooms broke me in ways I never thought possible. People I’ve loved have weaved in and out of those rooms without thought in search of a place to call home, and here I am staring at the worn paint and marks along the walls from memories of beer pong, twister, and indoor dodgeball amongst other absurd things, wondering where the time went and if I’ll ever feel family like I have over the several years I’ve built and nurtured my circle. I don’t believe for a single moment that I wasn’t meant to experience the connections and the love that I’ve felt here, but with that comes the inevitable goodbyes. The halting end of a time that saved my life. Nothing teaches you how to introduce yourself and part ways all in the same breath quite like the Navy, but it never gets easier. No more dinners with friends gathering around the table to feel a sense of family where our respective families are absent. No more beer pong nights with 90’s hits, or spontaneous card game nights. My world has fallen silent. Laughter became tears, joy became pain, and I don’t know what to do with the things that I feel. You’d think I’d be good at this as I’ve been away from those I love and grew up with for 7 years. However, I am not. I am truly weak inside and empty. I didn’t know how else to express the grief that I feel other than to write this out, though I know not many will make it this far into the novels that I write about my internal war. Please hold your friends close while you have the time, because tomorrow you could be moving across the country with nothing but a back pack and shoes and nobody to walk beside you. And that pain, I don’t think anyone deserves to feel.",Holding them close. Prayers for you homie.,310,10,11/7/2020 22:01,jpzbpv
mentalhealth,Schizophrenia is very stigmatized,"I was recently diagnosed with schizophrenia and this disorder is very stigmatized. People think we are going to kill people or obey the voices we hear. It’s all 100% not true. There are some schizophrenics who never killed people. John Nash, the mathematician. Brian Wilson, the singer-songwriter of The Beach Boys, Daniel Johnston. a singer-songwriter. We aren’t harmful, some of us are just scared. We don’t kill nor plan to kill you. We get paranoid but we try to heal it before it gets worse. To me depression can be just as bad as schizophrenia. Any mental disorder really can be just as bad as any disorder. Suicide being the issue.",100% agree here. When did you start experiencing symptoms of schizophrenia before being diagnosed? Or did you not notice it until it got really bad? I was told I may have early stages of it so I’m just wondering,308,28,7/17/2020 14:06,hsw9mm

mentalhealth,Is there potential for mental disorders to develop as a result of having toxic parents?,"I (17 M) grew up in a household with an alcoholic father who always put his hands on me and threatened to kill me, and a mother who constantly degraded me, undermined my accomplishments, and told me she hated me. Whenever I would get into arguments with my parents and would finally stand up for myself, they would play themselves off as the victim, and guilt trip me into thinking I myself was the bad guy. Recently I’ve been feeling a lot of hatred, anger, and insecurity about myself and others. I also find it hard to love people and understand relationships and communicate with people. Is it possible that growing up in such a low quality family setting has affected my mental health and how I interact with others? Any answers would be greatly appreciated, thank you.",Look into CPTSD,305,60,7/13/2020 6:40,hqaeih
mentalhealth,"My girlfriend died several years back, and I met someone else now for the first time, but I’m struggling with this a lot.","I’m 28 now and my old girlfriend of five years died soon after we graduated college. 

I loved that girl more with all my heart. We’d been together since high school and all throughout college. She was diagnosed with cancer a few months after we graduated and died approximately six months later. It was obviously very painful for everybody involved, but she and I made our peace. 

After that, I completely focused myself in my career, and I’ve seen a lot of success in it. I’m in a very good place right now professionally. To get through this, I refused to even look at any girl I found even remotely attractive for like three years. I just didn’t want to feel anything that would remind me of her. Regrettably, I think it’s made me somewhat of a cold hearted person, but it was just like the light of my life was destroyed. 

About a year ago, I met this one girl through a mutual friend, and something about her and I just kind of clicked. I’ve been official for about four months now, and I really like her; however, ever since I started to become close to her, I’ve been having these sort of panic attacks where I just can’t stop thinking about my old girlfriend. I repressed these emotions for so long it’s all flooding back to me at once and I can’t handle it. I haven’t told this new girl for obvious reasons, but I think she’s beginning to suspect that something’s up. 

I feel like I’m desecrating the bond my old girlfriend and I had by being in a new relationship. She was the girl I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. I don’t know what to do now. I just don’t. Things like this just make we wish I could be at work 24/7. Work has no emotion. It’s such a safe place for me mentally. Sure, it’s an incredibly stressful and high hours job, but work related stress keeps my mind off those other thoughts. 

I don’t really know what I was hoping to accomplish by posting this, but it feels a little bit better to say this on here.",You are honoring her by sharing your love.,304,21,3/24/2020 4:08,fnylu3
mentalhealth,"Seriously, thank you.","I just want to thank everyone on this sub for being so supportive of each other and making us loners feel like we actually have some friends.

mentalhealth,Is it normal to sometimes feel nothing at all?,"Sometimes I will wake up and I’ll just feel nothing all day. It’s difficult to explain, but everyone I know feels like total strangers, I don’t care about anyone anymore. I just feel completely bored, uninterested in everything. I’m still me and I don’t get those weird ‘my body isn’t real and I’m in a dream’ depersonalization thoughts. When people express fondness for me, I will feel upset because I don’t feel anything back. 

I will sometimes seek out material that upsets me deliberately in order to ‘snap out of it’ and feel something, but that doesn’t seem to work either. Usually I’ll experience intrusive thoughts and shame associated with those intrusive thoughts, but when I’m like this, I rarely get any and when I do, they don’t affect me. And then, at some point, it’ll just go away and I’ll be normal again.","This is emotional numbness. It's hard to explain to people who don't have it and it's harder for them to understand it when you're basically saying you don't care about them, or anyone, or anything really. 

I'm afraid it's unlikely for your emotions to come back on their own, but I find when you're not in a stressful point in your life, you can get inklings of feelings more",306,27,7/11/2020 11:40,hp8m4w

Does anyone else have this? Does anyone know why?","I do this too and idk why. I met a friend yesterday and he asked me if i had my phone and i instantly said  ""no i left it at home"" while i was litterally holding it in my pocket. I had no reason to lie?

mentalhealth,"Happier than ever, finally at the age of 23","It was my birthday yesterday and I realised that after many many years of self-harm, wanting to kill myself, spending months in overwhelming terror, needing constant medication just to be alive, I FINALLY can say with conviction that I am happier than I have ever been. Despite having more mental illness than way back when i use to self harm or want to kill myself, it just doesnt matter, I am finally not just alive but living my life and I love it. 

It really does get better friends, although I have been going through it for primarily the last 9 years, and new diagnosis/mental illnesses have happened, I am so damn strong today and know that I have and will continue to overcome mental illness and SO WILL YOU ❤",":)

mentalhealth,We are failing our children,"The mental health system for children in America is fucked. My daughter (11) needs more than once a week therapy but isn’t suicidal or violent and there’s essentially zero immediate help for her despite her school and I both understanding she needs more immediate care. I live in one of the best cities for healthcare (Boston), have good insurance and still - we have called over 20 child therapists that aren’t accepting new patients and have had Boston Children’s Hospital recommend a partial hospitalization program and guess what? There’s only ONE lone PHP program within a 40 mile radius of where I live that offers a program for children under 13 and it’s overflowing with no availability. This has been the most excruciating experience and I can only imagine how hopeless people feel in less populated areas with less access to healthcare. Why is it that we have to wait until children are suicidal in order to get immediate care?

I’m floored and at a loss and so sad that it’s this hard for my kiddo to get what she needs.

Edit: I want to clarify that she’s struggling day in and day out with depression, ADHD and anxiety - so much so, it’s been worsening, disrupting the classroom and the school (she goes to a private Montessori school because public was brutal for my kid) has urged her to get into a program before returning to school.","It's nice if parents can accept the fact that there child is struggling. My parents think I'm jokking. Depression since 7, suicide thoughts 4/7 days... and more attempts than anyone could imagine. I wish your daughter the best of luck! And I'm proud of you being the responsible parent!",301,26,2/19/2020 1:22,f62q8p
mentalhealth,Thank you Reddit from a mental health patient,"Just wanted to express gratitude to nobody in particular (although I guess to Reddit itself) for facilitating so many important subreddits to do with mental health.

I've been a passive Reddit user for a few years. But up until discovering places like this and /r/depression I actually had a very negative view of the social network. I see so much anger, nastiness and toxicity here that it's depressing.

It's nice that just as anonymity can breed all of that stuff, it can also allow strangers to come together to help one another through mental health problems. I think of it as the upside to all that bad stuff.","Reddit gets a lot of shit alongside its social media peers (rightfully so) but I think Reddit is the best of all of them. 

I have seen so much more positive from Reddit than other spaces. And yes, agree totally, the people in this forum and the platform itself as a result are great. Lots of people always helping one another",298,7,12/28/2020 15:30,klsj9p

I realize the mods are on power trips.

mentalhealth,I just cried for the first time in 4+ years,"So recently, as in yesterday, I cried for the first time in a long time. I’m currently a freshman on college and the last time I cried was sometime before high school so that’s at least 4 years.

During those 4 years I definitely had times I wanted to cry but I held it in because men crying is often look down upon by society

It was a weird experience, even after I got over the reason I started crying the tears just wouldn’t stop flowing and I continued to cry for like an additional 30 minutes for no real reason at all.

But I felt a lot better after I finished. This post is kinda a vent I guess, but I just want people to know that it’s ok to cry and honestly don’t hold it in. After you cry you will feel a lot better, I know I did.","I'm so happy that it all came out.

mentalhealth,Helping Others While Being Broken, Does anyone feel like they want to help others in spite of being broken? Like helping others gives you fulfillment and a false sense of completeness. That's what I always feel. I would love to give the world to anyone who needs it but I can't give it to myself. I keep on pouring from an empty cup. I'm empty as fuck and helping others seem like an escape from my own problems.,"Yep. It's a way to cope with low sense of self worth: help somebody else, get thanks and validation for it and then feel slightly better about yourself. There's nothing inherently wrong with helping others, but if that's the only way you're getting your sense of self worth then it can get a bit unhealthy. Work on yourself a bit and learn some self-validation. It'll help more in the long run .",299,37,9/3/2020 7:48,ilp6rp

mentalhealth,What happens after deleting social media,"For anyone who is considering deleting social media and having a break... DO IT

I've been off Facebook and Instagram since the start of the year and it's made a huge positive impact on my mental health so far. I'm more productive, more social with people who really matter, doing more hobbies and having a clearer mind in the morning (rule is I don't touch my phone the first and last hour of the day). My goal is to stay off social media for six months or more. 

Anyone else doing this also? 😊

*EDIT* 

For those who are saying I'm on Reddit - I totally agree that it is a social media platform however, I find this platform to be good for my mental health. It's a space where I can express myself freely and have other people who are in similar situations that are super supportive. I think most of us can agree that Facebook and Instagram are far more toxic.","I deleted my facebook years ago, and it was a real load off.",293,73,1/23/2020 10:04,esr13w
