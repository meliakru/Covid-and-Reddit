mentalhealth,To the person who deleted their post few minutes ago.,"I don't really know what's going on with you and maybe most of the people around you can't feel it too.You're not okay and things aren't alright,I get it.
But Ending your life doesn't have to be the only way.I have a cynical perspective on most of the things in life So just bear with me.
If you give up your life,either nobody will care or you'll hurt the one's that love you even though you don't come across them often.
Try to handle things one at a time with a thought that you don't have anything to loose Anyway.

mentalhealth,Depression does NOT mean feeling sad. Depression is a medical term for functioning below necessary levels,"Depression, and it‚Äôs synonym suppression are commonly used in medical treatment and diagnosis to indicate something is wrong and the affected system can‚Äôt adequately contribute to the rest of the body. So basically you can‚Äôt think and act in a way that keeps up with your obligations. So it‚Äôs not just feeling sadness. It‚Äôs not laziness, and it‚Äôs not for the sake of gaining attention.

It really does.","The thing is... somedays it‚Äôs like a switch goes off, and you are happy and you feel like you can do all the things you tried so hard to the day before, but couldn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs where it gets confusing for me. Somedays I feel so good, like maybe if I just tell myself I can, I will.... but then it doesn‚Äôt work like that and you feel like somethings wrong with yourself. Because I have good days, I feel like others look at me like there are just days I‚Äôm sad and don‚Äôt feel like it. But that‚Äôs not the case. I don‚Äôt find any of it to cute or quirky. I don‚Äôt like the vivid shaking that comes with the anxiety, or the entire sickness that overloads my body during a panic attack, or the fact that somedays I lay in bed crying because I just want to get up and shower, but can‚Äôt find the energy to get out of bed. Depression. Anxiety. They suck. More people need to talk about the truth of what really goes on. How we truly feel. The more we speak up about the darkness that it truly is, I feel the less people will look at it as something cute and quirky.

mentalhealth,Just because you‚Äôre struggling doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre failing. Big shout out to all in the community who made it through another day. You‚Äôre all amazing. You got this.,,"The way I like to look at it is that ‚Äúlife is like a video game‚Äù. I usually use Pok√©mon because that‚Äôs what I know. Your mental illness is like all the Pok√©mon that hide in the grass and you have to battle. Sometimes that can be a real pain in the ass. Then you start leveling up or you move to a different area and the random fights get easier. They‚Äôre still annoying and you still have to deal with them but they‚Äôre just part of getting through.  
Basically, you have to struggle through a level sometimes but as long as you stick with it, even if you get set back because something didn‚Äôt go right, you‚Äôre still gaining EXP and learning.

As I was walking out of her office I said ""I swear to God I'm gonna kill myself"" & she said ""Okay, kill yourself"". I turned around & said ""what?"" & she said ""Go ahead, kill yourself, go on"" & I stormed out, had a panic attack & called my sister. We went back to her office & she didn't want to speak to us & instead sent her secretary to talk to us. He told us to follow him outside, took us to the parking lot, yelled at us, squared up & called us sick. He said that since we are ""sick"" we should be careful. I told him that the doctor couldn't say those things to me & he said ""Who's the doctor? She is, so she can say it & you said it first."" Then he cussed at us & told us to leave. I have the audio recording of the secretary yelling at us & stuff. My parents are really mad & wanna report her.

mentalhealth,"Just because some people don't make a scene of their mental disorders, doesn't mean they aren't struggling","Just because some people don't look or act mentally ill, that doesn't mean they don't have a problem going on. If they are trying hard to hide it, it's possible they're struggling more since they have to hold it in. Also, if someones symptoms don't seem as severe as your own, that doesn't mean they don't have a problem and therefore aren't entitled to get help. Kids shouldn't need to come out about being depressed by attempting suicide because they have no other way to prove it's a real problem that they deal with. And they definitely shouldn't have to go as far as to commit suicide to show they've struggled.

&#x200B;

I want people to get help without being told their OCD is for attention, and that their depression is just an excuse to be lazy, their anxiety is just an excuse to avoid doing things, or their ADHD is just an excuse to misbehave. If people are so worried over others faking this stuff for pity, then maybe don't give them pity and that's the problem solved then? Instead of giving them the things you think they're faking problems to get, try to push them to see professional help and leave it at that instead of going out of your way to make it worse for them.

&#x200B;

Nobody should be allowed to do terrible things and get away with it by blaming their disorder, I get that. If someone you know is doing that, treat it like the law does: don't punish or hate them, but maybe send them to a psych ward to get help if they truthfully are harming others because they can't control themselves.

&#x200B;

If anyone out there is afraid to come out about a struggle of theirs because they're afraid of being called an attention seeker, don't hold back because of people like this. Know that bottling it up will make it worse over time. Tell someone that will understand (maybe a school psychologist or a doctor) before it becomes too severe to fix easily. Once you do that, it will be so much easier.","> Kids shouldn't need to come out about being depressed by attempting suicide because they have no other way to prove it's a real problem that they deal with.

‚ÄúBut it will be the most dominant part of you. Think of your body - if you break your shoulder, even after it heals it will be tender. It will be a sore spot. You will be careful with it.

tl;dr
i survived a school shooting and i feel like i‚Äôm dreaming","Get a therapist, sounds like trauma. Someone to help guide you through managing the symptoms would be ideal.

Read into DPDR and how stress causes it, that's what the ""not real"" and ""foggy"" symptoms are. There's a survival mechanism in the brain of sorts that makes you disassociate under stress (car crashes, etc), but it can be stuck ""on"" for long periods of time. There's ways to manage it, and eventually you can get those symptoms under control. I have some experience with DPDR, you might want to look into strategies for staying grounded.

It's common to feel unsafe around things you associate with an extremely stressful situation. Getting around or managing that is going to require a trained therapist.

Abandoned by parents, raised by grandparents, abused by neighbor from ages 5 to 8, horrible abandonment issues, started getting into drugs, dropped out of high school, got a GED, some life happened, was totally Goth, some more life happened, made some music and art, now only Goth on the inside, started college, got married, wife left and grandparents arrested/institutionalized due to Alzheimer's/dementia in the same weekend, abruptly left college to move home to sort everything out, oh hey drugs, slowly watched my only family deteriorate before my eyes until they didn't even recognize me any longer, raging heroin addiction to try not to feel any of this, grandfather died, got in trouble with the law, lost everything I owned, homeless junkie interlude, lost almost 3 years of my life in jail/prison over less than $4,000 worth of bad checks, oops can't get a decent job due to criminal record, congestive heart failure, almost die, start getting my life back together, meet a nice girl, marry nice girl, grandmother dies, oh hey again drugs, finally got off the drugs, surprise wife departure, heart failure keeps getting worse, can barely walk, can't work anymore, no job, no insurance, no access to healthcare.

That about sums it up the backstory. I finally have gotten some healthcare and counseling. Sadly, I can no longer work. I'm trying to go through the disability process, but that takes a great deal of time. It is difficult without proper access to the doctors I need, but I'm getting there. I've also been clean for 4 years and I'm never going back to that dependence. Never before in my life did I ever feel like I was completely done with drugs, but this time it has really stuck. Haven't even had any cravings and now it never even crosses my mind. I'm finally in a good and stable place in my recovery.

Now I have other issues though. Poverty is very real. The threat of eviction looms nearly every month. Being able to afford the 12 different prescriptions I take is really hard and I find myself cutting pills in half because even $70 a month for medicine is a real challenge. I was able to get enrolled back in college and that is the plan of how to survive until I graduate and find work I'm physically able to handle. I'm working towards a career in counseling because I want to be able to use all of these nightmare experiences to help other people. I want to use what time I have left on this planet to help others and hopefully leave it better than I found it.

That is how you end up alone on your 40th birthday, typing on an ancient laptop that you pray survives a couple more months until you transfer schools and can get a replacement with financial aid funds. My family died. Drugs pushed everyone away for years except other drug addicts and an addict isn't anyone's friend. I am no longer able to work, so I don't have those human connections anymore. My wife had been my best friend, so when she surprised me by suddenly leaving the last person I had a connection with went with her. Now that my congestive heart failure has progressed just walking enough to shop for groceries, take out the trash, or getting the mail is a huge challenge, so just going out to walk around and meet people is near impossible. Having zero available disposable income also doesn't help. If I can hold on a couple more months and everything works out I'll be able to switch schools and have more aid options that will take care of my financial and healthcare needs. I'm just trying to hold on and it is so hard.

There is the abbreviated story if you somehow stopped on this post and actually read through everything. If you made it this far, thank you for listening. If you have the time to say happy birthday or say something nice I would really appreciate it. You really don't know how much it would mean to me. No one else is going to tell me today, so you might get to be the only person that wishes me a happy birthday. I don't get any presents or any cake. I don't get a birthday meal or get to do anything cool. I don't get to go anywhere or see anyone. There won't be any birthday cards in the mail or celebratory emails. That's okay though. If one person manages to take the time to read this and let me know there is someone, anyone out there then it'll be alright.

mentalhealth,I'm so happy I didn't commit suicide last May.,"I was at such a low point. I voluntarily checked myself into a psych ward last May because I found myself idealizing suicide, drawing up plans to end it, and getting my finances in order...I gave most of my things away, said my goodbyes, even wrote a letter... I'm currently sitting behind my desk at work - my boss isn't in and I have my own office so I'm completely alone, with no one to bother me. I get paid well for my position, along with being a student. I've become an EMT, I'm finishing up my dual degree in computer science and mathematics, my relationships with the people who matter most to me are at an all time high. I have self-worth, confidence, I'm making healthier physical health and mental health choices, I'm achieving all of my dreams and aspirations...and I'm happy. I'm genuinely happy. I compared how I am doing this summer to last summer, and the improvement is MAGNIFICENT. I now enjoy life and see that there is SO much to live for.

It's tough at times. Sometimes it gets really lonely, dark, empty....lifeless...but that's not true. Your life is full of life because YOU'RE alive. You have so much potential. You just need to tap into it. I did it... and I'm finally in a better place after 5 years of a shit storm - you can, too! I promise! (: Hang in there friend.

mentalhealth,"A seagull ate my hotdog, and I realised how much I want to be alive.","Today I rode to the beach. I bought a hotdog and a seagull swooped from the sky and nipped it and dropped it on the floor. I quickly picked it up and in my fury said ""fucking bullshit"" and ""I will not allow this seagull to get the better of me and stop me enjoying this hotdog I paid for"" and quickly ate it anyway. Gross I know but it was a very quick nip and it was on the ground for less than a second. Anyway after I ate it I started getting anxious about ""what if I contract bird flu and die"" and started to overthink a lot about what diseases I could get and so on. I started to think about if I died how much I'd miss my friends, my family and how there's so much I still want to do like meet my future wife, have a family, help people, build a career, play xbox, play with my dog and enjoy surfing etc. And because of this I realised how much I actually want to be here and how much I love being alive and don't want to leave. 

A few months ago I was in a really dark place and I was getting scared I'd never see the light and it would just keep going downhill, and today a seagull stole my hotdog and I realised how happy I am and how far I've come, and I'm really proud of myself for improving my mental health and look forward to all the beautiful and exciting things to come in future. Hopefully you had a laugh at this situation like I did, and maybe find something in it if you're struggling. And watch out for those airborne demons next time you get a hotdog.

Being broken is not beautiful, being broken is sobbing uncontrollably when you have a delay getting your meds refilled while your boyfriend strokes your hair trying to convince you that things will get better. 

Addiction is not the modern day version of Romeo and Juliet, addiction is an stable & irreversible at best or a death sentence at worst.

mentalhealth,"If you are suffering from depression or suicidal thoughts, this the wisdom I‚Äôve gathered since my suicide attempt a decade ago.","First and foremost you need some rest. I would say that 10/10 times when I have suicidal ideation it‚Äôs also when I am over tired or over worked.

Secondly there are people in your life that genuinely care enough to force you into help. I know it‚Äôs scary to reach out to them and admit that you are having a hard time alone but I whole heartedly recommend it. I would not be alive to type this if it weren‚Äôt for the wonderful people in my support network. One method my friend and I came up with is that I can kill myself, I just have to get his permission first. This gives me the benefit of having the ‚Äúoption‚Äù but also puts the social pressure on me to never do it. 

I know you might think no one gives a shit, but the same people who would be devastated if you died would probably prefer to help you out before it gets to that point. There is something socially validating about suicide in the brain of the suicidal. It feels easier than to admit you are having a hard time. You feel like people will take what you are going through seriously. But plain and simple you will not be around to enjoy that validation because you will be dead. And all the people who would have helped you will be asking what they could have done. Instead of leaving the people you love on this Earth with the trauma of dealing with your death, please reach out to them.

Lastly what you have gone through is not easy. You may feel exhausted, defeated or even angry at others. Self reflection might be productive but you are right to feel angry at how they treated you. What you do with that anger is your responsibility now and it seems like you are just letting it eat away at you. Maybe there is some way to can transfer that anger into productivity or artistic expression. Who knows?

You have real problems. They suck, you‚Äôre totally right to feel that way. You should feel no blame that shitty things happen to you. But these problems are still your responsibility. And there are people out there who can help. Again I would not be alive today if it wasn‚Äôt for the friend I mentioned above and a wonderful therapist who came in at the right time. You may not have luck the first few times; my first therapist sent me into a mental breakdown. But I promise you that you will find the right fit if you keep trying.

Focus on the problems that you can solve. I think about the serenity prayer they say in AA every day. ‚ÄúGrant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference‚Äù. There are many issues in your life you may not have control over, but there are some that you do. Focus on those. Try to define them as precisely as possible. Don‚Äôt say ‚Äúeverybody hates me‚Äù. Say ‚Äúeverybody hates me when I ______‚Äù. The first is a cry of defeat. The second gives you a concrete area of yourself that you can improve. I always tell my friend ‚Äúif you are going to hate yourself, at least be more specific‚Äù.

There is so much in life worth living for. A beautiful sunrise, your daughter‚Äôs graduation some day. Hell even if it‚Äôs just a new season of a tv show you love. The future is a mystery, and that‚Äôs a good thing. It means that everything is going to change. If things are good they are going to get worse. But that also means if things are bad they are going to get better. Take solace in that during the bad times and prepare yourself what things feel like they are going too well.

Don‚Äôt hesitate to dm me if there is anything I can help you with. We‚Äôre all on this crazy ride together.

God bless.

I hope that this post does not glamorize suicide attempts in any way. Yes I tried, but that doesn‚Äôt delegitimize the suffering of someone who hasn‚Äôt. Just because you haven‚Äôt attempted doesn‚Äôt make your situation any less valid or serious compared to anyone else‚Äôs. Remember my words above: a suicidal persons warped sense of reality tells them that suicide is a better option than reaching out for help. It is not. Ever.

Many of you have reached out to me in a PM and I thank you for reaching out to someone. I am always a friend in need to someone but I am not a professional. There are REAL professionals out there making a difference just waiting to be the change you need in your life. Remember the best thing you can do is reach out.

More funding needs to be put into this. (also I wish society was less toxic and 'edgy' towards each other but I digress)

I myself am doing okay but I can't imagine the pain others go through when they're told that they have to wait several weeks or even months to get their next appointment and how agonizing it can be.

Last month I started dating a guy who I love more than anything.

I don‚Äôt even remember why I was so upset, but I know it was right before I dropped out of school and cut ties with a best friend who treated me terribly, and I was just venting to him about how I didn‚Äôt know what to do with myself or whatever. After explaining my situation for a couple minutes he asks my name again, and then he says we have spoken before. He had remembered that I liked going for drives to clear my mind and remembered how I had told him about my friends that had been sent to jail and he asked how they were doing. I can‚Äôt deny that it brightened my day, I appreciated him so much. He told me about how his daughter also struggled with school and he understood what it was like.

mentalhealth,I got an apology from my old psychiatrist,"When I was 13 (around the early 2000s) my parents got worried as I was making the transition from elementary school to middle school. They had me see a psychiatrist who did no testing or talking with me before writing me a prescription for some SSRIs. The dosage was very high and my parents weren't told to taper me on or off. 


I had intense sleepiness, trouble caring about things, trouble remembering my friends' names. I slept so deeply that I didn't even wake up to my body's signals to use the bathroom; I was a teenaged boy pissing his own bed. My grades plummeted and that made my parents simply insist on higher doses. The psychiatrist I was seeing wrote those prescriptions too, still never looked me in the eye. 


I knew something was wrong, but it was months before I could focus enough to tell my parents. Luckily they listened and I never had to take those pills again. But for the next 18 years I went through life blaming myself for not adjusting to a new school quickly enough or well enough. When I was old enough to make my own appointments, I spent hours and hours (and hundreds of dollars) getting evaluated for every possible mental illness. I even had blood tests. All the tests came back saying I was normal and healthy, but it still tugged at me. 


A few weeks ago I found the courage to find that psychiatrist and then I wrote him a letter asking for an apology. I was respectful, stating the facts of the matter first and then moving on to how it made me feel in the years afterward. I was clear that I only wanted an apology, but didn't want to smear his reputation or harm him. I told him that he could reply or he could not, and if he didn't reply I wouldn't bother him further. 


Today he found me via Facebook and apologized. The relief and the confirmation I felt was nearly overwhelming. 


I spent years thinking I was weak, dangerous, crazy, and unreliable. But I'm not. I am sane. I am strong. I am dependable. I DO deserve the good life that I have.","wow. i am so so sorry you had to go through that. that must've been so turbulent. the physical side affects sound absolutely horrible, and to top that off with the emotional harm done...? whew. all i can say is you're an incredibly, and i mean *incredibly* strong person. i'm so glad you've come to the point of realizing how deafeningly true your last couple of sentences are.

i must say....... you're remarkably respectful. it's really healing that you don't seem to harbor any ill-will towards him; that would do you more harm that it would to him. you're past this and that's all that matters.

that being said.... **FUCK THAT PSYCHIATRIST**!! holy shit. the physical, emotional, and even financial damage that he caused you is insane. i know nothing, but honestly.... it sounds like you could have a pretty favorable law suit on your hands. again, im not a professional so this is only speculation, but here's a site below i found concerning it.:

mentalhealth,Why isn‚Äôt there a such thing as an urgent care designed specifically for mental health emergencies?,"Why do emergency rooms exist for physical or extreme mental concerns but there is no such thing as a walk-in urgent mental health clinic?

I‚Äôve wondered this for years. I‚Äôve always had a panic disorder. During my first terrible panic attack at 21, I remember googling different mental health facilities in the area and limited info came up. I ended up calling the cops because I was afraid and felt like I couldn‚Äôt breathe, but knew it was psychological. The cops showed up and the only assistance they provided was suggesting that I sat in the back seat of their car. I felt ashamed sitting there, and as my panic dissipated, I just remember feeling hollow and empty. They couldn‚Äôt help me and unless I was truly a danger to myself or others, they weren‚Äôt going to commit me to any psych wards. So, they left and told me some ‚Äúmobile counselors‚Äù would be on the way.

Eventually, I went back home and sat alone for 3 hours, trying to relax. These ‚Äúmobile‚Äù counselors the cops said they would provide me with decided to give me a call and ask if I still wanted help. By that time I was fatigued, so I declined.

That‚Äôs when I came up with this question. At that moment I would‚Äôve loved to just walk into a place and talk to a counselor on-call. Not days or weeks of waiting to talk to a psychiatrist or therapist, nor being committed to a psych ward. Just real people with crises that they need help with.

Helplines, in my personal opinion, aren‚Äôt the same type of treatment. I‚Äôve only tried a couple though, so I‚Äôm not entirely certain on it. Though, in some cases, slight medication intervention might be necessary, and personally I prefer a face-to-face conversation. 

In addition, if this concept could actually work, what would one have to do in order to be able to open such a place?","I‚Äôve wondered this, myself, for years. I think that a lot of people could benefit from walk-in mental health clinics

I looked it up again just now and it looks like a mental health management company called Beacon opened a walk-in mental health clinic inside of a Walmart in Texas late last year, which sounds fascinating

It would be amazing if this could become a trend and makes mental health care more accessible because when I first started getting help for my issues the whole process sounded confusing and scary. Not to mention, I had social anxiety that was so bad that I could barely make phone calls and would either put them off for as long as I could or not make them at all

However I have also noticed that I feel this same way when I am on good terms with myself.

Therefore, there may just be an issue with trust. 

The discomfort we feel when receiving a compliment or when a kindness is done on our behalf may be closely related to our past experiences where a person's kind actions were due to unkind intentions.

Not only do we lose trust in that person (these people), but we also lose trust in kind actions on our behalf altogether.

If this isn't you then yes it may be about how you feel about yourself. 

In either case, in order to overcome this insecurity, we must learn to show appreciation. If not for their intentions then for their actions. Find any perspective that allows you to feel appreciation. Get comfortable with expressing gratitude.

Self-pity and self-loathing is a crutch, as well as a barrier, to great potential. Seek any path around these. Especially if you have any reason to believe that these aren't the direct source of the problem.",470,22,9/6/2019 17:36,d0judl
mentalhealth,It's okay to be a male with mental health problems.,"Kind of an inflammatory title but it comes with a story and a bit of advice so buckle in.

Growing up I didnt have any problems with mental health. I was raised southern Baptist, worked on cars with my dad while still in diapers. When I could walk I learned home improvement, drywall, painting, ect. I was raised to be strong, protect my sisters and my mom. I was raised that men dont cry, men dont hurt. I grew up thinking that I had to be strong in all moments and never let down my guard. 

Fast forward to 2 years ago. I was driving home on the not so good side of town very very late at night when I saw a guy leaning in the window of a car. (Drug deals not uncommon out in the open) He turned away from the car and jerked violently before falling down onto the street. I slammed my car to a stop, threw up the brake and jumped out, not knowing what was happening. 

I always carry a firearm on me and had it on my side. I approached the male laying on the ground when the guys from the car he was leaning in opened their door. When they stood up the only thing I remember seeing was the barrel of their gun. Couldn't tell you what they looked like, what color the car was, hell even if it was a guy or a girl. I pulled my weapon when I saw this and we both paused for what felt like hours, days. I wasnt breathing. We just started at each other while I was aimed dead in that person's chest. 

I didnt pull the trigger.

The person jumped back in their car and sped off after what seemed like an eternity and I holstered my weapon and ran to the guy in the street. He was shot in the lower left of his back, blood pumping out of a small circle wound. Holding pressusre on it with one hand and trying to dial 911 with the other I tried to stop and much bleeding as possible. After hanging up with 911 the wait began. 

I took my jacked off and laid it under him. (With it being cold out and him losing blood you want to keep his core as warm as possible. Help arrived almost exactly 1 hour later. My hand had frozen, literally frozen to this mans skin in a frozen seal of blood. 

Greg was his first name and he made a full recovery.

I moved on from that day different. Over the course of the next year I would have night terrors of the image of that gun, the blood pumping out of his skin, being alone with him desperately trying to keep him alive. I couldn't be in public with out my heart racing and having to leave. I didnt trust new people I was meeting. I was scared to be alone at any times. It came to a head when I tried to end everything. 

With out going into it to much I didnt. I went straight to family for help and explained everything. My mom took me in, I found a therapist that I enjoyed and got put on a medication to calm the terrors. The first time I talked to the therapist I cried. I cried and cried for the first time in my life. Cried like a baby and let all the manly machismo go. I was vulnerable and she held me through it. She understood and didnt judge. She saved me.

One year of therapy later I have a totally different outlook on mental health. After reading through this sub I figured this story could help someone. It is okay for men to hurt. It doesnt make you less of a man to be struggling with something. It is okay to break down and not have the solutions. 

Please, if you are someone who thinks you will be judged negatively for having ""something wrong"" or being broken in some way, there is help. I am forever grateful I found help when I did.

Sorry if the story is kinda rushed or mistyped, kinda a hard subject to bring up.

mentalhealth,"High schools need therapists and real resources for suicidal students, not just non-suicide contracts","First time posting here, please don‚Äôt mind the rambly-ness of this. Today I was thinking about something that happened years ago that made me realize schools don‚Äôt do much about suicidal students. 

When I was in high school I was severely depressed and going through a really difficult time in my life due to my parents divorce, particularly after being sent to live with my neglectful and abusive dad. I was self harming, battling an eating disorder, and was barely sleeping at night. I was absolutely struggling pretty clearly on the outside. I had a teacher tease me for looking so miserable at school every day and I got in trouble for being inattentive or dozing off in classes among my high-achieving peers. It was a rough time. 

I remember changing a password to something I accessed at school to iwannadie. It must have been flagged because I was sent to my guidance counselor, who really only ever gave people advice and help with applying to college, and she basically got me in trouble and threatened to tell my parents, and made me sign a contract that I wouldn‚Äôt kill myself. It totally cured me of all depression and I was never suicidal again! /s

Anyway, it upsets me that they didn‚Äôt do anything more about this. They didn‚Äôt mention it to my parents or anyone else, they never followed up again, and didn‚Äôt have a therapist or a professional to refer me to, in school or out. 

Schools need to have a resource for students. I was so vulnerable and depressed and I was shamed for it rather than helped. Guidance counselors don‚Äôt really have time for this, which is understandable, but they MUST have someone else there to support students during tough times if that‚Äôs the case.","This is sooo USELESS!! Schools  really should take it more seriusly. I got sent to a ""family counsler"" to help my depression in 8th grade. The problem was that she just said the same things my mom said and my relationship/comunimication with my mom was one of the big reasons I had problems... And all the sesions would start like this:

she: how are you feeling today?

me: aweful, I wanna die...

me (ironicly): A pink fluffy cloud  (In my native language that is what being in love is described in cliches: So its kinda the same as ""I'm on cloud nine"")

me: ....

I just went to her to cut class, and faked getting a bit better every week untill I was ""cured""...

mentalhealth,‚ÄúMaybe I should suicide myself?‚Äù,"Those are the words of my 9 year old son. Words he spoke the other day because he misses his 17 year old cousin who died by suicide 16 months ago. He wants to see her. Words I now carry with me every moment of every day. 

I was there that morning. I arrived right after the police. It was like a scene in a movie. Emergency lights flashed from every direction. I left my car in the middle of the road, door open, pushed past all the police in the street, and ran into the house. 

Looking back on that day I can see myself as if I was watching from above. My sister and her husband were inconsolable.  Police everywhere. The screams, and tears. All the phone calls. It‚Äôs such a blur. But what is clear are the moments I was able to sit with her before she was taken away. The quiet in her room was deafening. I wanted it all to stop. I wanted to turn back the clock. To have one more chance. As I sat there the realization hit me like wave. Everything had changed. I couldn‚Äôt stop it. Nothing would ever be the same again. My niece... she was gone. 

It‚Äôs been sixteen months and no one has ‚Äúmoved on‚Äù.  It‚Äôs something we carry with us every day. It‚Äôs part of all of us. That loss, the grief, the anger and disbelief. It makes every step harder to make and every breath harder to take. 

My niece was in pain. Blinding pain. I sat on the front steps that morning and read the note she left. 10 pages of writing as the drugs took effect. She was more afraid of waking up then dying. Those were her exact words!  She was only two months shy of 18, yet she couldn‚Äôt see the light her future held. Any hope she had gathered over time had slipped through her fingers. She couldn‚Äôt hold on any longer. 

I‚Äôm grateful that her pain has stopped but I wish she could have seen or felt the love she was leaving behind. The devastation that has ripped through our family is the result of the tremendous love we all felt for her.  She was our light. She brought so much joy to us all. Yet she struggled to feel any herself. 

Life will never be the same. People tell you that things will get better in time. A big part of me wants to scream that I don‚Äôt want everything to be ok because it‚Äôs not.  We‚Äôre not and never will be. We‚Äôre all a mess. My kids still struggle every day.  She was a regular part of their life. She loved them unconditionally and them her. How do you explain why this disease could take her away and why we couldn‚Äôt help her.  They are too young to have to deal with anxiety and depression, and loss. 

What I wouldn‚Äôt give for another chance to reach her. Knowing the pain she was in crushed my soul. She had the most beautiful heart. If only she could have felt how loved she was. 

If you are struggling with depression or thinking about suicide, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE reach out for help. You are not alone. You deserve to feel love and happiness. You might not feel it or see it right now but there are people who care, who see your worth, who understand your pain, and want to help.

mentalhealth,My depression is lifting. I haven't felt this happy in 3 years.,"My depression and anxiety had its up and downs ever since I first started working. It went downhill in March when despite having a great therapist and taking meds, I got very suicidal. I was on the edge of the subway platform. I felt like a failure.

&#x200B;

I've been on sick leave since then. I thought I had disappointed so many people in my life, but my therapist has helped me in forgiving myself and moving on little by little. I decided not to go back to my current teaching position for the next school year, which will cause financial instability, but I'm in such a better mentality. Being close with my mom, she has noticed that I smile and talk more, and that what she thought was ""normal stress"" was me barely managing my depression the past three years. I was desperate to ""fix myself,"" and to just ""suck it up because everyone has work stress.""

&#x200B;

I have so much respect for teachers. I am interviewing for other schools, but I will most likely do a mix of tutoring/sub work/reception. I am still sad that I couldn't push through another school year, but I am feeling happier that I don't have to go back. I have options. And maybe someday, I will go back to the classroom in the future. I'm working on hobbies I've completely abandoned when I was working. Teaching is a huge commitment. I have mixed feelings about my ideal work situation, but I'm glad I'm taking the time to reflect and slowly plan my next steps.

&#x200B;

My meds and therapy helped a little, but what I needed most was a change of circumstances. I am only human. 

It's still hard forgiving myself fully, but I'm trying.","I'm really happy you're feeling better. I know it's hard sometimes when you feel that way. I feel that too.

mentalhealth,I finally shaved!!!,"Before anyone asks: I am a girl.

I haven't shaved in months and if you're grossed out by that, stop reading now. 

I haven't shaved anywhere. Legs, armpits, pubic area. It just seemed too overwhelming. My boyfriend doesn't mind, so my sex life didn't really get worse because of that and I live in a colder climate, so wearing long pants during the summer was completely normal.

To be honest, I kinda liked how things were. Less waste, more time, less skin irritation and stuff. But I knew it didn't come from my worldview, but from my depression. Shaving is the least important, as I could go days without eating, without brushing my teeth and showering. 

So before I go on: shaving isn't necessary, showering is. So if you're a male, female, whatever, just don't shave if you don't want to. It's not a part of hygiene. You won't ""sweat more"" because of some hair. But take a shower from time to time. Not a full-on spa singing one hour shower, but get in there for a few minutes. Even if it'll be just standing under pouring water. 

But if you want to - just like I did - go for it. I shaved my whole body today, I used some coconut oil on my legs and scented oil under my armpits (zero-waste deodorant!). Apart from that, I also did a full on skin care routine and brushed my teeth AND flossed. Wow.
I'm sure most people do it regularly and it grosses them out when they have a single piece of salad between their teeth after a meal. But for me, it was a huge milestone. I hope to do it again tomorrow, without forcing myself. I haven't felt this fresh and sexey in quite some time. Next goal: laundry!",I‚Äôm so proud of you for taking care of yourself!

mentalhealth,"Mental illnesses do not affect us in equal ways, but they all suck.","My sentiments are based on being subscribed to the sub and seeing a pattern in which posts make it into my feed. This is not an attack on the sub, it's a suggestion to represent all the colors of the rainbow here.

This sub seems to mostly pay attention and support people whose mental illness makes it difficult for them to perform basic functions, like getting out of bed. I understand that life with mental illness is like a 10k race. For those struggling with the basics, every day moving a yard feels like a war against yourself, but what about those of us who are sprinting? 

I leave my house daily for work, social gatherings etc but I face many difficulties each day stemming from mental illness. I come here and I make posts about it. Hoping to find someone who feels the same. Who lives that struggle. Just one person who relates and reaches out and says yeah I'm drowning in my own thoughts too. Or hey I used to struggle with that here's what helped me. 

But I get nothing. And I see no posts on my feed from others who live a similar struggle. I'm sure they're out there, but their posts get buried or if they're anything like me, they delete them later because if no one feels the same, what's the point. All the support goes to the ones who seem to be struggling the most outwardly.

It reminds me of when I was a kid, and I had a troubled sister. I went to school, had poems put in the newspaper, great grades and had a few short stories published in books, but no one in my home paid any mind. When I left for college I asked my mother why she left me to my own devices so often. Why she didn't put so much effort into me like with my sister. She replied; ""because you've always done so well on your own, I didn't think you need me."" That has stuck with me even to this day,and that's how I feel about this sub. 

The support isn't shared and I think we all could do more to make sure there's a variety of lifestyles affected by mental illness getting the attention they deserve. No struggle is worth more than another, but they all need some help.","I think you make a very good point for a number of reasons. Mental illness might not debilitate someone entirely but the fact they struggle is enough reason for support.

mentalhealth,Has anyone else had depression and other mental illnesses for so much of your life that you feel like it's part of your identity and as much as you hate it you can't imagine yourself without it?,"I'm 29. At age 13 I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and about six months ago I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. I also get anxiety attacks sporadically but never been diagnosed with anxiety to my knowledge. The first time I had mental health problems I was four or five years old. I got put into a psychiatric hospital for a week when I was five (don't want to get too much into why I was put in but basically I had extreme trouble regulating my emotions), and it was at that point that I internalized the thought (or message I thought I was getting) that I was bad and wrong and messed up. A year later my mom died from cancer and I thought I had made her sick because I stressed her out too much from being ""bad"". So again my vision of myself as a bad person was heavily internalized and confirmed. Then I went through bullying and teasing at school from age 8 to 12 because I was fat (from comfort eating because of losing my mom) and awkward and every demeaning thing the bullies said just confirmed my belief in myself being a disgusting ugly embarrassing pathetic piece of trash. Around age 10 was the first time I wanted to die. Age 13 I was hospitalized again for being suicidal. I've been on about 10-12 various medications (at different times) since I was 13 trying to treat my mental health. I have done probably 10 years of weekly therapy appointments. And despite all that nothing helped me 100% or even 50%. I still was depressed and anxious, I developed an eating disorder that went in and out of my life for 10 years, I still hated myself and had very low self-esteem and self-injured and felt suicidal and just...dark.

At 29 I still feel like I'm just destined to be this way. My biological father died from alcoholism after having it for about 35 years and he also had been diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder recently before he died. My mother's side of the family had depression and anxiety and food addiction. I just feel like I'm destined to be and stay mentally ill. And I feel like it's part of my identity. Ever since my mom died I've gone through life feeling isolated and different from everyone else around me. I feel I'm just a broken person and I've felt it so long I really internalized it at a very early age. I know it sounds ridiculous but since the dark, self-hating, self-sabotaging thoughts are all I have known for practically all my life, they are.... comforting to me in a strange way. It feels.... right? to just wrap myself up in a blanket of sadness and turn my back on the world. I can't see myself being any other way. I feel like it's formed my personality? I'm not really sure. I just... at this point in my life I can see how not fixing my depression and other issues will leave my life in ruins and possibly end with me dead by suicide or reckless behavior, or long-term hospitalized. Obviously neither of those I would like, but another part of me feels indifferent to that happening. Like, ""...meh, you're a piece of shit and so messed up anyways, you're just another human out of the billions of others contributing to the demise of this planet so it really wouldn't be a big deal and would be better in the long run.""

I'll end here before I continue rambling on. Basically, I feel like being mentally ill is embedded into my DNA and is in every part of me and I can't find the motivation to try to change it or even the belief that I deserve that change or that it will even ever happen. Additionally I feel like I have no idea who I would be without it. Has anyone felt this? Can anyone relate?","I'm 46/f and I lost myself to major depressive disorder, anxiety and PTSD over 7 years ago and it has been one hell of a fight. I experienced extreme emotional trauma from different fronts and it broke me. I've been through therapy, seen psychiatrists, taken different meds and, although that stopped me from crying everyday, it didn't stop the sadness. Over the last two years I have slowly found myself crawling out, although I've had plenty of back slides. I changed how I ate and have lost 80 pounds, which has helped with my self confidence. I started doing things for just me. I took a trip to the beach for several days, by myself, and it was the best, most relaxing vacation I have ever had. I also started just focusing on the now. What is in front of me? What can I control? Have I put myself in a situation that can cause triggers? Establishing boundaries is extremely important as is fighting the urge to feed that depression. That is the hardest part. You're so much better than depression tells you. I know that dark place and how easy it is to live there. Be your own cheerleader. Congratulate yourself on the smallest task. Be proud of what you can accomplish. That positivity can help boost those positive endorphins we seem to be lacking and help you continue pushing forward. I say all this to say, you are not forever lost to depression. It is not an easy fight, but it is so worth it. Keep pushing forward, ask for help when you need it and do not give up.",392,26,11/30/2019 22:47,e44yen
mentalhealth,"Six months after my suicide attempt, I‚Äôm traveling alone and loving life.","Almost exactly six months ago, I tried to take my life. I was misdiagnosed with MDD but after my attempt and hospitalization was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I was put on new medication, started therapy, moved to a new apartment and generally hit the reset button on my life.

Now, I‚Äôm traveling Europe alone for the first time. I‚Äôm doing what I want when I want, meeting new people, seeing things I never thought I‚Äôd see, and loving every minute of it. Every second I think about the fact that I could have not had this opportunity. I could have cut my life short and never been to Europe, never felt the freedom of standing at the top of a waterfall in Iceland or on the River Thames in London. 

I‚Äôm so thankful that I made the call before it was too late, and that I had people in my corner when I woke up in the emergency room that cold March morning. I‚Äôm glad that I chose life, despite how hard it can be, how cloudy and dark and hopeless it is at times. I‚Äôm glad that I sought help and got the help that I needed.

I still feel hopeless and lost and miserable sometimes. We all do. But I want every person here to take a deep breath before they consider ending their short, beautiful life too soon. You never know what more there is to see and feel and experience. I love myself now, and I love you all.

Cheers xx

Edit: Thank you all for your support! I wanted to clarify that I wasn‚Äôt meaning to brag or seem like I just dropped everything and hopped on a plane. I actually planned this trip back in January, before my attempt, which perhaps makes it even more profound. I was tempted to cancel the trip during my treatment and recovery, but after six months I‚Äôm finally trusting myself again and feeling connected to myself and the world around me. Getting on the plane felt terrifying, but I‚Äôm so glad I went through with something that is good for me mentally, emotionally and spiritually. It‚Äôs a chance to sit with my thoughts and take in the world around me. My Eurotrip can be your anything‚Äîgoing somewhere new or sitting in a park you pass everyday. I just want you to feel as alive as I do!

mentalhealth,"Does anyone else hate how people throw around the terms ""narcissist"" and ""sociopath"" on Reddit?","Narcissistic personality disorder is a horrible, painful condition. It's a mental disorder that, just like any, ruins the lives of people who never wanted to be this way. Like other personality disorders it takes away someone's control over their own thoughts and behaviours and twists their perceptions of the world around them. They've quite often been through abuse which has led them to develop their condition, and often they aren't even able to see that there's anything wrong - just like in other psych conditions.

Sociopathy hasn't even been considered a real diagnosis for decades. The closest thing is antisocial personality disorder, which is another horrible condition that people are forced to live with. It damages someone's ability to empathise and feel positive emotions, their ability to control strong bursts of anger or sadness and to properly deal with their emotions, and it makes people struggle to control impulsive behaviour and fit in with society. Someone with ASPD isn't the stoic, emotionless killer from a horror film or the cool, charismatic, cunning CEO. In fact they're very often poor and not too clever, having grown up in toxic environments and never getting the support they need to develop properly.

Both of these conditions are extremely complex and very, very hard to identify and diagnose, even for an experienced psychiatrist sitting across from their patient.

Reddit uses these terms the way people used ""retarded"" a decade ago. People have taken crippling conditions that they know fuck all about beyond watching slasher films and Dr Phil, and turned them into slurs.

It's even worse just how readily people make these armchair diagnoses. Whenever anyone does something bad, they must be a *sociopath!* It couldn't just be that normal people like you and me sometimes do bad things for a variety of very complex reasons - no, they must be a sociopath (and that means monster!)

Whenever a /r/relationship_advice or /r/amitheasshole post describes someone doing something that could even just be interpreted as slightly unreasonable, or a slight overreaction, they're a TOXIC NARCISSIST! No, they didn't just snap because they've been under a lot of stress like any human can, they dont just seem unreasonable because we don't know what's going on in their head and know their side of the story. No, they're a NARCISSIST! And it seems *everyone* on Reddit knows at least one narcissist, usually more.


And how do you deal with someone who has a debilitating mental health condition? You cut them out of your life completely! After all, they're toxic and they'll ruin your life if you let them!

Tl;dr ""narcissist"" and ""sociopath"" are the new retard, and it's disgusting.","I really hate it. And it's often used *in* the mental health community, as a way of passing the problem down the line. ""Hey, that's not [my condition], that's borderlines you're talking about!"" ""Hey, that's not BPD, that's narcissists you're talking about!""

Like get a freaking grip, stop it. It's not ok. It's not ok to shit on your mental health condition, and it's not ok for you to pass the shit down and punch down on someone else's condition. No, not even if you think that condition is ""bad"".

I'll tell y'all a 100% fact. I've seen people with NPD who hate their diagnosis. Who go to therapy and fight it every day. They know what they do, but like anybody else with something like ADHD (making them forget) or Tourettes (making them tic) or BPD (making them cling and cry), they have problems with their condition making them act certain ways and it is *hard* learning to get through that.

ASPD? I know an absolute sweetheart with ASPD who is completely officially diagnosed. He doesn't really feel empathy, but he *knows* he doesn't feel empathy and he's stubborn about not letting that make him a bad person. So he *chooses* to act nice. Not because he feels empathy, b/c he doesn't, but because *he wants to*. He's actually one of the nicest people I know, he really goes out of his way to be supportive.

I know plenty of people *with* empathy who could stand to learn a lot from him.

When we use these terms as synonymous for ""bad person that I don't like"", or when we simply plain punch down on people with these diagnoses, we are being everything we hate about neurotypicals that treat us badly for *our* diagnoses and *our* problems that we can't help, and who use *our* labels as insults.

But it was really therapeutic in a way, even if I was just outlining some of my struggles and basic battles I have with myself daily. Some of the things I said, she shook her head at, like when I said I have no reason to be scared of the fights in my house, cause I'm used to it lol. But yeah...

We came to the conclusion together, that I am fed up of being judged, and wanna change that and the hypocracy in my family. I just don't know how.

Your traumas are valid, your traumas are real. Do not invalidate them by saying other people have it worse. Everyone has their own story and everyone's traumas are important. Do not invalidate yourself by comparing to others. Relate, but do not compare.

mentalhealth,You wouldn't emotionally abuse another person so why would you emotionally abuse yourself?,"I remember feeling pretty smart when I was a kid. Maybe that's just how all kids feel but that's what I remember ‚Äì getting better grades than most other kids. During my teenage years I didn't work very hard and still got good grades. I even got accepted into a school that only took on students that got good grades. That's when things started to change. Everyone seemed so much smarter than me and it was really scary. I went from feeling like one of the smartest guys in the room to the dumbest ‚Äì and I'd let myself know just how dumb I was, beating myself up.

Soon, I wasn't just stupid, I was boring. Then I was ugly and weak and pathetic in the eyes of everyone. I felt like I was getting dumber. A brain fog had permeated my mind ‚Äì I couldn't think as fast. My grades slipped as I worked even less and started playing video games more. Gaming takes up your attention and the thoughts more or less stop.

I still managed to get into a decent university but I was ashamed of my accomplishment because all my classmates were moving on to much more prestigious ones. I lasted two and a half years at uni before the suicidal thoughts started to become a real plan. Scared, friendless and far from home, I decided not to go through with it one night ‚Äì the worst night of my life. Instead I called my mom late that night and early the next morning I was on a train home.

Since then, I've been living with my mom. I work as a waiter and the job sees a high staff turnover with a majority of people working there being students trying to earn some money in between their studies. I can feel them judging me when I tell them that it's all I do ‚Äì I'm not doing this part time while I chase my dreams. I don't have anything else going on. I'm a 25yo man living with his mom and working a minimum wage job.

I got help, of course ‚Äì talking to some professionals and taking pills ‚Äì but the thoughts never really left. I know I'm not supposed to indulge them. My therapist told me, *you wouldn't say those things to your best friend so why would you say them to yourself?* I would reply that my best friend isn't trying to sabotage and fuck up my life. But I was never trying to do that and yet I felt like I deserved to hear the the things I was telling myself and deserved the life I now had because of how stupid and pathetic I was.

Recently, after doing something stupid but totally forgivable and human, I googled 'Is it possible to get dumber?' The first result was the question: *Is it psychologically possible to get dumber* on Quora. One of the answers by Norma Pellett:

> My experience tells me yes. I know a woman who was articulate and educated. I moved away and saw her again after ten years. She had no opinions of her own and couldn't articulate a decent sentence.

> I asked other friends if she had been ill or in an accident. No, she hadn't. Then I heard her husband talking to her. He called her ‚Äùstupid‚Äù and told her what she was doing was idiotic. He berated her for several more minutes. She was so cowed by this abuse that she bought into his assessment of her intelligence.

Abuse is a terrible thing and I don't want to diminish it or its victims but I couldn't help but compare the husband to the voice in my head. The abuse I put myself through. I imagine having another person tell you those things is a thousand times worse.

I have always thought that a smart person was smart no matter what. That they may not believe it and people might tell them otherwise but they were, unchangeably, smart. Maybe it's obvious to everyone else but it never occurred to me that people could become the person they were told they are. That their personality could be moulded. What my therapist should have told me is *You wouldn't emotionally abuse another person so why would you emotionally abuse yourself?* Thinking of it that way it's hard to feel like I deserve it. There is not a person in the world that I believe deserves abuse.

So how to stop? It's important not to try telling yourself the opposite of the things you usually tell yourself. I'm not going to look in the mirror every day and tell myself I'm smart, confident, handsome etc. That just feels inauthentic and quite silly. What you have to do instead is learn to recognise the thoughts and externalize them ‚Äì think of them as not your own but rather your anxiety's or your depression's. Your illness is your own personal abuser. Then the next step will be to stop believing the thoughts by not giving them your attention. Don't think the opposite or try to argue with them (e.g. *I'm not ugly I'm beautiful*) instead, try to refocus on whatever it is you were doing. This is hard but can get easier with practice. Mindfulness meditations help. You can even try talking back to the thoughts as though you aren't taking them seriously, *Thanks anxiety, tell me that again! C'mon that's what you always say. Ha, that's a good one. I was hoping you were going to show up.*

I feel so far behind everyone else but I'm going to really try getting better this time.","I think recognising you're not where you want to be, accepting it and deciding to work towards where you want to be is an amazing step. You should be happy with that. What's on your goals list now? Any idea of who you want to become?",363,16,6/27/2019 11:08,c647ep
mentalhealth,I think people who make jokes/say that people need to ‚Äúman up‚Äù or ‚Äúgrow a pair‚Äù or ‚Äúbe a man‚Äù are part of the problem.,"


My friend tried to commit suicide last night. I watched him drive away in his car drunk and he went on the highway/motorway saying he didn‚Äôt care if he died. Tried to stop him but couldn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs not the issue though. 

I had no idea he was suicidal, his family had no idea he was suicidal, his friends had no idea. He‚Äôd kept his mouth shut and let these feelings fester. 

The conversation about male mental health is nowhere near what it needs to be. It is heading in the right direction sure, but at the moment it only seems to be a big deal when someone is on the brink of suicide or having severe depression. 

There is no emphasis on normal day to day life, people telling young boys to man up if they are upset. Saying be a man. This is vile behaviour and forces boys to stuff down their feelings and deal with it through anger since they feel they can‚Äôt talk it through. Even saying it to girls shows them that this is how they should act and that boys should act differently when it comes to feelings. 

In the US four times as many suicides are by males. 9% have daily anxiety or depression. Of those 9% only a quarter found help for it according to the national health survey 2010-13
Source: https://www.apa.org/monitor/2015/12/numbers

In the UK 76% of suicides are carried out by males and 12.5% men are affected by depression. Of the people that seek help through therapy only 36% are men. Then the most shocking stat from the UK, of all the things that kill men under 45, getting hit by a car, murder, heart attacks etc, the leading cause of death is suicide. I am an under 45 male in the UK and to know that the most likely way for me to die statistically is for me to kill myself is shocking and scary. 

Only 15% of men report they would take time off work to focus on mental health. 34% would feel embarrassed or ashamed to do so for a mental health issue compared to the 15% feeling ashamed for a physical injury. 38% would feel that their employer would look down on them for taking time off for a mental health issue compared to the 26% for a physical.

Even among my friends this sort of ‚Äúman up talk‚Äù happens where if a guy gets upset over something deemed trivial he gets told to stop being a girl. I personally am quite sensitive, when I get super angry I tend to tear up. I hate it because it sometimes weakens my argument but it‚Äôs just how I am. When I get angry I tear up. It‚Äôs not a ‚Äúsad cry‚Äù I‚Äôm just angry. 

 I had an argument with a close female friend and she said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm only joking, so stop crying and grow a pair, man up‚Äù. That says my feelings aren‚Äôt allowed because I‚Äôm male, because apparently I‚Äôm not supposed  to feel that way. I should be calm and collected at all times. But all that does is make my squash my feelings away and deal with them some other way. 

That other way can turn into depression and eventually suicide. 

We need to change the mental health conversation so that it‚Äôs not a conversation about men on the brink of suicide. I‚Äôm aware that it isn‚Äôt only aimed there but at the moment to me it feels like not enough is focused on males feeling  like they *can* talk their problems through with people.","In Easter Europe the stats get even crazier - 7x more men commit suicide than women. I'm upset that the conversation is not at the level it needs to be, we need equality, we need to open up a conversation. You're not a ""pussy"", ""weak"", ""gay"" for struggling. You are a human being and have a brain that sometimes fucks up the production of neurotransmitters. If you are a boy or a man who is struggling and keeping it a secret, just know the way forward is to be vocal about it, otherwise we will never get rid of the stigma. No one will think less of you, and if they will they are not worth sticking around.",353,18,6/23/2019 13:52,c44zo9

For the first time in 8(ish) years I'm no longer on anti-depressants!! *uproarious applause* 

They're now totally out of my system and its crazy how different I feel!

The only satisfactory way to describe it is like Ive had tinted glasses and ear plugs in and now they're off!

The be more specific I was on SSRIs. Basically my brain doesn't make enough serotonin and they kept it active in my brain for longer before the chemical found its final destination. 

Coming out of winter and into a more active schedule is really helping and I have high hopes for me and my brain. 

I'm really pleased and i wanted all of you lovely people in internetland to be pleased too!

I'm 31 now, and I started them when I was 23 so this is definitely new ground for me - infact I have a lot of people in my life who have never known me without their affect on me, so it feels kind of like I (and they) will be meeting a new shiney Fred.

mentalhealth,My 9-year-old is madly obsessed with me. Any advice?,"&#x200B;

At first it seemed very cute and sweet, like a ‚ÄúCrush‚Äù sort of thing. Through this past few years it has been escalating to a point where it is creepy and I fear for her mental health and future safety. I‚Äôm telling this story as a way of trying to get some opinions. 

Let‚Äôs call her Cindy, she is a daughter of a cousin of mine who I am not that close to, but we still get along pretty well. I‚Äôm going to share some anecdotes so you all can see what I mean. 

We come from a family where reunions and parties are common and happen at least once a month. So, we all see each other frequently. Cindy always wants to be around me, she wants me to play with her and hold her every minute of every single reunion. Whenever I dare to hug, say hi, or even acknowledge any other member of the family (especially when it comes to younger females of the family) she would get upset and throw a tantrum, running away onto the streets. Whenever the family starts dancing outside (which is pretty often lol) Cindy makes me pick her up and dance with her. I can only dance with her, no other female is allowed near me, I can‚Äôt even put her down to go the bathroom or have a drink. And whenever I did put her down well‚Ä¶ temper tantrum time. 

She once smacked her youngest sister (Mia, 2-year-old) so hard it almost knocked her out, just because she was walking around the house, spotted me, smiled, and wanted to get close to say hi. 

Anytime another female of the family would bring me something to eat or drink, she would make me give it back or throw it away so she could go and bring me whatever I had just been given. 

One time I did not show up to one of those reunions because some other plan that sounded more fun came around (dick move I know). Cindy asked everyone a thousand times where I was, and why I wasn‚Äôt showing up. Eventually they got tired of her and decided to call me, I explained that I was hanging out with some friends. When they told her about this, she got furious, grabbed a stone and threw it at the nearest car, breaking one of the windows. She then locked herself up inside one of the rooms. 

3 or 4 times a week, Cindy‚Äôs mom would call me, telling me Cindy wanted me to come over so I could help her with her homework. Sometimes, her other sister (8-year-old) would ask for my help too, causing Cindy to flip out, throw things at her, and call her names. Whenever I refused the invitation to help Cindy with her hw, she would start ripping her notebooks and textbooks, or pouring water on them. 

She then started to force her parents to bring her to my place every other day, even if it was for a short visit. This One time they left her with me because they needed someone to watch her to do some errands. Cindy was in my room, and I left for a couple of minutes to get her some snacks. When I came back, I found her going thru my clothes. She started crying and said she wanted to steal one of my t-shirts so she could remember me with it. I thought it was kind weird, but cute in a way. I told her she could have one of her choosing. Each time she came over after that she demanded a new shirt to take. I told her I couldn‚Äôt give her anymore shirts because I don‚Äôt have many. (which is true) Every time she would come, we would have the exact same conversation, until, without me noticing, she took pretty much all my shirts and stuffed them inside her backpack. Her mother had to come back the next day and give them back. 

I used to play along and not say much to her or her mother because, like I said, I thought it just was a ‚Äúcrush‚Äù or just a little girl overly attached to an older family member. It escalated gradually to a point which I didn‚Äôt know what to do. And besides, I‚Äôm really not into confrontation, so I didn‚Äôt want to cause any trouble. 

Last time I saw Cindy was this past weekend. (another family reunion) but this time, I brought my new girlfriend with me (she was my best friend for 6 years but I escaped the friendzone haha). Cindy was using crutches because she had gotten injured doing something or other while at school, so she couldn‚Äôt follow me around like she usually does. 

Obviously, she got furious when she met my girlfriend, but she didn‚Äôt say much. She sat right between us and didn‚Äôt let us kiss, hug or dance. Laura (my gf) Went to grab a drink for both of us, and immediately Cindy started moving around so she was occupying the rest of the sofa. When Laura came back, she refused to move and let her sit. I lost my patience (even when I lose my patience, I‚Äôm still pretty chill) and told her that she was being mean to my GF and that meant she was also being mean to me. I also told her we (Me and Laura) would have to leave if she kept it up.

Cindy lost it, she started screaming and kicking, she called Laura every name in the book and finished by saying that if we continued being together, she would shoot us both with his father‚Äôs gun. Turns out my cousin is not very bright, and it took her this long to realize something might be wrong with her daughter. My cousin pulled me aside and I told her everything, everything I just told you and a lot more. I advised her to seek help for Cindy and told her it was best if I stayed away for a while. 

Im really worried about Cindy and her wellbeing. So please, if anyone has gone thru something similar, or if some of you understand what is going on and what can I do to help. I would gladly listen. 

Thank you. Ps. English is not my first language so sorry if some of the writing is gibberish.","Yeah seems like an attachment disorder.

My panic attack started when I had this insane thought ‚Äúwas he out all night boozing around getting frisky/messing with other women?‚Äù. My heart started racing, my mind was running wild, I started to breathe heavier and heavier. I was in this state for about 30 minutes trying to remain calm.

mentalhealth,"""You don't look like you have schizophrenia.""","I don't look like I have schizophrenia, but I stay silent in fear that I will say something inappropriate, or have a word salad fall out of my mouth. You percieve this as shyness.

You may not be able to tell, but under my clothes are strategically placed scars, the blade scores my skin in places you will never see. You percieve the way I dress as modesty.

I don't shower or change for a week on end. And when I leave the house, my significant other often has to tell me I am wearing something inside out or backwards. Sometimes it takes me a couple of tries, and you see only the end result.

I don't seem like I have schizophrenia, but when in mixed company, I will take excessive trips to the bathroom, just for a moment of silence, because things are a bit too loud. You see someone with an over-active bladder. 

I don't seem like I have schizophrenia, because the whole world would fear me if I did. And when I DO act out of character, because my mask has become too heavy, you are shocked. You perceive this as selfishness, toxicity, or childlike. 

I don't look like I have schizophrenia, but, my friend, you are not looking close enough.","Fuck this world... people who don‚Äôt understand mental illnesses are dumb as fuck. 

You definitely don‚Äôt need to tell people what‚Äôs going on w you to make them understand. It‚Äôs none of their business!

mentalhealth,Instagram removed my picture of my manicure because I had visible scars,"I cant contact instagram and I have no where else to share this but I'm livid. I took a picture of my manicure (i've never gotten one before) and in the bottom bit of the picture you could see some scars from self harm I did in the past. But my picture gets fucking REMOVED because it is ""encouraging self harm""

So apparently instagram shames and censors people with scars? Am I not allowed to show my arm in public light? Do I have to fucking hide my arm when I take pictures? It's absolutely disgusting 

I've had this same thing happen in discord servers, where I have my arm in the picture and it's not the focus of the picture AT all and my shit gets deleted. I'm not ashamed of my scars, it's a part of my story and I don't want to hide it nor should I have to hide it. It's ok to have scars and I want others to know that too


Anyways rant over, maybe I'm crazy but I think it's ridiculous and offensive. Anyone else is allowed to show their arm, why can't I? it's not like it's a picture of me right after cutting or like bleeding or anything, they're fucking scars","I've seen pictures of ""makeup"" that are more graphic than actual self harm on Instagram and they haven't been removed.

And this isn't me being worried about what other people think... it's more like a curiosity cause i have no clue who i am and what my personality is but someone like my friends or family might.

My therapist says I have identity issues and I want to get over them and actually know who i am. Anyone else feel the same way or have any suggestions how to fix it?","Going through therapy, it‚Äôs definitely brought about the realization that because I‚Äôm wearing all these masks in an attempt to satisfy everyone, I‚Äôve lost sight on who the real me is.

I‚Äôve started to kind of discover who I am by pursuing something I‚Äôve been curious to try out. My therapist gave me the encouragement to try out a hobby and I‚Äôve been keeping to it every week. Maybe this would be a way to find yourself.",332,30,5/26/2019 16:00,bt9kb9
mentalhealth,"For people with depression, does anybody else feel like their depression is episodic?","For instance, feeling so depressed and negative about everything and anything. 

And then later (or earlier) in the day everything is perfect and amazing.

This is how I almost always feel. And it‚Äôs almost always completely random and doesn‚Äôt pertain to what I‚Äôm doing at the time.

mentalhealth,Anyone else feel like they can't trust their own thoughts and feelings?,"I have a therapist, i'm going to sessions.

It's difficult to talk to her because I never know if my feelings are...real or if i'm just imagining them/being too dramatic about them.

It's so hard to answer questions about ""*and how does that make you feel?""* And ""and what do you think about this thing that happened?"" And ""why do you think that is?"" and ""what do you mean when you say that?"" and ""describe your feelings when...""

I don't know what to say or even think when the therapist asks me these. Every time I answer, clumsily and feeling fake while doing ir, the words sound silly and ..like i'm overreacting. And then...my head starts to doubt itself.

My internal monologue starts diminishing what i've just said THE MINUTE I say it out loud. ""You're being very dramatic"" ""Is this true though?"" ""Are you sure the therapist isn't laughing at you right now? She probably thinks you're undeserving of the help but she wants the money"" ""your mom would say you're being ridiculous right now."" ""Your problems are stupid compared to [x]""

How...do you counter that?","Really, that's one of the reasons they are asking you. Sometimes we have thoughts and feelings and we just ASSUME they are real. We hold onto ideas and thoughts that are ridiculous, take them as gospel, and let them bring us down. We let emotions flood us and just accept them instead of trying to figure out what we're actually feeling and why. It's good that you are questioning yourself. It means you are trying to learn to be honest with yourself, which is hard for a lot of us. We assume we would never lie to ourselves. If I look in the mirror and tell myself I'm fat and worthless, it must be true because I know me better than anyone, right? Not necessarily. 

That other voice that is you, that criticizes and brings you down, it isn't REALLY you. You can acknowledge it, but you don't have to listen to it anymore than anyone else who is being an asshole to you. 

I'll tell you one thing that's really helped me over the years, as far as learning to not take that stuff so seriously. I started a journal when I was a teenager - decades ago - as an outlet for my thoughts and emotions. Eventually I started reading back through past entries. In the moment, things felt so huge and important, and in hindsight, they hardly made any difference at all. We often react to and over-analyze things that don't warrant it, and it's hard to see that except in hindsight. 

The therapist isn't laughing at you or criticizing you, trust me. They've heard it all. Their job is to bring things to the surface and get you to sort of remove yourself from stuff so you aren't just overwhelmed and drowing and lost in your thoughts and emotions, accepting them without question. Doubting yourself is not always a bad thing - it allows you to forge a path to self-improvement. ",326,23,2/28/2019 14:15,avrl8k

mentalhealth,I no longer want to die.,"This time 2 months ago, I was 34 weeks pregnant, with an adoption plan in place to relinquish my baby at birth. After years of suffering heavily with my mental health, I thought I was too fucked up to be able to love a child. No maternal instincts, I couldn‚Äôt even look after myself, how the fuck would I look after a baby?

I thought it‚Äôd be cruel to subject a child to a lifetime with me. That my baby would be better with someone else, I concealed the pregnancy from my entire family, I‚Äôd completely isolated myself from everybody, convinced that I would give birth, give up my baby, and never tell a soul. 

The isolation, spending weeks on end alone in a flat without leaving the house led to a massive decline in my already dire mental health. At 8 months pregnant, an ambulance was called to me at a multi story car park at 3am. I couldn‚Äôt do it, not when there was only a few weeks to go, as much as I wanted to die, I figured I‚Äôd hang on just 4 more weeks until my baby was born, then I‚Äôd do it. 

This led to many services getting involved, social workers, specialist midwives, the crisis team, the home treatment team and even perinatal mental health specialists. I‚Äôm not going to go into detail about the home environment I was in, because it still pains me to this day, but it was heavily infested with rats, only one window to the whole place, but because I was heavily pregnant (suffering with carpal tunnel) and could no longer work (I‚Äôm self employed, no maternity leave/pay.) I was stuck there, In this dungeon, 8 months pregnant stuck in a dark hell hole I couldn‚Äôt go outside due to concealing my pregnancy, listening to rats chewing through the walls around me. I was so ready to die.

Then, my family tried to barge in, convinced that I had fallen into a horrible drug addiction or worse, was rotting away alone, I promised that I would see them the next day and tell them what was happening. They thought this was me being ready to open up, get help, when really it was me giving up. I had nothing left to lose, I planned on being dead soon anyway, and I missed them. During my pregnancy, because of me concealing it i had to miss seeing my mother in hospital after she was rushed in for emergency surgery, my family dog dying (I never got to say goodbye) and, the death of my aunty and her funeral. I figured if I was going to die soon, I wanted to spend my last bit of time with them. I was surrendering, the adoption plan was in place, my baby would have a good life.

My family were supportive, as I knew they would be. Many services presumed my reason for hiding the pregnancy from them was out of fear, but it was the opposite. I‚Äôm lucky to come from a loving wealthy family who I didn‚Äôt want to change my mind. I wanted to die. 

My family begged me not to go through with the adoption, my mother offering to take full custody of my baby if I tried motherhood and didn‚Äôt like it. I wanted them to be happy, I thought he could be my replacement when I was gone, that he‚Äôd keep them busy and take some weight off their grief of losing me. I agreed, my mother got me to move back in with her, and I enjoyed the luxuries of sleeping at night not worrying about rats crawling over me and having access to hot water again. 

12 days after I told my family I was pregnant, my beautiful baby boy was born, 3 weeks early. From the second I first held him, he was my boy, and he wasn‚Äôt going anywhere.

From the moment he was here, it‚Äôs like my mental illness has been an awful boot camp that I‚Äôve finally graduated. Like all my suffering is now worth something. 

As you‚Äôll know, BPD amplified all emotions, I feel everything so intensely my emotions are like a physical sensation. In the past, this has caused me so much pain and heartbreak, until the second I first held my son, and the feeling of maternal love flooded me with the most intense, incredible feeling i could ever imagine. Something I never imagined I could feel, that I thought I was too fucked up to experience, came to me so naturally. And now I have a little human who I can love as much as I want and it doesn‚Äôt aggravate him. I‚Äôm never ‚Äòtoo much‚Äô for him, because he needs me and depends on me fully. How can I possibly be suicidal anymore when I have my baby who will always need me?

All those nights I‚Äôve spent awake all hours in tears, seem like preparation for the sleepless nights of having a newborn (,minus the tears!) 

My baby has become my fixation, and the best part? He wants all of my love, he doesn‚Äôt want space from me. And I‚Äôm never alone anymore. I have somebody to be strong for. Do I still feel like shit sometimes? Absolutely. But I don‚Äôt get the chance to feel like shit for too long, cause my baby keeps me busy! My overthinking myself into depressive episodes? Don‚Äôt have the time anymore, my boy needs me.

I never imagined being a mother, and I never imagined getting better.. which I‚Äôm still not fully. But I‚Äôm the best I‚Äôve been in years, and for the first time in a truly long time, I‚Äôm no longer suicidal. I want to be here, I want to care for my son, make sure he‚Äôs so loved that he‚Äôll never feel unwanted like I have. And with him around, I can‚Äôt imagine feeling unwanted for a long time (until he‚Äôs old enough for me to be embarrassing!)

It‚Äôs like all the love that I‚Äôve had to give finally has a place to go. I‚Äôm so happy. I look at him and I just want to do right by him, to be the best mother I can be. 

2 months ago I was 8 months pregnant, isolated from everybody, in a dark rat infested flat, planning on ending my life.

Now, I‚Äôm currently led on my big comfy double bed, watching my 6 week old baby sleeping peacefully beside me in his Moses basket, in a nice light clean house, smiling to myself and making plans for our future. 

I always rolled my eyes when people told me it gets better. I‚Äôd suffered over a decade of things just getting worse, until this year, I‚Äôd finally hit rock bottom. 

Now I‚Äôm on top of the world. I‚Äôve never been happier than I have being a mother. It‚Äôs been so long since I‚Äôve truly enjoyed being alive. 

This turned into a huge essay, but I don‚Äôt like sharing this too much IRL because of the shame and embarrassment of living in such poor conditions, the state my mental health had got to, and also now that he‚Äôs here... it breaks my heart to think I ever even considered adoption.

I‚Äôve been heavily and closely monitored by many services, and in the 6 weeks since his birth, I‚Äôve been discharged by 4, and have reduced visits from daily to fortnightly/monthly by all of them. They all tell me how amazing I‚Äôm doing at being a mother, and how in their professions it‚Äôs so nice to see a happy ending. I feel like I‚Äôm finally good enough at something, and that‚Äôs being his mummy.

Sorry to go on, I just wanted to share my story and hopefully inspire others that sometimes things do get better. Maybe your turnaround will be nothing like mine, and I‚Äôm not at all suggesting having a baby will cure your mental illness, but for me, this is finally me coming out of the other side. 

I‚Äôm finally happy. At 22 years old and a decade of diagnosed mental health problems, I don‚Äôt want to die anymore.","Congratulations on the new baby! I'm also happy to hear you don't feel like dying anymore. 

Are you following up with a therapist? Even though you're feeling better now, it's not a bad idea to have extra tools with how to cope. Especially since you're responsible for both of you now.

mentalhealth,Why is mental health care so inaccessible?,"Everyone's advice is always, ""talk to a professional"" but nobody will acknowledge how impossible that is. 

I work a full-time job, with benefits. Financially, I'm not rich, but I'm not poor. My insurance supposedly covers mental health services, but I recently made the call for a referral, and I was only given a list of 3 providers. None of them are accepting new patients, and even if they were, I can't find enough info on them online to even know if they will be a good fit for me.

There are a few providers in town that I think I would feel really comfortable with, but they are not covered under my insurance and I cannot afford to pay out of pocket. I make enough that I don't qualify for sliding scale, but not enough to actually pay the full rates.

This is ridiculous to me that, at this point in my life, I am more financially stable than I ever have been and quite frankly, pretty privileged in terms of money. Yet, I cannot get decent mental health care.

Honestly, it scares me and it makes me feel a bit hopeless. I've been going back and forth with even wanting help, and it took a lot for me to finally decide to make that phone call.

&#x200B;

I saw the recent documentary on incels by the BBC, and it was just me staring at what I've become.

&#x200B;

I'm socially maladjusted due to my upbringing, my parents didn't allow me to interact with other kids, so my social skills dwindled ever since. I have a lot of social anxiety, and can barely look people in the eyes. My posture is stiff, I can't smile, I'm paranoid that everyone hates me.

&#x200B;

Because of this, I tried to find a community of others that felt similar to me. I dwelled within incel forums for the past 2-3 years, but I don't want to live this way. I see people on there talking about the most fucked up shit, and I sometimes smiled about it. I don't want to be this way.

&#x200B;

I want help but I don't know what to do. How do I become socially successful and beat social anxiety? I want to be accepted by others, not become a sick person.

Is it even possible for me? I don't have any friends, social-skills, or people to support me.","Hey. I'm proud of you for trying to find a way out. You're doing a good job, because the hardest part is finding the motivation to start.

mentalhealth,"To anyone who was hurt, abused, manipulated or ridiculed by parents/caregivers: it's not your fault and it's not your job to fix them and their shitty problems.","I have come to fully understand something, at 25 years of age - it's not your fault how adults treated you when you were a kid. You literally had not a single ounce of control over their stupidity, selfishness and incapability.

If you were abused, hurt, ripped apart by their words or even physically injured by those so-called grown-ups in your childhood, **it is absolutely and categorically not your fault**. And it is not your job to fix it. It's not your job now and it wasn't your job then. You had no control over their actions and no responsibility for them. They had the responsibility to care for you and they messed it up big time. You did not ask to be born into the situation you were born into. You were a vulnerable child whose needs, for some reason or another, were not fully met. And that rests entirely with the adults, not with you. A child can never be blamed for that. And the child who turns into the adult should not blame themselves for their parents' shortcomings, either.

Also, **you owe them nothing**. They may have fed you and put a roof over your head, but if they otherwise treated you like shit, or still do treat you like shit, walk away and don't look back. Now you're an adult and you have choices and autonomy over your own life. You don't need to be around them if you don't want to, or if it doesn't feel safe and secure.

When someone is posting about their mental health, it takes a lot of courage and mental energy to actually reach out for help. Please stop using these posts to advertise for some random product that is likely not clinically approved as treatment. It is exploitative, predatory and extremely detrimental, and I will actively block and report you.

Sorry about the rant, but someone had to say it. 

UGH.",Agreed. How parasitic is it to exploit people's mental health issues for commercial gain?,309,45,12/8/2019 7:16,e7qtkk
mentalhealth,Last night this sub really helped me. I wanted to say thanks.,Thats it really. Just thankyou. Try to be kind to yourselves today.,And the same to you. I hope you're feeling better today x,307,2,7/4/2019 11:43,c91mcm
mentalhealth,Reminding me my death will hurt people makes it worse,"Constantly being told things like ""think about how it will affect those who love you"" or ""please don't, there are people who love and very much care about you"" produces the exact opposite feeling intended. I don't even feel empathy anymore, if those around me died, I wouldn't feel anything but inconvenienced. 

It's essentially telling me my suffering and pain I feel every second of every day is less important than the emotions of the people around me, and that wanting it all to finally end is ""selfish"". 

It reduces my existence to nothing more than a NPC character on the lives of others, I only exist for their benefit, and everything I feel is necessary to continue experiencing for their benefit. Fuck this, Fuck them, Fuck it all. I want to do something selfish for once, and not have to worry about how everyone else feels for once.

I shouldn't have to keep living just for them.","When I was first diagnosed with bipolar in my early 20s and being somewhat self-destructive, my mother would scream at me ""You're going to put your little sister in therapy!"" To which I would think, ""Who was looking out for *me* before I landed in therapy? Never out loud, though, that would have been ""fresh"".

I feel you, OP. I hate hearing people who take their own lives being called selfish. When I want to walk into traffic, being told I'll hurt other people just makes me feel guilty, which adds to my own pain, which nobody seems to give a damn about.",302,25,11/10/2019 17:00,dudyww
mentalhealth,does anyone else do this?,does anyone else plop into bed almost as soon as they get home from work or outside every day and then just stay in bed until it‚Äôs time to sleep? ,"Yes, I do this as well. It‚Äôs gotten extremely bad over the past few months. It went from staying in bed on my days off to days now where I wake up only to care for my dogs, carry my pillow to the couch and sleep as much as possible. ",299,44,2/15/2019 22:04,ar1vn9
mentalhealth,People who say that mental illness isn‚Äôt real or you shouldn‚Äôt take pills for it because it doesn‚Äôt show on the outside are literally wrong.,"When I‚Äôm depressed I look like shit, smell like shit, stay in bed all day and sleep all day. I isolate myself and when I‚Äôm really bad I genuinly want to die. If you were to take a brain scan of me when I‚Äôm at my worst - it would show significant reduction in serotonin and dopamine levels e.g. I hate all this stigma and predjudice around my disease. Fuck all these people. They don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre talking about at all. You wouldn‚Äôt tell a cancer patient who doesn‚Äôt look like he has cancer to stop his chemo just because he looks like he‚Äôs fine. Why would you tell that to me when I tell you I‚Äôm on antidepressants? If I hadn‚Äôt been taking them every day these last couple of months - I would be dead. People need to educate themselves better on our illness. Please upvote and share so we can get the word around. I‚Äôm pissed. ","This is so relatable. Even when the social stigma is gone, it‚Äôs still so hard for people to understand how symptoms of dopamine/serotonin insufficiency affect your day to day life. 

My fianc√© is a PhD in neuroscience, and even though he doesn‚Äôt study mental illness, he definitely has more background knowledge and expertise than the average Joe. When I‚Äôm at my worst - can‚Äôt get out of bed, can‚Äôt eat, leave the house, etc.,  it‚Äôs super hard for him to understand, and a lot of times he will say things like ‚Äúif you just got up and did something, you‚Äôd feel better,‚Äù or ‚Äúit just seems like you‚Äôre not really trying.‚Äù  He understands it all physiologically, and makes sure I‚Äôm being consistent pharmacologically, but when it comes to the clinical part, he‚Äôs just so clueless, and sometimes it feels personal, though I know it‚Äôs not.

Anyways. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through this. I remember when I was trying to get relatively stable and it was absolutely miserable.  Remember to reach out to people or communities who are knowledgeable and understanding when you feel especially alone. My inbox is always open :)",299,6,1/4/2019 18:27,acl02k
mentalhealth,"The days you don‚Äôt feel like going to therapy, are the days you should go the most.","I‚Äôve noticed this. Every time I have wanted to stay home is when I needed therapy the most; and when I do go the therapy session it ends up being the most helpful since I get all the advice & info I needed. 


Tomorrow I have therapy and right now I don‚Äôt feel like going, but it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm so unhappy that I don‚Äôt even want to talk about it, but I still put my alarm to wake my ass up and go because I need it.


It‚Äôs like feeling sick so you don‚Äôt want to get up and go to the doctor because your symptoms make it really hard for you to move around, but in the end you have to go because it is the only way to get better.","I‚Äôm the same way, I have group therapy weekly and one and one therapy bi-weekly. I usually don‚Äôt want to go",300,10,10/18/2019 3:42,djhsg0
mentalhealth,Is it ok to cut my mother out of my life for my own mental health?,"There‚Äôs a lot to go into and a lot to unpack about my relationship with my mother but the ultimate problem is that her behavior causes me so much anger, pain, and anxiety that I just don‚Äôt want to even think about her, let alone see her. I have been grappling with the realization that she‚Äôs been emotionally abusing me my whole life and her behavior seems to be getting more and more out of control. I‚Äôm moving to the UK with my husband so there will definitely be less physical meetings but I feel guilty about making the decision to leave her out of my life entirely. I‚Äôm actually at a point where I‚Äôm ready to tell her that when my child is born he/she won‚Äôt be allowed to be alone with her.

EDIT: Thank you all so very much for your kind words and encouragement. My husband and I agree that we will limit our interactions with my mother and don‚Äôt want to estrange ourselves from the family that does love and support us. I hope she comes around some day and listens rather than shut down. 

I am overwhelmed by the support I found today.","*Takes deep breath. 

Hells yes.",297,79,8/14/2019 18:06,cqdf4l
mentalhealth,Mental Disorder,"""The worst thing about having a mental illness is people expect you to behave as if you don't.""

This is from the Joker movie. I'd have never expected I'd find something so poignant that explains perfectly how it  feels to deal with the stress of being neurologically different, within a comic book movie. This is exactly how they make us feel. I'm so tired of feeling guilty for being different, for being me. 

Did anyone else see the trailer? Thought I'd drop this tid bit off for those struggling to articulate their feelings.","I'm so excited for it. I loved the way his posture changed through the trailer. I really felt for him when he was climbing the stairs. Need no words for it, I could see it in how he carried himself. 

Another couple of movies that I think are poignant in terms of mental health are Elizabeth Blue and You Were Never Really There ",295,18,4/4/2019 3:30,b97pud
mentalhealth,"For anyone else alone on Thanksgiving remember it‚Äôs just another day, and it will pass.","Like many people out there I‚Äôll be alone this holiday. It makes me sad but it‚Äôs partially intentional. I just want others to know you are not the only person in the world that will be by themselves tomorrow, and to make it a reason to have a self care day and take care of yourself in the best way. Remember it‚Äôs just another day and it will pass.",This is so kind. ‚ù§ I hope you have a great day tomorrow,293,18,11/27/2019 18:11,e2k1na
