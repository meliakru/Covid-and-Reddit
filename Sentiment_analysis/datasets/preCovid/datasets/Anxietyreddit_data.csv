Anxiety,"Professor here, if you have missed class, please come back. We aren‚Äôt mad at you.","Hello, I‚Äôve read a lot of posts recently about folks missing classes and feeling too anxious to come back. Don‚Äôt worry. We would much rather you come back to our classes than continue to miss. We teach because we care about you individually. We care about what‚Äôs going on in your lives. I know it‚Äôs easy to see professors as these omnipresent overlords but know that we are human and we have definitely been in your position before. Please feel better and know that you are always welcome back into class. Just shoot us an email and let us know what‚Äôs up so we can help you make up the work you missed.
","Just as an ironic heads-up, I stay up at night worrying about my students who miss class and lose contact. Oh, anxiety, you troublesome bitch!

Anxiety,"Most people are accepting of you having an anxiety disorder, but an unfortunate amount of people expect you to only have symptoms in private.","A stigma that I‚Äôve noticed in the mental health community... so many people are happy to talk about it and embrace your differences, but oh no.. don‚Äôt have a panic attack in front of them, don‚Äôt seek re-assurance from today‚Äôs anxious thoughts and jitters. 

This is something that needs changing. It is more than ok for someone with diabetes to be comforted even when their their blood sugar gets too low and it affects their work. Even if the circumstances of the blip in their health was due to poor diet or a rough week (I had a co-worker that had this happen at work) but when I struggled with low mood I was told ‚Äòwe all have days like that‚Äô ... ‚Äòdon‚Äôt let customers see you unhappy or uncomfortable‚Äô 

This is an issue with how subjective everyday anxiety and a chronic mental health issue is, if someone does not understand the effort it takes to behave normally they will default to judging you based on how they deal with it. 

Of course it‚Äôs not all bad, I‚Äôm lucky to have family and a handful of friends that have seen me go though treatments and recovery so know the full spectrum of my issues and do not judge or baby me. 

I felt like sharing this little rant to hear your thoughts on if you‚Äôve been accepted or told to ‚Äòhide‚Äô symptoms from the public to spare THEIR discomfort... like your doing it on purpose. ","Has happened a few times, when after a few weeks with reoccurring panic attacks at work, I got told by my boss, who himself has struggled with it, that ‚Äúsometimes we need to leave our troubles at home‚Äù. Kinda bugged me since I tried my best and forced myself to be in a situation where 80% of the time I‚Äôd have a panic attack which led to the point where I couldn‚Äôt even leave the house. Not something you need to hear really. I also often feel guilty when I‚Äôm getting anxious and try to tell someone about it cause I‚Äôm genuinely scared. 

So I‚Äôve kinda started to to act calm in those situations and stay away from people when I can‚Äôt. There‚Äôs a weird uncomfortableness with anxiety, so like you said, people want to be open and show that they care, but it‚Äôs more on paper. But it could also be that if they‚Äôre not used to it they get a bit freaked out cause they don‚Äôt know how to handle it. I often forget to tell people how to deal with panic attacks, or what works for me, even if I‚Äôm close to them. Which could lead to people being more comfortable in those situations.

Anxiety,"after almost canceling an interview today due to anxiety, I forced myself to go, went in there, and killed it!!!!!","I was SO nervous all last night and all day today about this interview. Interviews are a MAJOR trigger for me, I almost always have an anxiety attack in the middle of them, and I‚Äôm really not very good at them. On top of that, it was for a bilingual role and I knew I‚Äôd have to speak German and I was so insecure about my fluency and so freaking anxious that I would totally bomb and embarrass myself. 

I was SO close to canceling. I made a million excuses to my friends in family about why I didn‚Äôt really want the job anyway so I might as well not go. I am so, so glad I didn‚Äôt. 

I experienced a bit of anxiety, but no attacks! I wasn‚Äôt stammering and awkward like I usually am and I was really confident in all of my answers. Best of all, when they brought in the German dude so I could converse with him, he said it was really good and my pronunciation was great, and after he left they all said he‚Äôs Never been impressed by anyone‚Äôs German before!!!

I never feel good or confident after leaving an interview, but this time I do. I Really Really Really hope I get the job (the office is UNREAL, benefits are wild, free breakfast and lunch, everyone was super laid back, better pay) but even if I don‚Äôt, I‚Äôm just so damn proud of myself for forcing myself to go instead of bailing like I always do.

Just had to share because I feel super happy right now. :) wish me luck!

Yep, normal and goes hand in hand with all these sensations when we're too aware of them. 100% of the sensations you're feeling and going through are normal in every day life, We're just unfortunately hyper aware of them. We feel a pain or uncomfortable sensation and our minds immediately go to the worst possible scenario, death, but that won't be the outcome.

Anxiety,"This time last year I couldn‚Äôt leave my bedroom because of anxiety, today I talked myself down from a panic attack during a surgical procedure.","I‚Äôm a 22 year old guy and my anxiety was horrible a year ago. I was unemployed, my life ruled by anxiety. I couldn‚Äôt drive, go out with friends, see a movie, and for a while didn‚Äôt leave my room. It got so bad I was severely underweight and stayed in a psych hospital for a few days. I began to see a therapist who did CBT 3 times a week, plus saw a psychiatrist and got on the right medication. 

Now I work in a big hospital operating room as a technician full time, I drive all the time, go on dates, and I start school to be an EMT Monday. Today I was assisting during a gastric bypass. I was fully scrubbed in, holding a camera where I have to be dead still, and it‚Äôs just me and the 2 doctors, all crammed around this patient. It wasn‚Äôt the first time I assisted during this surgery, but it was my first time with this doctor, who‚Äôs notoriously vicious, and at one point shit started to hit the fan. The room got silent, tensions where high, and my anxiety skyrocketed. My mask started to fog up and I was sweating, but I can‚Äôt touch my face and contaminate my gloves, so I was literally trapped. Then I remembered everything I had learned, I started to focus on my breathing and the work the doctor was doing. I thought to myself encouraging thoughts, and within a minute my anxiety dropped back down, and we ended up completing the surgery. The best part? The doctor told me I did a great job, something even the nurses had rarely ever heard him say to someone. 

The point of this post? To look at where I was a year ago, basically bedridden from anxiety. Now I live a very full life and do things that I want to, not that my anxiety lets me do. You CAN improve and get your life back. If I did it, any of you can do it. The biggest advice I can give is please, get help. I was terrified but it saved my life. I still go to therapy once a month, and I‚Äôm still on my medications, and there is absolutely no shame in that. 

I hope this post maybe inspired even one of you. Dealing with anxiety has been the hardest thing I‚Äôve ever done, and I failed at times but didn‚Äôt stop trying. No one has to live like this, and no one has to do it alone. I wish everyone here the absolute best of luck conquering your inner demons, and I believe in you.

Anxiety,Having a long term anxiety disorder is being happy and confident for more than 2 days and then considering if it‚Äôs mania because it‚Äôs so unusual.,"Honestly this happened to me, if you read my posts you‚Äôll know I‚Äôm mostly recovered from having panic attacks and worrying about everything (6 months without a major panic attack woohoo!) I‚Äôve come a long way with keeping on top of my diet, exercising regularly and forcing myself to be social with family and friends. 

But I‚Äôve been crazy happy the last couple of days due to finally quitting a job that made me miserable. Feeling confident and happy to be social and chat more to friends. I‚Äôm not used to feeling anymore than content for a few hours so to feel ecstatic for a few days made me feel like I was going crazy haha. 

It goes to show I‚Äôm not used to any emotions in their extremes, including happiness.  I feel like true comfort is being in a ‚Äòmeh‚Äô mood. 

After talking to a therapist in the past about this it‚Äôs actually very common, chronic anxiety disorders basically put all your energy into coping with one extreme emotion and when you recover it sometimes unveils a tendency to feel very uncomfortable with emotions you did not previously express... like anger, confidence, and happiness. And was actually a trigger for one of my relapses... I was convinced I was an aggressive person that was dangerous because in around 10 years of my youth i did not express anger, not because it was repressed, but because anxiety was my default reaction to everything! I‚Äôm not an angry person.. and after a lot of CBT I‚Äôve come to accept all emotions that make us unique and often very confused people! I‚Äôm allowed to be happy. I‚Äôm allowed to be angry... and anxiety is ok in small doses too. ","It sounds like you have really sorted your life out. Well done, that's awesome. ",1300,27,2/3/2019 16:16,amqy1o

This thought process basically paralyzes me in my chair, and I end up scrolling through Reddit for hours instead of doing things I actually want to do. 

In the meantime my husband will be right next to me at his desk happily playing video games without a care in the world. I really envy him sometimes for being able to come home, sit down, and just *do whatever the fuck he wants.* It kills me when I accomplish absolutely nothing in a day. It leaves me with no goals, no enjoyement, and is just slowly killing me. This bizarre fear of wasting time just results in wasted time.",1218,54,11/8/2019 9:27,dtd0fi
Anxiety,I just got fired on my first day and I don't know what to do,"I have an anxiety disorder and often get panic attacks. I just got fired from my new job as a cashier in a supermarket. Sitting in the toilet room of a big shopping centre crying as I am typing this. This was my first real job since I finished school in may last year. So today was my first day and it all started really bad. Every bread and vegetable has its own number which I have to type into the cash register. I don't know any of them so I have to look everything up on a piece of paper. That takes a while and I'm not really comfortable with that cash register as I never used something like that before. It took me quite some time to get through each customer and I often had to call another worker to come help me. The line at my register got bigger and bigger. We have 3 cashiers but for some reason all the customers were in my line and my coworkers didn't really care. Then there was that older gentleman, I accidentaly typed in the wrong number for his bread, I apologized and called for a coworker. The man got really annoyed and started to yell at me, I didn't know what to do. The other customers just stared angrily at me and started to express how slow I am. At that point I was close to crying and I got a panic attack. Finally my boss came and explained he doesn't want me here and that I need to pack my stuff and leave. So yea, I don't know what to do, my parents are going to kill me. I'm lost, I can't even have a normal job for a day. 

I hope this is readable as english isn't my first language and I'm still pretty nervous about everything.

Anxiety,Does anyone else keep thinking about and over-analyzing humiliating events from 10+ years ago?,"I recently had a (sort of sudden) realization that everyone would make fun of me in High School, with me being the joke and the only one not knowing what was going on (even the teacher was in on it...). These moments were ongoing and humiliating - I would almost always play into the joke too. 

I never thought I was popular, but I never realized how big of a loser I was during those years. All of the people who pretended to be my friend were actually making fun of me. I graduated high school over 10 years ago and have become a self-supporting adult now, but still struggle with self esteem. Nonetheless, I'm not sure why this suddenly bothers me. Since HS, I had a pretty successful time in college and am doing well in my career, but still keep going back to these HS thoughts. Has anyone else had this happen, or have any advice?","Absolutely.

Anxiety,It took me years to realize my anxiety was anxiety and not just my personality.,"I only came to this realization recently and it's weird that it took so long when anxiety runs in my family. My mom's been hospitalized for panic attacks. I've had depressive bouts but every time I heard someone mention anxiety, my brain was like ""hmmm. Not me."" 

&#x200B;

I though being awkward, nervous, on-edge, and uncomfortable 24/7 was just my personality. I thought my fear of talking to other people and my fear of making phone calls (often to the point of tears) was just me being shy. I thought constant chest tightness and pain was just normal stress. I thought it was normal for the smallest things to be beyond overwhelming. My intense fears of constantly fucking up had been with me for so long that I never thought twice about the rationale behind it. I have ADHD as well and when I thought maybe that was the cause of some of it, but when I got my adderall prescription, I wasn't magically cured of all my uncomfortableness. I was still a nervous, anxious person who also happened to be able to focus better than I used to.

&#x200B;

Two weeks ago, the feelings became stronger than normal. I had aches in my chest for days on end. I was so nervous and on edge--more so than usual. That happened out of nowhere, then an unexpected loss in the family sent me over the edge in terms of panicking. It dawned on me after the worst had passed that maybe this is an anxiety disorder. I did a lot of self-reflecting and realized maybe I've been anxious all my life and I Just never realized it because I thought it was normal.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I don't really know what the point of me typing all this out is, but it just feels good to know maybe there's hope for me. I talked to my doctor and was prescribed zoloft last Friday. I don't know how much it will change me, I know that it's not some kind of magic pill, but just knowing that I'm not alone and that there's a chance to overcome this is so comforting to me.

Anxiety,Does anyone else get stomach pains and diarrhea with their anxiety?,"My anxiety is partly linked to my extreme emetophobia (fear of vomiting) and for those of you who don't know about it, it ruins every aspect of my life, to the point where if I get the slightest stomach pain or uncomfortable feeling ill panic, which results in me having stomach pains all the time, and sometimes, maybe once a month or so I'll come across feeling awful, with crippling stomach pains and end up on the toilet for half an hour with poop coming out like a faucet, does anyone else experience diarrhea along with their anxiety?

I‚Äôve been making myself physically sick the past week over going to a bridal shower on the weekend.

I‚Äôve even been in group therapy (iOP) for weeks to try and find ways to lessen my anxiety, but I just feel  like I took a step back.

Anxiety,"Things that helped me manage my anxiety, maybe this can help you too","I am taking Lexapro and doing therapy, but I also made a lot of lifestyle changes have made a huge difference, so I wanted to share my list. 

1. I went completely caffeine free. It's been about a month. I also was having headaches and issues with my blood pressure, both of which are better. I didn't think I'd be able to do this (was having 3 to 4 cups of strong coffee and 1-2 sodas per day) but I feel so much better off it. I drink a lot of decaf tea and water. The first week was rough (headaches!) but I powered through and stuck with it. 

2. I stopped going on Facebook altogether. The whole ""comparison"" crap and drama, don't need it.

3. I don't watch the TV news. Ever.

4. I am not overweight, but I started exercising. My therapist told me this is a great treatment for anxiety and he was right. I just do power walk videos on You Tube, nothing fancy.

5. I eat breakfast every day now (was not doing this before) and started eating more fruits and vegetables.

6. My therapist told me to do more things that I enjoy. So with all the time I have since I'm not on Facebook so much, I am reading books. Light fiction, nothing that stresses me out. I also have been trying to do some of those adult coloring books, but sometimes I get anxious about what colors to use or if my picture will looks good (ridiculous, I know), so that's a process.

7. I have the Headspace app and do some mindfulness. This is really challenging for someone with anxiety I think. Sometimes you don't want to be inside your head too much. But I have found the Managing Anxiety series to be really helpful, with the noting strategies and just acknowledging the anxious thoughts without judging them or trying to run away from them.

8. My therapist also told me to do things that build confidence. So I try to focus on things I'm good at, because baking a delicious cake or doing a good job at my work does help me feel better about myself.

9. I can't say enough good things about therapy and my counselor. This is the first time in my life (I'm 40) that I have taken this step and it is incredibly helpful. If you're struggling with anxiety, think about it. I started with my employer's EAP (employee assistance program) which offered 3 free sessions, and then moved on to a ""real"" counselor because it was so helpful. Look into if your work has this as an option, it's free! 


Recognize that anxiety management is a process, and not just a switch we can turn off. My instinct previously was to try to run away from it. I hated it and I was mad at it. But now I understand that it's part of who I am, I have to accept that and I have to learn how to manage it. Hang in there, friends. You got this.

    After being house bound for 3 1/2  years I wasn‚Äôt able to walk to the mailbox without having a panic attack. I was so depressed and defeated I didn‚Äôt see the point in even existing anymore. I felt I had nothing to offer this world so in what literally felt like a life and death decision I reached out for help. I called my local  NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness) chapter and tearfully admitted the hell I had been going through.  It felt so liberating just to hear my voice letting some of that pain out. After a half hour or so on the phone, the women kindly suggested I start talking to a therapist via video chat. I did some research and decided on a company called betterhelp. I was assigned a counselor and she helped me to come around to the idea of medication. I then began video chat sessions with a psychiatrist with a company Teladoc. I was prescribed 15 mg (after a gradual increase) of lexapro.  My wife of coarse had to pick up the called in script from the pharmacy. The first two months were not good to say the least, I had a lot of side effects but I pushed through and by the third month i started feeling a little bit of my confidence returning.  I would take little walks a couple hundred feet from the house.  I started to white knuckle drive around the block.  In May of this year at 5 months of medication, on a Saturday morning something in me clicked.  I just said fuck it, jumped in my car and drove a couple miles down the road through multiple stoplights to a Home Depot, went inside and made a purchase. It was TERRIFYING!  I was a nervous wreck but by the time I made it home I was so stinkin proud of myself I was gitty. I came right on here to reddit and announced my crowning achievement. 
     In the time since then I push myself everyday. Little by little expanding my comfort zone.  I now can drive anywhere in the city, I have even taken the freeway to the next city over. I go for walks with my family to the park. I have gone out to dinners and reconnected with some old friends. Most importantly the quality time out of the house with my children has returned me a mindset that I do have value, and I do have something to offer this world.  I still have down days but overall I am happy and proud of the progress I have made.   
    For me the combination of medication and cognitive behavioral therapy has proven to loosen the chains of anxiety but none of this would have been possible without taking that very first step of many first steps,    Asking for help!   From the bottom of my heart I wish all of you the best.","This is incredible! It's great that you've been able to rebuild your life after your breakdown. Something similar happened to me, so I know how brutally difficult it can be to do that. Thanks for sharing this here - it will inspire a lot of people.",1107,59,11/19/2019 5:10,dyfwbm

Anxiety,Have you guys been crippled by your anxiety so much that you just don't do your assignments?,"Hi,

This is me. Worrying about my assignments just makes me stay still and not do anything.

Not doing anything leads to even more anxiety and more anxiety cripples me from doing anything. Its like a shitty negative feedback loop. 


As a result Im actually failing this unit lol. Every assignment has been handed late due to cripplying anxiety. 

I even got a fucking extension and I am way past THAT due date as well.

Anxiety,Anyone else have to basically be dead to call off of work and not feel guilty?,"My stomach is an absolute mess, i can barely move without running to the toilet. But telling my boss I can't come in makes me crazy anxious, worrying they'll think I'm slacking or something. So then I put it off until I have to leave and just end up showing up and being miserable and unproductive all day. Anyone have issues calling off?","My husband is like this. I think the only reason why he can actually ask off now is because I encourage him about it. I know how hard it is for him to do so, but when he needs to, I am very supportive and it makes it easier for him. 

However, you can coach yourself instead of needing someone else to. Try to look at it objectively or as if it's someone else. Your partner, friend, parent-- they are sick and ask you if they should take off work? What do you say to them? 

You could even do a pros/cons list. Though certain items on the list should weigh heavier: your physical and mental well-being.",1087,63,9/5/2019 15:47,d02jdo

Anxiety,Does anyone else obsess over every little thing they say to people?,"Pretty much every social interaction I have with someone, no matter how small, I spend a ridiculous amount of time afterwards playing back what I said over and over again in my head.

Sometimes I get anxiety about things I said to people in 6th grade.

Edit: so I‚Äôm reading a lot of comments saying they suffer the same thing. Obsessive thinking like this is a common symptom of other things that aren‚Äôt anxiety. Like bipolar disorder and OCD. This is a reminder to make sure you are properly diagnosed. 

I was misdiagnosed for years until I was properly put on the right medication and these thoughts went away. Talk to your doctor because obsessing over thoughts from years ago isn‚Äôt a common thing in anxiety disorder. Please talk to your doctor.",1071,67,7/15/2019 20:25,cdmy2t

Anxiety,I skipped work today due to my anxiety and now I'm so disappointed with myself. Anyone else ever done the same thing?,"My job makes me pretty depressed.

My boss has been away for over a month and I was basically left to my own devices, which was great. He returned today.

Yesterday and last night, I was so worried that I would get depressed that it turned into anxiety. Then I began worrying that I hadn't done enough while he was away that it created even more anxiety. 

I woke up drenched in a cold sweat this morning and called in sick. Now I'm anxious that they'll be pissed off that I wasn't at work yesterday. 

It's a vicious circle and I'm ashamed of myself for running away from my problems.

Anyone else ever done something similar?","You know, sometimes it‚Äôs necessary to take care of our selves. Having anxiety is no different from calling in with the flu. Don‚Äôt feel bad. Take care of yourself. Best wishes.",1062,99,8/18/2019 17:24,cs4469

That voice in my head is searching for something to worry about, almost as though if I don't worry about something, bad things will happen. Like I NEED to be worrying about something.

Anxiety,The list I keep on my phone to help me calm down during high stress and anxiety,"Not sure it will help anyone else but here is a list of stuff I keep on my phone to help me calm down during moments of high stress and anxiety.  I have been slowly adding to this list over the past 4 years when I first started experiencing daily panic attacks and now I find myself rarely referring to it. Hope it helps someone else!

&#x200B;

**Note to Self**

* Give it 20 minutes.
* When you have a negative thought, replace it with a positive one or make up a positive one and fake it til you make it.
* The more I say ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù, the better I feel.
* It‚Äôs just your thoughts.
* I don't know what's going to happen in the future but I know everything is going to be okay.
* You got this. You know you're competent enough so that you won't fail in life.
* What‚Äôs the worst that can happen if you fail? Nothing.
* Look at the grand scheme of things. Don‚Äôt focus so much in the moment. There will be a tomorrow.
* You don‚Äôt have to do anything.
* It‚Äôs not what I have to do. It‚Äôs what I want to do.
* If you feel doomed, that‚Äôs because that‚Äôs what anxiety tends to do. It escalates a situation that, in reality, isn‚Äôt going anywhere.
* Don‚Äôt be afraid of your anxiety.
* You are the play, and the world is your audience.
* You shouldn‚Äôt be scared. Treat the event or activity as a challenge or opportunity.
* Why do you feel like you have to do anything? You don‚Äôt have to do anything.
* The best thing to do is not think about it.
* Staying in the situation will teach your body that everything is ok and there‚Äôs nothing to worry about.

(I know some things on this list repeat but I left them there for reinforcement)

&#x200B;

**4-7-8 Breathing Technique**

* First, let your lips part. Make a whooshing sound, exhaling completely through your mouth.
* Next, close your lips, inhaling silently through your nose as you count to four in your head.
* Then, for seven seconds, hold your breath.
* Make another whooshing exhale from your mouth for eight seconds.
* Repeat.

&#x200B;

**AWARE Calming Technique**

* Accept¬†the anxiety. Don‚Äôt try to fight it, because it will not take away the anxiety.
* Watch¬†the anxiety. Tell yourself which changes in your body and perception you notice and try to look at yourself as if you are an observer of yourself.
* Act¬†normal. Breath normal and remain calm. Don‚Äôt try to escape because that will make you experience your symptoms even more intense. Instead, stay in the situation and experience the anxiety fading away.
* Repeat¬†the steps 1, 2 and 3. If the anxiety is not reduced to an acceptable level yet, then repeat the steps. You‚Äôll see that you‚Äôll calm down soon.
* Expect¬†the best. Practice makes perfect, so practice a lot. Don‚Äôt focus on what may happen to you, because that chance is really small.

&#x200B;

**Other**

* As cliched as it sounds, I really recommend trying to live one day at a time. You're overwhelming yourself by trying to do too much/fix too much/make too many decisions at once. Try to breath, enjoy each day as it comes, and give yourself small goals to get back on track.

I just found out I owe more than I thought to the IRS which means I can‚Äôt afford to leave my toxic living situation, I can‚Äôt afford to see my sick father for the holidays because my new job won‚Äôt allow me to have vacation time as a seasonal employee. I have 3 different major assignments coming up that are nowhere near finished. Sometimes I wish I could hit the pause button on life to catch my breath and sort my thoughts. Staying up late is as close as it gets. The rest of the world is asleep and I can think in peace. As soon as I go to sleep, I‚Äôll wake up and it will be time to move through the motions again and scramble to pull myself together. Yes, this is a rant but the question is not rhetorical.

I know how it is, we all do, and I want you all to know I'm proud of you, you woke up today and you faced anxiety head on, you did a thing, be it small or big you tackled today's tasks and you didn't crumble under anxiety.

- unclench your jaw (important one - thank you u/SaltedBiscuitTV)
- relax your muscles and let your body feel its own weight
- wherever you are, imagine that your scenario is imaginary; you are alone and all noise or people are a sort of movie playing around you
- close your eyes (really, just do it)
- imagine you are in your safest place on earth (your bedroom, an island, near the sea...) -- you should do this as a sort of meditation technique, be careful with dissociation symptoms (I suffer from it but it helps to remove myself from the place I am so you do you!) - thanks to u/veraamber
- inhale deeply and hold it for a couple seconds
- exhale as slow as possible...
- repeat 5 or 10 times
- remember that right at this moment there are thousands of people feeling the same exact thing you are now feeling; you are NOT alone, think about it and feel that connection

Later:
- go on about your day and put the phone down when you can and if possible do something nice that calms you down later - you deserve it! Go for an icecream, snuggle in a nice blanket... 

- if you‚Äôre not alone let people know you need a break to feel better, it‚Äôs a great first step if you are ashamed of your anxiety or try to hide it

- when you have time, write down in a really small font size a list of things that make you feel calmer or relaxed (reading, music, whatever) - print it and put it in your wallet or anything you carry around because most of the time we just forget to do those things! 

When you feel overwhelmed, read the list and choose an item and DO it. It‚Äôs easy for us to fall in the trap of ‚Äúfreezing‚Äù and never do the things that we *know* calm us down. I have mine with a list of good things in life/things I enjoy doing/reminders that I‚Äôve struggled for years and... I‚Äôm still here!

Have a good morning/afternoon/night, you are NEVER alone <3

EDIT #1: added one more step thanks to u/SaltedBiscuitTV
EDIT #2: thanks to u/veraamber for the reminder on ""imagining you're elsewhere"" might be harmful to some people
EDIT #3: as I am still in a very agitated mood and my legs are sore from all the stress I just realized... first silver thingy on here x2! It feels amazing that venting while I was having a hard time helped someone out - Thank you! :')

Anxiety,Does everyone else's anxiety feel more intense at night?,"I swear that from the moment I wake up until dusk I feel good (to the point I don't feel anxious anymore) but when it's dark outside, even when I'm home with my family, my anxiety becomes more intense.","Same here. I feel like it's just being alone with your thoughts, or feeling more alone that does it for me.

I am used to living an unpleasant life, bearing problems all the day and feeling nervous at night and deeply unhappy. However, now I COULD live the perfect life, but I keep asking myself why is everything fine, what's going to happen, if I have any disease, what terrifying destiny is going to punch me in the face. Because of this, my hypochondria is getting worse, I sometimes am convinced that it's not possible for me not to have problems in life, so I must have some deadly disease and every signal my body give to me makes me want to run to the doctor... Sometimes I can't sleep at night because I fear that my house will burn while I sleep, or that some thief will break into my home to steal something (even though we don't own anything valuable!) and doing bad to my family... Have you ever felt that way or am I just an idiot to feel even more anxious because I literally have NOTHING to worry about?","Absolutely, yes. I suspect it's because my brain is scanning for threats (evolution) and finding none feels . . . foreign / incorrect / unlikely.

Anxiety,I drowned my baby sister in my mom's birthday,"First of all, excuse my English.

This happened almost 8 years ago, I was 8 and she was about 4.

It was my mothers birthday and we were going to have dinner with all the family (like we always do), adults were outside the house preparing everything, I was on the second floor of the house, with my little sister.

She started crying, it was her baths time but all adults were busy, so I went to the bath and prepared the bathtub, when everything was ready I put her at the bathtub, with champoo and that kind of stuff. I left her alone there and I went to the first floor to watch TV.

When adults came back they asked for my sister, I told them that she was upstairs, having a bath, they seemed worried and they went to the bath, I followed them, I didn't understand the situation.

When we entered the bathroom she had drowned, they took her out of the bathtub and she was almost blue and really cold. Everybody got really nervous, they called 911 and stuff.

So, basically I killed her.

The relation with my family has never been the same. I am still in therapy for it, I have tried to kill myself time ago. In addition I was adopted so I spent months thinking that my family was going to ""give me back.""

My mother has told me several times that it wasn't my fault, but things will never be alright, I know that she is still disgusted of me.

I will never stop feeling guilty, I am really sorry. There is nothing I can do to feel better.",[deleted],973,69,6/13/2019 13:44,c05zqf

Like you can‚Äôt think straight but you can still function?,Like does anyone else get the feeling that their head is inflated and pressury and you feel like you can‚Äôt think but you can still function just fine? Just wondering if this is just a me thing or not.,"I almost always have a brain fog. I would describe it as white noise. It seems like my brain is busy thinking about a lot of things, but I‚Äôm not connected to what it‚Äôs thinking about, so if someone asks me what I‚Äôm thinking about I truly have no idea. I can still function pretty well in day to day life, but it makes socializing very difficult.  It also sometimes feels like my brain is operating at about 5%; like a computer that tries to boot up but the operating system requires more resources then the computer can handle, so it just gets stuck on the loading screen. Which also often makes me feel tired, like I never fully wake up. 

 Very Occasionally I have good days where my head seems clear and i almost feel talkative - I‚Äôm generally a very quiet person and people often assume I‚Äôm shy, but my brain just can‚Äôt figure out what to say.

Anxiety,I haven't self harmed in one whole year.,"The last time I self harmed was about a year ago. (I know, even more depressing because it was near Christmas!)

I have been dealing with anxiety and self harm for three and a bit years now. I didn't ever think I would get a mental illness and the fact that the self harm evolved from that was even worse. It's so weird to think that this one thing happening in my life changed everything for me. It was all very sudden as well. I started locking myself away from friends and family, school became a hell hole and I was just alone with no idea what was going on with my head.

 I never got treatment. My mum tried to get some woman to help me, she came to our house and I swear to god...she was useless. I appreciate the fact that my mum wanted to help but there was apart of me that didn't want the help. I'd been living with this monster for so long, it started to feel like apart of my identity now. I was scared that I wasn't 'ill enough' or I would be wasting my time there, they wouldn't actually care and they were just greedy for money. Thinking about it now I understand how crazy that sounds of me to think like that but who could blame me from the state I was in?

My dad started to notice and became infuriated with me. It's difficult to explain to people who haven't gone through it, so that just made it worse. A few people that did stick around would pop up on my phone, and it was constant. They wanted to know how to help and even I didn't know what exactly was wrong with me. How can someone help if even you don't know what's wrong? I had completely lost touch with the real world.

Three years later, it's still extremely difficult but I persevere...because even though you may think it can't get better, it always does. I used to RAGE when ever anyone told me that but it's true.

To be honest, I don't think I will ever overcome my mental health, but I've been doing incredibly better thoughtout those three years. I've grown as a person, I've learnt new things, experienced new happy memories and I'm actually going to have a clean, joyful Christmas. This present time in my life is currently the happiest I've been since. The best part is that I'm thankful. Of course there are days when I think I wish it wasn't around but my mental health has taught me so much and made me stronger. I am thankful! So...THANK YOU ANXIETY! THANK YOU!

Remember to love your brain and your body. You only get one life, spend it the best way you possibly can. Give yourself breaks, if you are having a shitty day don't force yourself into anything, take a day off and pick yourself back up the following day. Don't let anyone tell you that you aren't 'ill enough' to get treatment or that your mental health makes you 'worthless'. There is so much more to life than pain and suffering.
And most importantly... Congratulate yourself for getting past even a couple of days, a few weeks, a few months. It might not seem like much to you but every extra day you don't self harm, you are beating it! I believe in you all.
Learn to love your brain <3

Anxiety,Does anyone‚Äôs anxiety manifest as irritability or negative thoughts towards yourself?,"I have a lot of physical manifestations from anxiety like chest tightness, nausea, headaches etc., but I find I often get irritable if I‚Äôm in a social setting for too long. I‚Äôll snap at the people around me, I get disoriented and withdraw. 

As well, I notice a tonnnnn of negative self talk. Maybe this isn‚Äôt so much anxiety, but I notice it nonetheless. For example, I had to write a paper for one of my classes and ended up doing extremely well on it, and I couldn‚Äôt just accept that I had done well. I kept thinking things like ‚Äúoh maybe everyone did well‚Äù or ‚Äúmaybe the prof just graded everyone really easily.‚Äù I also get irrationally angry at myself for having my anxiety in the first place. I‚Äôll catch myself saying things like ‚Äúwhy is your heart beating so fast, my god you‚Äôre just getting on the bus, it‚Äôs not a big deal.‚Äù 

Anyone else? I‚Äôm curious!

Edit: Thank you for all the upvotes and comments everyone!!! I really thought the irritability and negativity was uncommon with anxiety, it‚Äôs so comforting to know it‚Äôs not. Thanks for sharing your experiences with me, it helps me more than anyone will know.","Yup, this is one of my biggest signs I'm spiraling, I'm \*constantly\* comparing myself to everyone else and telling myself I suck/I'm too fat/I'm too whatever else my brain is fixating on.

Anxiety,First anxiety attack in front of boyfriend,"My boyfriend and I have been friends for nearly 2 years and have been dating for four months. Yesterday was the first time I had an anxiety attack in front of him. He has known that I have anxiety but he's never seen it first hand.

Well yesterday, I was hanging at his place anime on his computer when all of a sudden my anxiety overwhelmed me. I went to his bathroom for a minute hoping it would pass and then I broke down, I realized that I had been in the bathroom for too long so I quickly washed my face and went back out. Even though I had washed my face it couldn't hide the redness and puffiness of my face. 

At first he didn't see it because I was on my phone and hid my face with my hair, and then he laughed and pointed at the screen and looked over at me, immediately paused the show and went ""are you okay?""

That's when I pointed at my chest and through very narrow breaths said ""I'm.... having... an .... anxeity... attack""

He asked why, and when he realized I couldn't talk he grabbed my hand and rubbed methodical circles. 

Throughout the rest of the attack, if I told him not to touch me he'd lay off. If I told him to touch me he'd wrap me in an embrace. He even pointed at me and looked at our dog and said ""Mom's sad. Give her love"" to which our dog jumped on me and gave me dozens of kisses.

I just... aghast. I'm so happy he reacted the way he did. But in my head I thought he would have hated seeing my attack and would've reacted differently. I'm so happy he took it the way he did and I'm surprised as well. 

But goddamn I love that man.

&#x200B;

TL;DR I had an anxiety attack in front of my boyfriend and I thought he wouldn't reacted badly to it, but instead he held me if I needed it and backed off if I needed it and I really appreciated it","this is the type of wholesome content I needed today.

Anxiety,I brushed my teeth!,"Hi, everyone.

I don't tend to post here but I really wanted to tell someone that would not be disgusted by me. 

I have been deep in depression and anxiety for about 6 months. I went to the dentist in May due to an emergency. The dentist explained to me that I have beautiful teeth that just need some TLC after not brushing them for years. I remembered that about a year ago in Aug 2018, a friend gave a company-wide training on dental health. She urged everyone that electric toothbrushes are the best way to clean up dental health quickly.

With all this information in mind, I've been saving up money to go out and buy a Sonicare toothbrush with a gentle whitening toothpaste formula. Today, I finally did it. I bought everything I needed. I brushed my teeth for the first time in months. I have no more plaque buildup. I set an Alarmy reminder twice a day to go take a picture of a bar code on my bathroom mirror so I remember to brush my teeth. 

I'm crying because I finally did it. My teeth might just be saved.","That's a great habit to get into. Keep it up, I'm rooting for you!",933,50,8/14/2019 23:12,cqhkc3

Anxiety,Does anyone get anxiety from feeling like you're wasting your time?,"I've noticed that a pretty consistent trigger for anxiety is feeling like I'm wasting my time or other people are wasting my time. I'm currently doing a summer internship and mentally noted a few ""productive"" things I wanted to do in my freetime (such as reading books or learning HTML/CSS or working out). However, when I get back from work I find myself aimlessly scrolling through reddit or watching youtube videos. And my heart starts racing more as I become aware of how much time I just wasted. At that point, I feel so panicked that I can't do anything productive OR relaxing.

I think this is related to a fear that's often at the back of my mind - of aging and not doing anything important with my life. I place too much importance on developing new skills so then I'm scared of failure and am too anxious to do anything. For example, I bought a course to learn Unity but the thought of not grasping the material and failing to deliver  something good-looking makes me too scared to even start the program",All the time.

The whole time my conscious self knew that he's not talking to me because he's focused on whatever he was reading. My subconscious self tho, was yelling at me the whole time being like ""He's pissed at you, you must have done something to upset him and he probably hates you for it!""

This happens more than I'm willing to admit. The fact that I'm completely socially incompetent and often misread social cues doesn't help at all. Anyone else like that?","Every single day. Anything less than overt kindness (or in the case of texting, smile emojis and exclamation marks) makes me assume I've done something to make a person mad and that they now hate me.

I'm now unemployed, and genuinely trying to figure out what I'm doing with my life. It's Best to have this happen when you're still young, like late twenties, than fifties I suppose.  
  
My point is, you're going to have issues no matter what you do. It helps to remember that a job is just a job.",903,80,1/22/2019 11:41,aim1cd
Anxiety,Yesterday I had a panic attack at the dentist.,"Yesterday I wasn‚Äôt doing so well. I‚Äôm switching anxiety medications, so I‚Äôm going through a bit of withdrawal which isn‚Äôt fun. I thought about cancelling my dental appointment, but decided to go anyway. One of the nurses heard me state that I was having a bit of a panic attack, and I might need to do the x-rays another time. She took me back to the X-Ray room, and instead of prepping me for it, she told me that she had anxiety also, and she was willing to let me sit for a while to calm down. We talked for a while, and she told me I was very strong. She told me that she knows the struggles of anxiety as well, and they are very real. She actually started crying a bit, and I asked if I could hug her, which she accepted. 

After my appointment, I sat in my car for a while just thinking. I called my mom to tell her about it, and she started crying too. It‚Äôs nice to know I‚Äôm never alone. ","If you want to do her a favor, you may mention her in a positive review online.

Anxiety,"I've exercised every day for a week now, and I am so proud of myself!","A big part of my anxiety come from how others view me and how fat I am. (167 cm and 85 kg) and as with all anxious thoughts, I know they're a lie but, you know. 

So I started running at night so the chances of being seen lowered then on day 3, I was passed by another runner and instead of thinking, I got more motivated. Now I run during dusk which is an improvement I didn't expect.

It's a small step for a regular person, but a giant leap for me.

Edit: Thanks for all the support! It actually gonna make it even easier to run tonight!","Great news. I'm in the same boat, I think a lot of my anxiety stems from being overweight. I'm 5'9"" and just under 14 stone. I got into a good routine end of last year/ start of this with going the gym and I did feel it help my mood lift. The past few months I've slacked (for one reason or another excuse) and reading stuff like this reminds me how I need to get back to it. When I got into it I decided to not focus too much in weight loss and focus more on how it helps my mental health.",893,23,6/16/2019 8:30,c17suz
Anxiety,Does anyone else feel physically weak and tired after going through a long period of anxiety that eventually died down temporarily?,"I had a terrible week. I couldn't bring myself to do much of my school work on time because of my anxiety. By Thursday, I managed to calm myself down significantly but I'm feeling the consequences at the moment. My body is sore, my neck and head hurt constantly, and Once 8 pm hits, I feel like dropping unconscious to sleep (that's how tired I am). Is this normal?

Edit: u/ItchyLeftArm mentioned that this effect is ""General Adaption Syndrome."" Here's an article in case anyone was interested: [https://www.healthline.com/health/general-adaptation-syndrome](https://www.healthline.com/health/general-adaptation-syndrome)",Yes it is. You're exhausted. You're body's been in fight or flight all week and that burns a lot of energy. Eventually somethings gotta give and your energy eventually is gonna drop.,889,26,10/20/2019 5:02,dkf9qw
Anxiety,I signed up for Reddit a year ago this December. It took me almost the entire year to overcome my anxiety about posting for the first time,"I know it doesn‚Äôt look like much, but this post was almost one year in the making. Anxiety is a bitch.


Edit: My most heartfelt thanks to the kind redditors that have twice endowed me with silver! You guys are seriously amazing üíôüíô thank you for all the kind words and messages of encouragement.

Also, words",I only just realized Reddit had as much as it does.   Being able to see I‚Äôm not alone in what I‚Äôm going through has lifted my spirits enough to back me away from the edge for bit.,884,33,11/22/2019 0:41,dzt179
Anxiety,"Has anyone found that their ability to read text, write, and spell drastically goes down when anxious?",Just something that has been happening too much lately and was wondering if this could be contributed to anxiety.,"Yes! Physically I get tremors, so I end up typing some wild chaos instead of the simple, human text I meant to get to. I can‚Äôt focus to read, either; I get really jittery and it‚Äôs like the last thing I wanna do is be tied up on reading.",880,64,10/18/2019 12:46,djmzx4
Anxiety,I got rid of Facebook and Instagram today after 8 years.,"I couldn't feel better, it's like a weight has been lifted off me and alot of stressful ties cut. Now I can live in the real world without being too sucked into my phone, and the only people that can contact me are the people I want to be able to. For years I lived a very bad life, and now I feel safer it won't come back to bite me.",I went off social media in September of 2018. Best decision ever. ,882,61,4/7/2019 16:31,bai2a3
Anxiety,Does anyone else fear phonecalls?,"Basically, I have to admit, I struggle with calls, whether it's incoming or if I have to make one. I become all hot and shivery all of the sudden, and I can feel my pulse going nuts. It's something confronting, ""putting you on the spot"" about calls, that makes me extremely nervous - it's like taking oral exam without having prepared for it. Can anyone relate? Does anyone have ideas on why this fear might exist or how to overcome it?",Yeah I hate talking on the phone even if it's with people I know.. I have social anxiety idk if that has anything to do with that,876,107,12/4/2019 13:39,e5zco5
Anxiety,I got a 4.0 this semester in college!," I don't ever like to post anywhere about my grades, but I got two A+s and two A's this semester in college, making it a 4.0 for the semester! 

I've been told by therapists before that it's at least 10 times harder for me to do any given assignment in school than most students as a result of my anxiety. I had some really hard tests and assignments this semester, a hell of a lot of panic and test-related nightmares, but I did it. 

I'm at a relatively difficult college and I even suffered through a horrible kidney stone that caused me to miss two weeks of class and cost me a trip to the emergency room. I also had chronic bronchitis that caused a couple doctor's visits as well. I genuinely don't have friends at college or groups I belong in. I have depression alongside this shit anxiety and I went through this all alone, away from any family or anyone that could help.

It may not be much, but I did it, and I made it through. And you guys can, too! 

Please never hesitate to get the support y'all need. If you can, reach out to get accomodations with your school and if you get sick, let teachers know! Get doctor's notes. Most professors are more understanding than you'd think. 

Y'all got this! I hope anyone who's semester just ended had a great one, and everyone else have a great holiday break and happy holidays in general.","I also suffer from depression and anxiety, along with PTSD. And I‚Äôve been a straight A student ever since I got back to school after a 2 years gap to seek treatment. I do notice that I have to work 5 times harder than other student to achieve this. It‚Äôs really hard to do well in school and fighting depression at the same time, but I dedicate my time into school to minimize the time I spend for negative thoughts. Congrats on your achievement. You deserve it!!! Be proud of yourself.",881,29,12/20/2019 5:16,ed5jr6
Anxiety,"People who laugh, yell, and mock the people with anxiety and panic disorders are sad people.",They have no idea what we have been through or why we have such disorders. Truly people these days have 0 empathy and yes I mean empathy not respect. No one does anymore not police not nurses and hell definently not most of the general population.,I'd like to see them deal with something like depression or anxiety. See if they like it.,872,38,9/19/2019 2:27,d67nwf
Anxiety,I posted the other day about getting a job. Today was my first day I was so nervous last night I didn‚Äôt fall asleep til 3:30 and I worked from 8am to 5:30pm.

Anxiety,I hate it when being worried about anxiety related chest pains causes even more chest pains.,,This is exactly how I feel about nausea!

Anxiety,Something I REALLY gotta get off of my CHEST!,You are awesome. You matter. And I love you even if I don‚Äôt even know you. Keep moving forward because you‚Äôre worth it!!! <3,"I read positive messages like this constantly, and my friends and family CONSTANTLY tell me to just keep going, take things one day at a time, you're doing great!  ...

Anxiety,The worst thing for me about having generalized anxiety is I have anxiety about my anxiety.,"I constantly feel the need to explain to people why I constantly over think or internalize everything. I don't want people to think I'm this crazy, narcissist that thinks the world revolves around me so I explain that I have pretty severe anxiety issues.... and then I worry that I'm that annoying person who constantly feels the need to justify their actions or statements by leaning heavily on a health issue.... so then I apologize for bringing it up so much. 

My anxiety disorder is causing me anxiety. 

I just left a comment about not being able to sleep at night because my brain won't shut down and I can't stop analyzing everything that I said or did throughout the day. It went from 1 to 0 in less than a minute so I deleted the comment because it sounded whiny and a little crazy. Why do I care so much about what other people think? Why do I worry so much about how I come across to others? It's exhausting.

I'm feeling shity, might delete later. IDK üòò",[deleted],869,37,9/7/2019 2:11,d0q8ly

Anxiety,"Anyone else feel so anxious yet they instantly ""sober up""/relax when other anxious people are in need of your emotional support?","As the title says, I find that in really tough situations where I'm having a bad day - I instantly feel less tense when I see someone else suffering from severe anxiety. In fact, I always reach out to them (here and irl) and offer them advice which makes me feel better too. Now if only I took my own advice seriously...","It's often easier to help others with problems than try to deal with your own, since anxiety is often manifesting from an unconscious or subconscious place. But yes, this is something I've recently experienced. My sister is having emotional problems, and while I'm helping her, I get to momentarily forget about my own.
