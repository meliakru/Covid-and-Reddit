depression,"I hate that people don’t understand that i don’t want to kill myself, I just don’t want to be alive anymore",,Yeah. It would be nice to just disappear for a while,4725,133,2020-08-04 01:57:38,i3ajk8
depression,"It’s like I died at 15, but my body just kept on living.",I’m trapped inside. Does anyone else get that feeling? My memories from the past few years are shoddy at best.

depression,People that aren't depressed exist and it's fuckin insane to me.,"Like ???


I posted on AskReddit asking non-depressed people how they felt and I'm shocked. Not sure what I expected though.


You exist in this hellhole and you're just like... Chill with it? Like I'm so happy for these people but it's mindblowing! Like I have never known a time that I didn't experience severe recurring depression so it's just fuckin crazy that these people are real? One even said they don't understand how people can be depressed for seemingly no reason. Like I wish so much I could say the same.


Like logically I knew they must exist but it's still just unfathomable in my mind. It kinda makes me sad that I don't understand them just as much as they don't understand me. But I'm glad at least someone is happy in life. Idk man.",can you imagine waking up happy and being excited to face the day lmao,3601,128,2020-05-11 00:51:44,ghdi7l
depression,"I’ve wasted so much time being depressed, that I’m depressed about wasting time.",I can’t imagine how many days I have wasted to being sad and crying and not being able to accomplish the things I need to do. I have responsibilities I have deadlines and none of them seem to matter when I am in these dark episodes. How can you force yourself to do what needs to be done when you feel so hopeless and numb?,"I am feeling this exact feeling right now... I have so much to do, but I feel too numb to even start. But you've somehow inspired me to do something about that, so for the first step I'm going to just force myself to sit at my desk. Not too hard I guess. And then I'm going to play my favorite playlist on YouTube to make my hellish tasks a little bit fun at least. And finally I'm going to start studying for my Chemistry test -- even if I can only manage to do it for five minutes, that's better than lying in bed like I'm doing right now. And it's happened to me in the past where I started crying because of all the stuff that I procrastinated doing (love cramming before end of year exams), but I forgave myself, because I wasn't going to finish anything otherwise. It's incredibly difficult, but you have to stop thinking about what you could have done, and just focus on what you can do right now -- you have all the power to change that.

My dad always says that motivation only comes after your first action -- maybe that applies to you too right now. I feel like if I can do a little bit, it might inspire me to do more.

Anyway, all the best to you OP, I know you can tackle whatever it is you want to accomplish <3",3560,64,2020-10-24 16:46:02,jhc5fc
depression,I hate how people boast about how much they support mental illness then once they meet a mentally ill person they want nothing to do with them,"It's just so fucking tiresome. You see it everywhere on social media. People will go on and on and on about how we should all reach out to mentally ill people then when you have the courage to reach out to them the same fucking people will tell you bullshit like ""man up"", ""stop being so sensitive"", ""hey bro at least you're not a starving child in Africa"", ""bro it's just your mindset you gotta start thinking more positively"", and so on. Like what's the fucking point. Whenever we do reach out we either get scolded or our problems get dismissed. I'm not trying to say this is how it is for everyone but this is just from my experiences. 

I just want someone to fucking listen just once and for once I want to be able to tell someone about this without fear of eventually getting ghosted. Is that asking for too much?",[deleted],3555,112,2020-11-08 04:02:49,jq54zk
depression,Anyone keep switching from admitting to yourself that you have depression to invalidating yourself into thinking you were just playing victim?,"I know I have issues. But I go through manic mood swings, and while on the depressive end I feel like absolute shit, when I'm out of that phase and feel somewhat ""normal"" again I tell myself I greatly exaggerated the effect in my mind. It doesn't help that my self loathing won't let me admit that I have depression because I keep thinking I don't deserve to be depressed. So I invalidate myself and continue life until the next phase hits, and the cycle continues.","All the friggin time.

depression,"The worst part of the depression, is that feeling, deep deep down, that the reason you're depressed is because you want to be.","It's just the thought, that maybe you know how to be happy. Maybe all the stuff you read online, the stuff your family tells you, the stuff you hear from your therapist, maybe it all goes somewhere in your head. Maybe you've seen enough happy, normal functioning people, that you have some idea of how to do what they do. That maybe you've made the same mistakes enough times that you could point them out and stop repeating them.

It's the idea that, you know how not to be depressed, so if you still are, then that means you must want it this way. And if you want it this way, well that must mean you deserve it.

And I guess, that's probably not true, but sometimes, sometimes I just don't know.","Or maybe I'm not even depressed. Maybe I'm just lazy and have a horrible personality.

depression,"I don't want to die but if I was offered a chance to erase myself from existence, I would take it","Apologies in advance for the ramble that follows and for any mistakes as this isn't my native language.

No matter how busy I make myself, it all seems pointless in the end. What the fuck am I working towards ? Doesn't seem like I have any purpose in life even though I'm 26 and most people my age are making their careers and starting to settle down.

Anything I do is to distract myself from my thoughts but I end up at the same dark place at the end of every day. Honestly feel like instead of growing as a person, I deteriorated in the last few years.

I have no motivation left except that I love my parents and them having to witness my death will destroy them. If only there was a way to erase myself from everyone's memories.","I feel like this, I don't necessarily want to die but at the same time there's not much I want to live for either.",3408,92,2020-08-15 06:34:18,ia2nf9
depression,Anhedonia is the worst part of depression,"You're alive, but you aren't living. You feel like doing something, anything, but nothing is appealing. Everything feels like a chore, and it's exhausting. ""Do things that you enjoy doing"" doesn't work, since everything feels like watching paint dry. Realising that you're slowly beginning to lose interest in the few things you enjoy doing and realising that there's nothing you can do about it is mentally torturing. It's like trying to catch smoke with your bare hands; it's hopeless. The only thing you look forwards to is death.","I feel like I wrote this.

depression,I fucking hate dreams that make you feel love and make you feel happy,They just give you a taste of what you’ll never have and when your self-esteem is at an all time low it just makes you want to kill yourself even more,There's a Lovecraft book called Celephaïs.

depression,"Do you ever think, “Fuck, I just wanna go home,” but you’re already inside your “home”?","A house (or apartment) is surely different from a home, and it seems I haven’t had a home for many, many years now despite always having a place to stay. I understand it is a gift to have shelter, and I realize it may be insensitive to someone who is struggling with homelessness; this is just my experience.","I've heard it's actually a sign of wanting security. It's not ""home"" in the physical sense, but ""home"" in that you want to be somewhere that you feel safe and loved and wanted.

depression,"Life doesn't ""get better"" unless you take actions to MAKE it better. But depression itself can make it impossible to act","Exercise/physical activity, eating healthy, spending time in nature, finding a hobby are all things that are supposed to ""be good for your mental health""... but by definition, depression is a problem *precisely because* it inhibits your inability to function, much less do things that are good for you. Finding a therapist, trialling multiple therapists to see which one suits me best, or even starting on antidepressants and having to check in with a doctor/psychiatrist every few weeks, or having to change medications because one might fuck up my head even more, or not even work... all takes so much fucking effort that I can't bother to do any of it.

I went to a counsellor at my university earlier this year, and they suggested things like group therapy for my anxiety and volunteering for causes because that can give people a sense of purpose in day to day life... and I just didn't know how to tell them, that is exactly the problem, *I have utterly no will to do any of that and that's why I'm sitting in your office right now and I don't know what anyone can possibly do about me being this way*.

If people with depression were able to so easily do things to help themselves, we wouldn't need to classify it as an 'illness' or 'disorder'. That's why it's so infuriating when we see how even 'professional' mental health advocacy organizations repeat the hackneyed slogans which I cannot understand how they are even still in mass circulation.

It's so irrational and frustrating that I'm physically able to take ten steps out of the house to just go on a goddamn walk, but I have absolutely no mental will to do anything but lie in bed. Only listening to music is the only action that can be done purely passively with no effort whatsoever, but then I just get sad and start spiralling from guilt. And I can't stop thinking about how irrational it is, even though I've experienced it for so many years. I'm constantly surprising myself from my own incompetence, as if I ever expected anything different.

More than hopelessness, I just feel confused as to what I'm supposed to do when I can't will myself to do anything. What even is this anymore?

It’s hard to describe, but I feel very moved that there are people out there that I reached in a small way for a short moment of time.",Amen to this you’re spot on!

But as time goes on, the desire to leave just gets stronger and stronger so I try to distract myself by getting some more drinks to make it a bit more bearable but I still really just want to leave. But everyone is telling me that this is a great night out to be on and that I should just stay and try to enjoy myself. But I'm not enjoying myself. I'm just numbing my annoyance at not being allowed to leave with drugs and alcohol. I've got to the exit door a couple of times but I couldn't get any further than that. What's more annoying is that while I can get help to make the night out more manageable, I'm not allowed to just leave. I'm stuck here.

depression,Depression = Losing intelligence,"The worst part about depression for me, even worse than suicidal thoughts or constant pain, is the huge toll it has on my mental faculties. 

I think slower. I need longer for decision making and understanding pretty basic things in conversations. I can't plan anything because it is too much mental effort. I read a sentence in a book and don't register the information it's supposed to convey.

I can't think as deeply. As a teenager, I was able to hold my train of thought and look at a problem for a long time and find an intricate solution. That's gone. My ability to think any deeper than surface level is lost. 

I'm not improving my programming skills, even though I do it professionally on a daily basis. I just don't seem to have the mental capacity for improvement. 

It has been like that for years, even worsening, I'm worried that I'll just stay ""depression stupid"" forever. It's also completely ruining my future, because I can't make any sound decisions.

EDIT: This blew up over night, I'm thankful for the lively discussion in the comments, thanks for the awards. May you all find a way to get rid of this. Lots of love.","Yeah, that sucks. I feel the same way. Obsessive thoughts have made me less sharp, and depression has made me less alert. It's hard to get out of the spiral of negative thinking. 

But I'm trying to have confidence in the brain's plasticity, kind of like using the placebo affect to my advantage. Every time a negative thought pops into my head, I try to reinforce the neural networks that fight them or dismiss them. 

If you focus on the biological damage caused by the depression, it will only make you more depressed and cause more damage. But if you believe that you can heal, there's a good chance that you will or it will at least keep it from getting worse. Don't underestimate the mind-body connection. 

I also try to put more effort into practicing my guitar since playing instruments and listening to music are good for the brain.

depression,I (24 f) got dressed and did a bit of my makeup to meet up with a friend at a coffee shop. I’m in the middle of a depressive episode and dealing with some great difficulties in my personal life. She didn’t show up. This was my attempt to “reach out”.,"Update:

Sorry in advance, I’m on mobile and this is long. 
I really wasn’t expecting this amount of support and kindness from so many people. Thank you all for the uplifting words and thank you for the rewards! 

I’d like to first address any concerns about meeting up during the pandemic. My friend and I made plans to meet up at a coffee shop, buy a quick cup of coffee, and then immediately head to a park nearby in separate cars. The coffee shop is on small a military base so that cuts the amount of people that were in there down by a lot. I went ahead and grabbed coffee and then waited on a bench outside of the shop for around 30 minutes or so before leaving. I stayed 6 feet away from others and wore a mask the entire time. I played it safe and went by the rules.

Next I’d like to say thank you to those who have helped me realize how big of an accomplishment it was for me to get to the coffee shop. It really did take a lot of effort and I appreciate the reminder that it took strength I didn’t know I had. 

I also want to thank those who have expressed empathy towards my friend. She is going through a rough time and has been since long before the pandemic started. I wasn’t angry at her because I understand that she’s struggling too. I was just really sad and disappointed because I’ve only seen her once since last year. It was more of a bummer than anything and I just needed somewhere to get it off of my chest so I came to Reddit. Kind people of Reddit, you did not disappoint! 

I’m going to continue being her friend because she is very dear to me. Knowing the kind of person she is, she probably truly forgot, there was a potential miscommunication, or she may have had something come up that she couldn’t get out of. It would have been nice to get a bit of a heads up or an explanation, but I haven’t dwelled on it too much. She’ll reach out when she’s ready to. If not, then I understand that too. 

I’ve been in therapy and medication since 2018 and recently sent a cease &amp; desist letter and went no contact with my mother. As a result of that I haven’t heard from my Dad since it happened. I also live states away from my childhood friends and what’s left of the family that supports me (not many people). I’m better off being out of that toxic environment but it’s still a grief process losing people that are still alive. I have also been grieving what could have been if I only had healthy and supportive parents. 

I’m also struggling with my marriage. I’m a military spouse and it’s hard being so far away from the little support I have states away (my sisters). I won’t go into detail here about my rocky marriage but it’s been traumatic and hard. I haven’t gotten much support other than therapy and the support my younger sisters have been capable of giving. I’m in the process of filling out divorce papers and working with an attorneys office to explore my options. 

I also had surgery at the end of October to repair a hernia. It wasn’t too big of a deal, and my sisters came from out of town to visit during my recovery, but it did knock me down a bit emotionally because I was restricted from carrying anything over 20 pounds. That meant I couldn’t hold my toddler who is 30 pounds and that was really hard on both of us. 

It just would’ve been nice to be able to have hung out and talked to the one friend I have here about everything going on. It honestly would’ve been nice to talk about things that have nothing to do with all of the crap that has  gone on this year too. 

It’s okay though! Life will carry on and there will be better days. I still got my coffee, got outside, then came home and hung out with my son and put up Christmas decorations. 
I also got a ton of fantastic advise and support from you lovely folks. Thank you again!

TL;DR Thank you for the support and kind words! I’m not mad at my friend, just sad we couldn’t meet up. I followed social distancing rules when going out. 2020 has sucked but personally, so has the past decade or so.","I know we're supposed to be focusing on the 2nd half of your story, but I really want to applaud you for the first half. 👏 You made plans! 👏 You got dressed nicely! 👏 You even put on makeup! 👏 You didn't cancel and you made it to the coffee shop! 👏 Yay, congrats!! 👏👏👏

depression,"I'm black, I'm scared, tired and I'm at the end of my rope with life.","Jesus, how do I even start. As you could read by the title, I'm a black man. I've always been in the fight. Grew up with racism in all its forms in my country, which, ironically, usually denies there ever being racism in any way.

The kind of shit I've heard through my entire life has molded me into someone with no self-esteem, sense of self-worth, voice and made into introvert. Because of the mentality of ""you need to work twice as hard as everyone out there"", I always saw the future as bleak, tiresome and as more struggle. This never really changed. It just got worse with time, with college and the awful reality that came afterwards.

I've been depressed for most of my life, with my initial diagnosis at age 9. I still have it, with severe anxiety. My first suicidal thoughts came at age 8, and then and there I already hated myself for everything. For not being enough, for not being what the world wanted, for failing myself at being the best, for never getting anything good out of my own life, for never letting myself rest or be human.

And with all the recent events, like the absurd police brutality worldwide, the rise of authoritarianism in my country, with being worked to the bone and around the clock due to the pandemic, with my country quickly moving up to be the worst afflicted by covid-19 and my mom and me being in danger during these times by living in a neighbourhood near a place where a white supremacist parade happened, which also happens to be a place where a lot of people are simply disrespecting quarantine... All of this shit, is just wearing me down really badly.

I wake up exhausted. I can't deal with anything without having a serious bout of anxiety or anger outbursts, followed by fullscale breakdowns. I'm feeling guilty by worrying my friends and my mom. I feel guilty by feeling tired, by feeling afraid. I feel guilty by not feeling brave enough to go out on the streets for my people and taking action. I feel guilty for existing. I'm so fucking exhausted and I don't know what to do. I just want it all to end, I just wanna go somewhere else. I can't handle anything anymore.

Edit: all of this support... I'm very, very thankful for it. I think I've never felt this supported in my whole life. All of your words have touched me deeply. I'm so glad you helped me. I feel more hopeful, more energized from talking to you all. Thank you. Thank you all, from the bottom of my heart. You've all stopped me from doing something terrible today. Thank you.

Edit 2: wow, I was not expecting this kind of response from so many people. I'm trying to respond to everyone, but I think I can't. I'd like to thank you all once more for all your words. I'm very glad that I vented about all these feelings here with you all. I feel so much support from you and I feel like my feelings are valid and worth feeling. It may seem a bit dramatic, but I'm legitimately walking out of this with a different outlook on life. I never expected to see so many people I don't know just rush in to support me when I'm in my absolute worst. So thank you, once more for being here for me. I mean it.

It's disappointing to come back to my real life and realize what I am. I've done nothing with my life for the past 8 years. And nothing is moving forward. I compare myself to other men my age, and I am a failure in every aspect. I am no better today than I was 5 years ago.

You knew about my trauma and mental illness from day one! Why even entertain the idea of wanting me if you were just gonna reject me for things outside of my control anyways! Do you know how devastating and invalidating that is? That’s like saying someone with a disability can’t love someone because they’re not “normal”.

It is hard because unless you have experienced it, you really do not understand what the other person is going through and even then, we all handle things differently. I imagine most of the guys just do not realize what they are unpacking and rush blindly into it. It sucks. 

Whats even worse is if you find someone who empathizes and genuinely connects with you, it can be self-destructive for both of you.

Trust me, I completely understand how you feel, I still struggle with the same issue.  
One thing I have done that has helped me is to tell myself that my brain isn't my best friend sometimes, as hard as it may seem, he will will lie to you over and over again if you let him. He will tell you that he know reality better than anyone else around you, and that they're all in on his sick joke.  


Do you best to hear him and tell him that he's wrong, I could guess that there are people around you that do think highly of you in one way or another. Whatever you do, don't run away from your issue that is making you hate yourself.  Face it head on and then go from there. Journal if you have no one you trust to be vulnerable with, but really search yourself to find out how you could try and love yourself again.  


Obviously this is easier said than done, and I know nothing about your situation, but these are some of the things that have helped me in my struggle to try and love myself again after hating spending years hating myself and smoking my problems away.

depression,Being depressed and having depression are different.,"I have clinical depression. I was diagnosed about 5 years ago. It really hits me hard sometimes. One of my friends does not understand that people can 100% get depressed because of nothing. She thinks people only get depressed for a specific reason. Such as someone passing away, or a horrible break up. And those things are awful, those feelings are valid and the literal worst. But, she doesn’t understand that people can just be depressed for basically no reason at all. I’m currently having a depressive episode. Nothings wrong. I just can’t get out of bed... I can’t do the dishes. I can’t pick up the take-out off my bedroom floor. I can’t. 

I just.. I can’t hear the “but.. why are you depressed?” question one more time. Fortunately and unfortunately, I’ve been dealing with this illness for long enough that I know that this feeling will end, and I know how to somewhat manage it. But, if she were to say that to someone else.. I just worry that it could end someone’s life. 


Anyway, that’s all. I’m sure no one will even read this. K bye

Edit: I’m really happy this post caused some awesome conversations hopefully made people feel less alone in the fact that you can be depressed about nothing. 🥰","this!!! my worst depressive episode seemed to happen basically overnight. literally it was like fine one day, awful the next. and then when it ended, it was overnight as well. just so difficult to explain that nothing happened, yet I am still depressed.",2524,87,2020-08-21 20:07:14,ie47wl

depression,I hate how fast I go from being okay to empty and depressed,"I was doing fine this past month, I’ve been getting up early and being productive and just being okay for once. I started talking to this girl and things were perfect, we have lots in common and we seem to be on the same boat on things. I haven’t been in a relationship in a while but she made it clear she wants to be with me in time. Yesterday I invited her to hang out with my friends and I and she was just so different than she is when we’re alone. When I tried to hold her hand she didn’t let me. Afterwards she texted me and said she’s not ready after all and realized it when I tried to show affection in front of my friends. We’ve only been talking for about 2 weeks so it didn’t completely destroy me, but I just always get attached quick so I’m still upset about it. It seems like every person I see myself with always tends to end things for one reason or another and I’m over it. 

Being a front line worker is exhausting as it is, but having a failed “almost relationship” again is messing with my head and I’m starting to feel the darkness overwhelm my thoughts when I’ve spent the majority of the last few years working on fixing that. It’s hard when I put all my effort into people that don’t do the same back. You know when you stare into nothing and start overthinking everything about your life? I’m starting to think I’m the problem behind all these failed relationships. I know she’s not worth it, I don’t think it’s her specifically making me feel this way as much as the patterns that keep occurring in my love life. I don’t know what to do anymore.

tdlr; things were fine until they weren’t and I just don’t know what to do anymore","Same here. I go from being okay to super depressed and hopeless in a matter of seconds. The drop is so devastating and the depression and emptiness is so unbearable :/. It's truly the worst.

depression,I secretly hope that I will be diagnosed with a terminal illness so I can die without taking my own life,"Hey Reddit. Drunk me here, mainly looking to vent because I have noone else. No alts because fuck it, might dox myself.

Picture this, I met a woman. I fell in love. Hopelessly in love. Three years later, she gets pregnant. We were both young, and scared, but I tell myself I will do anything I can to make it work.

I have a baby. I cry. I promise MY baby girl the world, and the love I never had. But then things change.

The woman lives with her parents, I no longer can stay there with her and her family due to ""covid."" Okay thats fine. Go to the store? Quarantine for two weeks. Saw someone? Quarantine for two weeks. Quickly realized my opinion is not regarded about the baby. My input has no sway on how to raise her. Suddenly feel like a babysitter, I am ""allowed"" to come over after work, watch the baby, while her mom ignores me.

Eventually the woman I fell in love with starts being distant. It's little things at first. She doesn't want to cuddle. She stops kissing me. She stops inviting me to things. Then she tells me she's gay.

I decide I can make it work right? I love this woman! She says she wants to be with me still? I'll make it work of course. But then she starts antagonizing me. Insinuating I am a bad father for not being there full time for the baby when I dont have a choice. Ignoring me. Arguing with me.

I am... heartbroken. I don't know how else to describe it. I can't help but ask myself if I did something wrong. I keep telling myself I can make this work but it only gets worse. I have recently fallen into the worst depression of my life. I have had a couple suicide attempts in the past, the only thing stopping me now is knowing I would be leaving my baby girl without a father.

I dont know what to do. I donf know what this post was to accomplish. Maybe to rant? Get this off my chest? Who knows. I sure don't.

Edit: I barely remembered making this post. Was too afraid to look at the replies for awhile but I'm glad I did. You guys have given some real good advice and I'm thankful for it, thank you.","As a mom, I would say if you want to be a part of your child’s life and she isn’t allowing it for no reason other than she doesn’t love you anymore, then fight for split custody.

depression,My therapist gave me an advice that I wanted to share,"As a part of my mental illness, I suffer from strong self doubts and feelings of being worthless. And I often got told that if I have these, I need to think very positively about myself and realise that these thoughts aren't true. But it never worked, my negativity is way too strong to be able to habe any positive thoughts about myself, let alone to have stronger positive than negative thoughts.

So my current therapist suggested another approach. She said, instead of forcing myself to think positive, I should try to not evaluate myself at all for a certrain time. Neither negatively nor positively (though the second is rather rare anyway). What this does is that it gives some distance to the negative thoughts and therefore breaks that cycle of depression where depression makes me have negative thoughts and the negative thoughts make me depressed.

This is way easier because I just have to be neutral instead of positive and I notice what she means with breaking the cycle. I hope that this might help someone here.

Edit: I don't know what to say right now... Last time I looked at my phone this had 10 upvoted and I was so happy that 10 people considered this useful and now I see this... Thank you so much, this means the world to me.","OP, what you’re describing is a part of practicing mindfulness! Having positive thoughts might be the ultimate goal but being able to shift one's perspective to a more neutral approach can be so helpful! It's still hard, of course, and you have to exercise. My therapist taught me this strategy when we were talking about my body issues. I had to describe my body and its parts in front of a mirror, no judging though, only describing. Practicing this strategy does something with your brain – it changes the bad cognitive patterns you developed over time. This is why behavior therapy works. Negative thoughts turn into negative feelings, not the other way around. 
(You probably already know all of this, OP, but if other users want to take a deeper look into how psychological processes and mental illnesses work: this therapeutic intervention is called psychoeducation)

I'm really glad you found a strategy that helped you!! I wish you all the best for your recovery!",2415,52,2020-11-08 22:18:43,jqkwz0
depression,I don't want to kill myself but I wish I was never born,"Life is too much. Really. I could never killed myself bc I'm too much of a coward to indulge me any kind of harm, but those days I just don't know what to do.

I'm always waking with the urge to die, I cry myself to sleep, when I wake up I cry as well it just doesn't seem to stop.

1. Don't measure yourself or your worth against others; this is a surefire way to self-sabotage. There is no timeline you have to follow other than the one that works for you. You don't have to do x by 20, or meet someone by 21. This is literally a trap.

2. Forgive yourself. You're going to make mistakes, and your depression will probably always worsen the blow of those mistakes. It's ok.

While age isn't relevant (goes back to my timeline comment!), you're young and there's much more to come. It's not all going to be easy, but it's going to be your experience and story to create. In the meantime, you should definitely look into resources that your uni might offer or elsewhere, as professional help is almost always better than none at all.

depression,I feel like depression makes me more stupid,"Like it's harder for my brain to work.  Like I'm in the middle of a fog.  I make stupid mistakes at work.  I wonder if I'm mentally handicapped.  I have thoughts of, what if I'm no longer mentally able to do my job?  That scares me.

EDIT:  Finally got back here and wow, did this take off.  I went through every last one of your comments.  I'm in a brain fog even as I write this so I don't have the right words but thank you for all your stories, support, advice, information and so much more.

Well part of that dark room was not understanding the mental handicaps, and possible permanent loss of function, that go along with this disease.

depression,"I’m 19, my girlfriend was murdered, the trial is soon and I’m getting more and more depressive","Hi y’all,
Well I'm not used to posting on forums but I feel so bad atm and I can't open up about this to my family, my friends or my therapist even if they want that, I feel completely unable to talk about it with them.
I’m a 20yo man. I‘m Irish but my family moved to France when I was 5 and that is where I have lived since.
I grew up in a small country village, the school had only two classes. I hardly spoke French but I got a friend very quickly, I’ll call her Honey in this post.
 So Honey and I were friends all our childhood, we were in the same class every year and we were also neighbors so we played together every day after school. Year after year I became bilingual in French and made lots of friends, but I started to have a crush on her.
When I was 11 we started middle school, we were still in the same class and all our classmates were trying to get us together, but we were pretty shy at that time so we didn't dare to « flirt ». Finally it was the following year, when I was 12 years old, that we got in relationship. Ofc the feelings I had for her weren’t as strong as those I had for her when we grew up up because we were still young but I was so happy.  She was the first girl I kissed, the only one actually.
We kept growing up, we were always in the same class every year and we kept spending all of our time together. If I explain that, it’s so that you understand that from my 5 to 19 years I almost spent every day of my life with her, she gradually became as essential as breathing for me. The more the years went by, the more « serious » (important to each of us) our relationship became. We never argue, ofc sometimes we didn’t agree with each other but we knew how to put our differences aside and respect the point of view of the other.
Then when I was 15 we started high school, at that time we were in a relationship for almost three years and people were amazed by the longevity of our couple, because at that age it’s unusual.
But we loved each other so much (and I still love her so much), it was like I had found the perfect person to me and I don't want to speak for her but I felt like I was perfect to her.  We kept growing up, we did our first time together (and all the others, I never had sex with another girl). We wrote long love letters to each other, any pretext was good to say how much we loved each other. I mean, I'm kinda  that cliché of the chunk rugby player, people don't really imagine me doing that, yet for her I‘d have done anything and everything, she was so exceptional, I felt incredibly privileged to be part of her life.
We graduated high school and that summer we moved into our apartment, then started university. I was so glad to live with her, to sleep with her every night. Of course our parents let us sleep together on weekends and holidays but it wasn’t the same, it was a new step in our relationship and we were so happy.
When I explained to my new mates from the university that I had been with my girlfriend for 6 years they were stunned, they asked me if I had never wanted to flirt with another girl or anything and the answer has always been no : since my childhood, I grew up alongside this exceptional girl and I always dreamed of being with her and I felt so lucky to be in a relationship with, I never even noticed any other girl. I found her perfect in every way.
We were so happy. I just want to tell you a little bit about the great person she was. She was so heart warmed, she couldn’t stand injustice. She always wanted to help others. She was so kind and caring. Whenever our friends needed advice or support for something she was the one they call, she was full of wisdom and good intentions. She was always smiling, she illuminated people's lives with her presence.  She was a very funny person as well.  She always saw the bright side of everything, she was so positive. She never gave up, she worked hard to reach her goals. She was so clever, I’d even say brilliant, she was a very gifted student. She was passionate : when she did something she put her whole heart into it.  She made people feeling special, she knew how to bring out the best in them. She always complimented everyone, she was adorable. She was also sensitive, she hated seeing the ugly things of the world, she could cry for that.  But she was also someone who made the world more beautiful by her mere presence.  I’ve never met someone so selfless and altruistic. She was also incredibly beautiful, the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen. She was an angel, for her friends, for her family, for me, for my family who loved her too. My mam has three sons and she was used to say that Honey was like her daughter.  My little brother was kinda an hooligan when he was younger and listened neither to my parents nor to me.  She spent so much time helping him, because of her he really took control of his life again.
Everyone loved her, literally.  She was wonderful. She was someone who loved to pamper people.  She could spend weeks making a gift or a surprise for someone, but she was always embarrassed when someone gived a gift to her. I think she was one of the few people who was sincere when they said they preferred to give than to receive.
I felt so good with her, she was the love of my life, literally. I always wondered how she could love me so much, I mean I‘m not that bad and I always did my best especially for her but she was so much better than me. And yet she still looked at me like I was one of the wonder of the world.
We were so happy. I was only 19 years old and yet I saw my life with her and she saw her life with me, we had lots of plans. And even beyond me, she was a great person, who was so young and had her life ahead of her. I mean, if we had broken up, it’d have been incredibly hard but at least she would have kept existing, living, shining as she deserved.  But I cannot bear what happened.
We were together, so happy and in love, I never could have believed that she will  disappear so quickly and in such a brutal way.  No one deserves that and when it happens to someone so close to you, someone you love so much, it’s extremely harsh.
It was a Sunday and we were at our parents’ for the weekend. Sometimes on weekends we slept together and sometimes we slept on our own and we just spent the day together.
On Saturday evening we slept each on our own, her at her parents’ and me at mine, there wasn’t even a particular reason. On Sunday morning she wanted to run for an hour and offered me but I was lazy. I was tired, I wanted to stay in bed an hour more.  It’s absurd : I was studying sports science and I was too lazy to go running. I‘d never forgive myself.
It’s an ongoing case so I’m not allowed to speak in detail about it and anyway it doesn’t have to be, but she was violently assaulted and tortured and died, and then her body was burned. Suspects were arrested a few weeks later, it was in Feb 2019 and the trial was supposed to be in May 2020 but it was postponed because of the coronavirus (France is in quarantine).
I cannot even describe the infinite pain I felt when a few days after his disappearance, while very important research was being carried out, her body was finally found and we knew what had happened to her, I had a blackout.
Since I woke up from this fading away I have been taking heavy psychotropes, that doesn’t prevent me from constantly having anxiety attacks and having to take a fuck ton of sleeping pills to sleep, otherwise I have awful nightmares. I never thought I‘ll fall so low one day, I have always been someone very happy and full-blown.  But I never thought that the love of my life was going to be murdered one day either.
I haven't been going to university since, I don't do anything except think about her all day, I saw a lot of therapist but they only say shit, how am I supposed to accept the sudden death of the  person I love the most in the world and with whom I grew up believing that we were going to spend our lives together ? They tell me about the emotions of mourning but the only emotions I have are deep feelings of hopelessness and hatred towards those who did this.
I feel even worse since I know who did this and what their ""reasons"" were, because they were people I knew. I feel devastated. Sometimes I want to kill myself and sometimes I want to avenge her by killing them. But I feel unable to inflict this pain on my parents, who are very friends with Honey's parents (They had been friends for a long time before, because we are neighbors) and who help them a lot to hold on since it happened, I can see that they have the fear is that I kill myself and to be in the same state as the parents of Honey.
Her parents are suffering so much, they lost their only daughter and I don't know what to do to relieve their pain. Whenever I speak with them they seem so happy all of a sudden, they say that Honey kept living through me. But imo it's not true, she no longer lives and will never lives again and I miss her so, so much. But I know if they say that it’s because they miss her so much too. She is missed by everyone who knew her, she was so wonderful. And I will always miss her.
People tell me that one day when I’ll be happy again and I‘ll meet someone else and go back to normal life. But I know it’s wrong, first I‘ll never be happy again, how am I supposed to live without her after growing up with her ? She was as essential to me as breathing, it’s unbearable to survive since she‘s no longer there, how can I resume a normal life ? And how can I meet someone else ? I never wanted when I was happy and she was there to meet someone else so it isn’t now that I‘m desperate without her that I‘ll want to meet someone, plus she is irreplaceable. I feel devastated. She is the only one I want and yet I know she‘ll never come back. I constantly think of her, of her laughter, her smile, her scent. I bought her perfume and I spray it on my pillow every day, I know it's stupid but it's the only thing that helps me sleep a little better. I just wanna hug her again. Sometimes when people lose a loved one they say they regret not telling them how much they mean to them and at least I’m « relieved » that Honey knew how much I loved her and how important she was to me when she passed away, because I told her every day.
Just before the quarantine there was a commemoration for the one year of her death and everyone looked at me with pity. As I no longer go to class, in rugby or to see my friends I don’t see anyone and I had not seen some people for several months, they were dazed by my appearance. And I hadn't realized but actually I became the shadow of myself, I always was very « strong » and now I‘m extremely bony. It depressed me even more to see how many people seemed concerned when they saw me. That's why I avoid my friends, they don't know what to say (and I understand that's normal, in their place I wouldn't know what to say either) and they‘re also embarrassed not to know what to tell me.
The only person I used to open up to is Honey, and now having to deal with such difficult emotions without knowing to who open up is very painful. My family is trying to support me as much as they can but it's very hard, there was a very bad atmosphere at home, so much so that my parents broke up and my father went back to Ireland with my older brother. I feel like my mom and little brother don't know what to do with me anymore. But I don't know what to do with me either. I think that after the trial I‘ll go to Ireland for a while as well, just to take a break, here every time I go out everyone is aware of what happened, throughout the region (and even outside, but here they recognize me so they look at me with that pitying air that depresses me even more).
I’m not afraid of the judgement, I know they‘ll have a long sentence but I‘m very afraid of the trial in itself and to, during a week or two to, hear what she has been through in detail all day, to see her murderers and to hear what they‘re going to say, I‘m anxious I cannot bear it.  For the moment I’m trying not to think about it. I spend all my time in the tree hut that his father built between our gardens when we were younger. We spent all our time there, when we were teenagers and our parents didn’t want us to sleep together we secretly met there and stayed all night. Everything remained as it’s, when I’m there I feel calmer.
I feel like nothing can ever ease my pain, I don't even know why I came to tell my story here. I just needed to open up and I can't do it with my loved one. I don’t think anyone will have read this anyway.","wow, this is truly horrific and heart breaking. this genuinely makes me feel sad that such a lovely person so full of life was taken from the world. we need more people like her. i truly hope they find the monster that did this. and im so sorry for your loss. just so you know, you will never stop hurting from your loss however, you will learn to live with it and it will fade over time. i didnt know her but how you described her gives the impression that she'd hate to see you this way. when the times right, youll know its time to move forward and you will meet new amazing people. eventhough you said that you dont want to talk to your therapist, i really think you should, whether you have to force yourself to do it or not. they can offer you so much more support. its not going to be easy but you can do it.",2347,115,2020-04-26 13:55:59,g8eq07

depression,Forcing myself to do things makes me hate them. Doing nothing makes me hate myself.,"The first advice you see on googling depression is 'do things you used to enjoy!', right? Well, I've gotten really good at making myself do things. I make myself do my job. I make myself do a side hustle. I make myself read books and post about them on my blog. This month, I'm making myself do NaNoWriMo.   


I presume the idea is that, at some point, you start enjoying things again, but I haven't ever managed to get to that stage. I dread my side hustle. I never know what to say about books until I start writing. I write exactly the number of words I need to hit my goal and then I stop. I don't enjoy any of it. Some of it, I really hate. And I've been doing the side hustle for a year and five months, and the blog for two years, so it's not a matter of it 'give it time'. 

&#x200B;

I don't know how to make myself do things if I don't treat them as obligations. Anything optional, I just don't do. It feels like a vicious cycle where the only way to make myself do something also makes me hate it! Is there a way around this? Has anyone else felt this? I can't seem to find anything online that even mentions this being a problem, let alone actually proposing a solution.

depression,"Having wonderful, loving, supportive family doesn’t make you any less depressed.","I have two extremely loving parents, a supportive sister, and a handful of close friends who I know would always listen if I needed it. I am still extremely depressed and ready to end it all. I attempted suicide 4 years ago, ended up in the psych ward for 2 weeks, and my family and friends visited every day. 

I can barely function anymore. I try so incredibly hard every day to be normal, to work, walk, chat, and appear fine. Mentally, I am thinking about killing myself for hours every day. Today I lost it, blew off work, and slept the entire day. I cried to my mother and she cried with me. Asked me what I needed, willing to do anything, but it doesn’t help. 

There isn’t anything wrong with me. I’m young, pretty, thin, and am capable of making friends and keeping them. I have a STEM degree, I’ve had committed relationships. None of that makes me happy. The true tragedy of my life is that I know I could do more, be more, and I just cant. 

I’ve been told I am strong because I haven’t done drugs or drank, because I powered through my degree, because I haven’t killed myself. I’m not strong, I’m guilted. Having a family who loves you and you love is a double edged sword. 

Love doesn’t cure depression. It does wrack you with guilt if you even think of attempting it. It would destroy my family. I’m not exaggerating. They have all told me individually, may times, that it would. My parents would never forgive themselves. I would haunt them forever.

I tried therapy. After I got out of the hospital I was on anti-depressants. I tried different meds, I saw 4 different therapists. It all just made it so much worse. One of my therapists almost got me involuntarily recommitted to the hospital. Her talking to my parents and ensuring they would be picking me up and taking me home was the only thing that saved me. 

Even the “good” therapists just made me feel worse. I would leave every appointment more depressed than I came in. I quit trying that after a year. The thing about therapy is that you are forced to lie. I was suicidal but couldn’t talk about it. If they suspect anything you get the cops called on you and they forces you into the prison that is the psych ward. They force medication on you, get you fired from your job, and destroy whatever remnants of a life you had. 

My mother is a certified grief councillor. She volunteers in hospice and regularly supports grieving people. She can’t help me. Talking to her is pointless. She will cry and beg me not to. It doesn’t make me feel better, just guilty.

All this rambling because the truth is that I am without hope. My family is dragging me through life. All the love in the world and it doesn’t make a fucking difference. Drugs, therapy, doesn’t matter. Depression is a death sentence and there is no cure. 

My only hope is to distance myself from them and one day just do it. Push them far enough away that they grieve me and move on. That way, killing myself won’t affect anyone.

Edit: thank you to people who are commenting. I am having a hard time finding words to reply to people. I dont really express myself easily.

I really appreciate everyone here. Its nice to feel understood.","This, sooooo much. Its like you're stuck between a rock and a hard place every single waking moment of the day.

depression,nobody cares when you're depressed until you commit suicide,wait suicide just passes the pain to next person,"I used to think this, and I've brought up my suicidal ideation with several friends now and it's changed my view.

Firstly, they don't know what to say, which I expected. There's not much they can do right?

But what shocks me is after I bring it up, they don't check on me. I go days off contact, no-one reaches out.

Genuinely think if I died in my flat, the first one to notice would be my boss. If I committed suicide on the Friday evening, I probably wouldn't be found until Tuesday. Scary thought",2206,69,2020-01-04 05:58:22,ejsoej
depression,I'm so fucking tired of begging for help. I NEED HELP. Being ignored is why I'm going to wind up dead.,"I'm so tired of my feelings being ignored by my friends and family. I'm tired of the emotional abuse I have been through. I'm tired of dealing with having bpd. I literally cannot do this anymore. I CAN'T. I feel so empty and nothing feels worth doing, I have no friends, and I'm hurting. I don't know how I'm going to do it, but I'll find a way. I genuinely believe that in killing myself I will finally find some peace.

I truly don't think anyone cares about me or that this will hurt anyone, but I'm sorry if it does. I'll be watching over you from above and same to anyone dealing with these same issues.

I'm sorry I just can't do this.

depression,"Depression can cause weight gain or weight loss, but saying you've not been eating is seen as much more socially acceptable than saying you've been eating too much. Even though the cause is pretty much the same.","I've both gained and lost weight due to depression, but I feel people see weight gain as much more embarrassing or just overall negative than if you *lose* weight as a result of depression.

It hurts.","It's tough yeah, been in both boats (quite the chubster rn), but people will remind me about and compliment how I looked a while back when I was so unhappy I couldn't eat.

depression,I just killed my pet bird.,"What is even the fucking point anymore? I took my bird out when the door was open and it flew off my shoulder. In a moment of panic I slammed the door... right onto his head. Everyone in my family is telling me “it’s not your fault” and “it was a mistake”, but guess who always fucking makes mistakes? ME. And now my mistakes are causing the deaths of those I love. I hate myself so much I don’t even see the point of going on anymore.

depression,I feel like I’m getting dumber and dumber everyday.,"I don’t know if there’s something physically wrong with me or if it’s just stress related, but for about 2 years now, I feel as if my cognitive abilities have been worsening. 

I can barely hold a conversation anymore. When I do talk, I stutter/stammer/mispronounce words. My mind blanks out a lot and my attention span is nonexistent. 

I used to be a really smart kid. Performed very well on the SAT despite having awful grades due to feeling indifferent about school. Then after high school, I became a full blown hypochondriac along with having generalized/social anxiety as well. 2 years ago I felt like I was THE man, and today I feel like an incompetent moron who becomes less functional each day. I think I’m recovering from my anxiety disorders, but I sometimes wonder if I’m actually just normalizing them, causing the illusion of recovery.

I don’t know where to go. I’ve really been trying to get better but I feel like I go two steps forward and three steps back. Can anyone else relate to this? Currently typing this out standing in the shower, feeling pretty down right now.

depression,Perhaps what's worse than depression is not being able to realize if you're having the best time of your life or the worst because it all feels the same.,"I'm having a really hard time keeping up with life, especially since the lockdown started. I just don't feel like I have anything to live for. I *do not* want to be happy. I just don't understand what happiness is to be completely honest. That is not to say that I'm unhappy and miserable, what I'm saying is that happiness and sadness has become the same thing for me. I just can't separate the two. On top of that, there's this feeling of guilt I keep having about everything. I *am* from a rich family, people have always expected me to be on top of everything ever since I learned to walk, but I was never able to be on top. I've always sucked at everything. I tried to be on top, but never made it. And so now I'm this 21 year old uni student. And I've been hammered so much with that mindset of trying to get to be best at everything, and since I've always failed at that, I feel safer as a failure. I just *do not* feel that I want to succeed. I've become an emotional masochist. Sometimes I imagine that a loved one would come and choke me to death to put me out of this misery and leave me in a cold dead end where no one would ever come across again. That's not to say I'm suicidal. I am *not*. I just like having those kinds of imaginations. The only thing I do to keep my mind off of these feelings these days is that I listen to music. Even my genres are New Age, or shoegazing or doom metal, which used to be uplifting epic music. Now I'm not going too much into that stuff, but I hope I've made my point clear. I'm not looking for concrete advice. Perhaps simply writing these down and sharing might help me a lot. Thank you for taking the time to read through this whole post. 
I truly appreciate it.","One thing I’ve noticed people don’t get, is we can depression even while having all our basic needs and shit.",2108,44,2020-04-15 03:13:13,g1jxci
depression,I feel like mental illness is the only medical condition where people wished they had cancer instead,"If I had cancer, I could say I needed time off work and everyone would be understanding. I could apply for and receive disability. 

I could freely tell my patients I was gone for 3 months or whatever bc I was doing chemo. 

No one would suggest that I dont need medicine bc Jesus died for my sins. 

I could be slow at work and my coworkers wouldn't think I'm lazy. They'd understand the physical toll cancer inflicts. 

People would rally around me. I could post about my journey on Facebook without shame. 

When I fall apart over small things people like to one up mentor tell me I dont have it bad at all. My health problems would be validated. 

Most importantly I wouldn't feel this terrible soul crushing desire to die.

Depression, Fear and anxiety everyday. Our country is run by corrupted politicians who ruled for 30 years. No one is able to let them go (they have weapons) ... 

I've been unemployed for more than 1 year. 
My father is unemployed too. 

We did a revolution that survived for 5 months but since corona happened it turned off and not one politician was convicted.

We are stuck in a war between Israel and Hezbollah. We are innocent educated people who speak 3 languages !!

My dad died two months ago and I can't deal with that I have to pretend he is still alive just to get through the day because if I'm reminded of it I cry and I can't stop.

When he died everyone flocked around my mum even though they hadn't been together for years, although they were still living together. No one comforted me. No one spoke to me.

My life on the outside is fine, I don't have any debt, bar my car payments have my own place-it's rented-but it's my own place I share it with my boyfriend who is great, I have a cat I have an awesome job as an estate agent that I love. I'm just so incredibly lonely and I was even before all the lock down and my dad dying. I just can never seem to be happy with anything.

I get gaslighted by my mum because of this she's a boomer and thinks millenials made up depression. 'all your generation are depressed, what do you have to be depressed about, you' re a mess your house is a mess' but then it stops me from getting help because I feel like if I ring the samaritans or other help I'm taking a spot away from someone who needs it.

I don't find the point in anything anymore I don't find enjoyment in anything I don't see a reason to clean up to eat to shower to exercise this has been worsened by the lockdown and working from home. 

My dad dying made it worse to the point where, when people die, life goes on, it feels like it shouldn't when I walked out of the ward in the hospital the hospital was still there there were people walking around the sun still set and rose I still had to go to work I still had to wake up in the morning and it all seemed wrong. 

But it makes me worried about my suicidal thoughts because a lot of people were upset that my dad died but they still carry on with their life, and that makes me think if I die, yeah my mum and my boyfriend would be upset but they would still carry on. Like I have to even though I don't want to. 

My dad suffered with depression he killed himself but not in a sudden way, he was an alcoholic he stopped eating and just drank alcohol and smoked himself to death. I think I get the depression from him. 

I don't smoke and I don't drink and I don't do drugs.

Edit: why did this post blow up this was just a depressive vent post

Edit 2: why is this being given wholesome awards reddit baffles me sometimes

Edit 3: I feel like I should add some context to my depression that may differ from your own experience. My depression mainly comes from a place of self-loathing  and my own inability to accept myself.

Had three more attempts, got better, got worse, and now as a 32 year old I'm here getting ready for my 5th run, hoping this one will be the last.  

It is not just a matter of ""things get better"", yeah things can get better, and they sometimes do, but sometimes they get worse and sometimes you are just tired of all of this, all this drudgery, all the daily hassle. The good can never offset the bad so is better punch out my card and leave this existence for those who really care about it.  

So try, if you can, stay alive, find meaning, find resolve, if not, there is at least the solace that everybody dies in the end. It may not be when we want, or when we need, but it will at least come one day.",2037,102,2020-11-24 08:26:45,k016wa

The only thing that stops me is my baby brother I take care of everyday. When he goes home though, I don't know. I just hope my mood is better by then.

And I can relate to still having those feelings.

Second of all, I hope that your mood will get better. Try to remember, that your brother, even when he goes back home, will still be here. And he will have times in life, where he could use a caring figure he has in you. I know how strong the suicidal urges can be, and I know how little to no reason there can be, for staying alive.

and if you have an issue with that or think it's funny or whatever, hey go fuck yourself.","My cat of 17 years passed about two years ago, and it broke my heart. I thank him for so much - he was there for me when no one in my life was. I thought his passing would break me - it hurt. But it made me want to make him proud, even though he’s a cat. It’s silly, but I definitely understand how you feel. I will grab his urn and talk to it sometimes. I was worried losing him would break me... but it didn’t.  He was gone, but the strength and love he put in my heart wasn’t. Cats are special. I’m glad you have a cat that loves you! One thing that keeps me going is thinking about how I will get another cat one day.

depression,"I think about suicide everyday, but I’m not planning it","Why does my brain constantly resort to wanting to kill myself? Every single day that’s my answer, I want to get it out of my head because I feel like if it continues for too long I may do something.
I have nothing planned, I just think about it all the time. Why is this?","I describe it to people this way:

Imagine that moment in life where you were in pain. I'm talking about excruciating, debilitating pain.  What's the only thing you want?

For the pain to stop.

Same thing applies for depression. Depression is the kind of pain you feel everywhere. It penetrates the mind. You feel it every day when you have to muster up what little strength you have just to get out of bed. Every time you feel regret, or the crushing feeling that your life is over at the tender age of 24. It crushes you.

But after spending years, potentially decades of this, it wears in you to the point where you just want the pain to stop. And because we're in so much pain, it's difficult to think straight. And the mind, operating off of instinct, thinks of the path of least resistance.  So we turn to cigarettes, alcohol, bad food, or whatever provides what little comforts we can find. This is morphine. It helps with the pain, but the pain is still there. After a while the comforts stop working and things get worse. And that's when the thoughts of suicide become much more appealing, then they're tempting, then irresistible...

To make the pain more manageable, it takes a lot of work. Think more like surgery, physical therapy and lifestyle changes. Now what work is needed to be done depends on the person. I can't make any recommendations because I don't know your situation. But I will say that it takes years of excruciating work for it to get better. I had to try multiple therapists, multiple psychologists and multiple changes to my life to get the ball rolling.  But if you stick with it and keep trying, things can improve. It's not a magic bullet, it takes work, but it's worth it in the end.",1984,48,2020-09-08 13:10:12,iot9f4
depression,Does anyone else feel like being depressed is just part of them? and its something that they will never be able to change about themselves or 'cure'?,"I literally cannot remember a time in my life where I wasn't angry or unhappy with myself or how people treated me. I've had body issues since I was 8 years old because my grandparents overfed me and let me eat sweets all day, which led to me being outcasted by my peers and constantly criticised by my parents. I first started thinking about suicide when I was maybe 12 or 13 and 10 years later I still think about it. I don't think I've ever has a solid year of my life where I've thought that everything was going to be okay and life was worth living. I've had months of temporary relief from the constant pain, but thats all they were; temporary. I thought finding someone to spend my life with and who loves me unconditionally and puts up with my suicidal tantrums would fix me but it hasn't. I thought effectively curing my disfiguring autoimmune disease would help me have a new lease on life, but it hasn't. I have lots of friends, an attractive face, and I had a job I liked. No body in my personal life except for two people know that I struggle, and the rest would never guess it. I have nothing to be sad about, really, I have an objectively easy life. But that doesn't matter, I am depressed and I always will be. I could have the perfect body, my dream job, have millions in my bank account and I'd still feel exhausted. In the same way that people say 'once an addict, always an addict', I've come to believe the same thing about my depression.","Hey dude, you're in an extremely similar situation to me. Been depressed and on/off suicidal since before the 1st grade. Now I'm in my 20s and things are worse if anything. I've got an easy, privileged life and I feel like I'm wasting it. However, my dad has also struggled with depression since he was in high school, so allow me to pass some of the advice I got from someone who's been depressed for 40+ years. Yeah, it might be a part of you. We don't have enough scientific knowledge about the brain to ""cure"" chronic mental illness. Chronic depression is basically just another form of disability, it's just invisible. The same way some people have asthma or bi-polar disorder, we have Major Depressive Disorder. We have to live our life with low levels of energy, huge struggles with motivation, self-image issues, and probably sleep issues too. At this point in my life I don't believe that will change. That means that you and I have to figure out a way to live as good of a life as possible while being depressed as shit. The only person who can actually affect your own brain is you. This doesn't mean I'm telling you to just ""deal with it"" or ""grow up"", quite the opposite. People with MDD are kind of living life on a harder difficulty than others. You gotta find ways to make things better, little by little. I find that I'm happier if I can get outside at least once a day. I feel better when I exercise, or eat a healthy meal, or talk to my friends. I think you just have to focus on doing as many of these things as possible, as often as possible. Is it easy? Fuck no, I've spent too many days sleeping for 18 hours or ignoring my responsibilities. But I have to recognize that that won't help me and my depression won't ever go away and it's possible yours won't either. Honestly that serves as some motivation for me, because it tells me exactly what I have to do to feel less depressed. You genuinely have to just improve your life. Find any opportunity to do it, get help from family, from friends. Go to the doctor and get some medication. Go to therapy. Have your friends keep you honest and let them encourage you to be healthy and hold you accountable when you aren't doing the things you should be. Vent when you have to. Understand that feelings of depression are natural and you aren't ""broken"" or wrong for feeling them. Making your life more livable is one of the hardest fucking things you can ask a depressed person to do, but it's genuinely the only option. If you're still alive at this point you probably understand that suicide isn't the option. You just have to keep trying, as painful as that sounds, I genuinely think that's the best way you can deal with this.

depression,Trying to succeed in college when you’re depressed fucking sucks.,"Everyone says “try harder” or “I know you can do it” and all I wanna say to them is shut the living fuck up.

No. The answer is always no. I've never once thought I'm glad I didn't do it. I've only ever regretted NOT doing it. If I had just acted on my first suicidal impulses or any of them after I'd have been so much better off. Not a thing has happened I should've cared about missing.

depression,I'm a 13 year old boy who is abused and need help,"I'm 13 years old and I live with my dad. I'm shared custody from my mom to my dad. My dad is very abusive towards me. I've been diagnosed with depression and PTSD and I've gone to the hospital twice over suicide attempts because every time I'm with my dad I want to kill myself. He pushes me to the limit and I'm afraid that. 

Ever since I was  little, my dad has always beaten me with a belt. Even before I was old enough for school. My dad has beaten me for not doing what I was told to do. He yells curse words at me and uses my mother as an example of what not to be. And that makes me feel sad because I miss my mom. Recently, my grades dropped. I've been having problems at school. I have a hard time focusing and paying attention to what I'm being taught. My dad was pissed. One moment he’s screaming at me and cursing me out and telling me I won't achieve anything in life. And telling me I'm going to regret it when he’s done with me.

My 11 year old brother also made a bad grade, so he walked into my brothers room and I heard screaming and loud sound from my dad hitting him with a belt. Then he walked up to me and told me to give him my hand. I held my hand out and he hit me extremely hard with the belt. I screamed and held my hand, but he told me to hold my hand out again he continue to do it over and over again.

Then he told both of us to come in the kitchen. He started yelling at us saying he was in an ""ass whooping mood"" and that he'd beat us whenever we felt like it. That if we didn't care about our grades he wouldn't care either. That he'd make us feel his pain. He hit me extremely hard. My hand was red and swollen. I had a bruise on my wrist that was slightly swollen and stung to the touch. He told me to hurry and wash the dishes before he'd do it again. And he did. But my hand hurt too badly. He threatened to hold me down.

I'm going to kill myself if I have to continue to live with him. I cannot take this anymore and no one will do anything about it, I decided that when I go back to my mom's on Sunday I am refusing to go back to my dad's. This is what it's come to because he refuses to cooperate and my mom doesn't have enough money to get a lawyer and free legal aid takes too long. So I am not going. I know my dad will call the police if I don't go. When they come, I will talk to them and tell them my situation.

Can they force me to go? What will they do? Because in order to get me to go they would have to physically drag me. I am in fear of my life and I don't want to die but he just pushes me to that limit so I just can't be around him. I don't know how many times I've tried to tell my dad this and even my therapists have tried to tell him this.

He doesn't care, he simply denies treating me the way he does saying he's never called me the things he does on a daily basis like dumbass, idiot, son of a b\*\*\*, and he even calls my brother those things and denies it. Then when we're in public or around other people he acts like a totally sweet person, and his girlfriend thinks that I'm the problem because he constantly complains about me when really it's just a big show.

What will the cops do about it when they come?","The cops will call child and family services and let them sort it out. Police deal with immediate problems, they don't sort out child welfare and custody situations.

Immediately after you or your brother are hit and the marks are fresh is the best time to call the cops. Sucks to wait for that obviously, but that's when you have physical evidence your story is true, if you can get your brother to corroborate your story of your dad's abusiveness that would also go a long way.",1880,89,2020-03-21 14:01:45,fmfemk

depression,23 F. I feel so behind Everyone. I feel like a 13 year old.,"I know I shouldnt complain at 23 But Ive struggled with depression since I was 13. Every year. For 10 years. I have few positive memories. Im tired and I dont want to do keep trying anymore. Everything ive tried never has worked. Meditation. CBT. Psychologists. Psychiatrists. Medication. Sleeping Pills. Weed.

I feel so young (because I havent literally done much at all with my depression+anxiety) but ancient at the same time. I have no passions, no interests. No goals. Havent had good friends in years. Virgin. I dont go out. I dont take photos, I dont use social media. I feel like I dont exist. I dont even have a fucking job now. Never had a boyfriend.

Literally the only thing Ive done is graduate university and I cant even get a fucking job.

Ive struggled in everything ive ever done. School. Hobbies. Uni. Work. Job Applications. Appearance.

The only time ive ever been hit on is at clubs. I just hate seeing other people my age succeed and do well in life. Even people who are 17-18, have had more experiences then me. I hardly go out. Ive spent 90% of time at home alone with my elderly parents. 

I try so hard, but Im still a loser and I hate it. Im not introverted and I just hate how my life has become. I hate it..I do. I feel like I must be such damaged goods that its too late to get better. These last 6 years in particular have flown and Im just so fucking done.

Its not like Ive tried. For 2 years Ive tried joining groups, volunteering etc to improve my situation but i get nowhere. No one wants a bar of me.

There is this little person jumping inside me wanting to live, but my brain and heart is just so done.","I'm 31 and I complain all the fucking time LMAO... Don't ever think that your age means that you shouldn't complain, as a matter of fact complaining is the soul reason we realize that we need a change in our lives. 

Think about the things that you do that do bring you even a shred of happiness. Once you have that list (even if it's only one thing) you list out the things you do on the regular that you feel bring you any kind of negativity. Once you have that list, you sort it out, give each negative thing a strict position on that list from biggest culprit to smallest. Now comes the hard part, change. 

By all means don't do this alone, if you need to talk to your parents. They can be the best tools to help put you in the right direction. You may even find that there's more things that you enjoy doing then you thought. Focus on those things, but don't depend on them, that's a good way to start hating doing that thing.

depression,I don’t want to kill myself but I don’t want to live.,"I’ve been feeling like this for about the past week or so now, and it’s been really bothering me. Ive been depressed for about a year or so and it’s getting worse. I don’t want to live, but I don’t want to die. I feel like I’m stuck in a quasisuicidal state.I keep having the thought of just pressing a button that would just instantly take me out of existence. I fantasize about being asleep forever. I feel like I haven’t been myself for years. I feel like I haven’t been able to think straight and I’m constantly worried about tons of shit, but I don’t have enough motivation to do anything. Does anyone feel the same way? It would be great to know if other people feel like this.

I’ve always struggled with depression over the years, but as of late it’s been increasingly high.

Im so tired. I’m so tired of existing. I’m so tired of being mad. I’m so tired of being tired. It’s pathetic. I’m a 25 year old adult who’s stuck living at home with my family. I can feel myself falling apart and I’m reaching the point where I’m finally just going to take myself out of this shitty game called life, or I’m going to end up cutting ties all together with my family, which is where I’ll probably sink. If it’s sink or swim out in the big world. 


I am holding on to so many grudges. From so many years. That I clearly can’t cope with in a healthy way. My heart hurts so much but I’m such a glutton for punishment that I can’t bring myself to stop carrying around all this hate. And it is absolutely one hundred percent consuming me alive. I’ll try and use brackets to section off my thoughts since I doubt anybody cares enough to actually read this all the way through. 



 {My thoughts on my father}

{{{{As an adult now. I realize that I spent probably the first 18 years of my life. Living in literal fear of my pseudo racist father. I still remember being 6 years old or so and hearing my mother scream for my brother because my father was choking her in their bedroom. Was a big steroid fan back in the day. I spent most of my middle school and high school career grounded from one semester to the next one because I frequently got C’s in school which my parents would ground us for. Even one C on the report card and it was grounded for the rest of the semester. I still remember getting in trouble so badly for lying about doing my homework, not even so much for not doing my homework. But it was distinctly about lying about it. My father was beating me in our dining room and at one point was physically choking me against the wall, and I remember my mother saying “well Don’t choke him (insert name)” and him looking straight at her with his hands around my neck saying “I’m not choking him” I still remember that same night him having to come in my room to change my ice packs on my swollen face and how petrified I was that the gameboy sp I was playing was flung off the bed in a room with no carpet because I was certain I was going to get beat again. I remember going to school the next and having to tell my teachers (because all six of them forced me to stay after class and talk about it) that I was playing football with my brother and fell on a sprinkler. Funny how their response to me lying about homework was to in turn go to school and lie about why half of my face was swollen and black. I remember the first time i was ever caught shoplifting (was obviously my last time doing it too) when my dad came to pick me up, he was already so nasty to me before leaving the store that the police threatened to not let me leave because he was already trying to hit me in front of them. 

But you know. Now that I’m an adult and have been jumped literally just because of my sexuality. If I’m going to get my ass beat I’m going to get my ass beat. I’m just not living in fear anymore. }}}}


 {my thoughts on my brother}

{{{{Which brings me to my brother. Who as of lately might as well be dead to me. We have not currently spoken since April, and as far as I’m concerned we probably won’t ever speak again. Let’s start with me saying I feel like my brothers relationship with me has always been from the start. Me bailing him out when he needs it. I remember being in elementary school and him getting to go back to sleep after my mother woke us up for breakfast and would leave for work, because it was my job to “wake him up after rugrats” when he was about 12 or 13 he got mixed up with a bad neighborhood kid and ended up almost lighting an entire house on fire in our neighborhood. The police officers were nice enough to offer him the deal that if you stay out of trouble until you’re 18 this will be completely removed off your record with no trace of it ever even happening. Sure enough he starts smoking weed in high school (which is back when it was HIGHLY frowned upon) and guess who had to take every single drug test for his four years of high school. My dumb ass. Bailing him out again. Until finally he got caught coming back late from lunch (upper class men were at the time allowed to leave campus for lunch) and he came back with a hotboxed car and didn’t air it out. So when the principle stopped him to ask why he was late she was literally hit with a cloud of smoke. My brother was the sole reason my high school was no longer allowed to leave campus for lunch. My brother and father have always had an awful relationship too obviously all this places even more tension on it, and eventually lead to him either being kicked out or leaving. I don’t remember which. Being on the streets on his own he was arrested more times for carrying stupid large amounts of weed on him because he sells it, and eventually got charged I think with robbery. Then to top it all off, a few years ago my brother got mixed up in the flocka epidemic. And of course there’s my dumbass bailing him out again being forced to put two stolen bikes in my car and drive him to Miami. 
When I first started realizing how much I hated him was I think my senior year of high school. My parents had gone out of town leaving him in charge. I remember distinctly it was the night before vans warped tour he’s in a huge fight with his at the time girlfriend, because he was literally hitting either her, or her and/or her kid. And I remember he stormed into my room flinging open the door trying to use me as an excuse “isn’t this okay because it’s what dad used to do to us. “ of course having a criminal record he couldn’t find a job and was on probation at my parents house and because nobody wanted to hire somebody with his record they literally gave him a fucking job at the company my father works for. This job is 15$ an hour, gets benefit and vacation days. I on the other hand spent years being treated like shit in jobs. Two years ago I worked for quiksilver over the course of about a year, finally left because they told me and a coworker that we were the ones being considered for management and yet they brought in two outside hires after the second one the other coworker had the sense to leave. My dumb ass stayed thinking well now that she’s gone it’ll look better on me. Which is when they brought in another outside hire. Who I was eventually cool with. I just stopped offering to do the management work for sales associate pay. Until I finally got so fed up that I transferred to GameStop because they were willing to start me as a keyholder since I already had basic management training. So two years trying to work for a manager only to be shit on by my parents because it’s not full time and “at your age your brother worked full time” at my age y’all gave him a fucking career because nobody wanted to hire a literal criminal. Anything I do It’s just never going to be good enough. 


Let me talk about our most recent altercation, because it’s a fantastic transition into my mother, as of last April I was unfortunately unemployed thanks to this whole virus outbreak, and of course that sets off my family members because I sleep all day while they work. So my mother asked me on April 20th the day before my birthday (a day that I was operating on approximately 2 hours of sleep because I’m always up all night) if I could go help my brother in the warehouse where he works because he really needs it.  I have already had altercations with my brother there from helping him a previous time. It was so bad that they sent me home early. So being there in general makes me uncomfortable. Even when I go in to help my dads department. So of course I didn’t want to help which wasn’t an acceptable answer to my mother and after about the 5th time of her saying something obviously I snapped and agreed to which she responded “forget it” and slammed my door shut. (It should be noted that in my mother’s defense I’m a nightmare to wake up because of how little I sleep. There are times I wake up and am in a fight with my mother because she apparently tried to wake me up and I was nasty, meanwhile I have literally no recollection of even speaking to her ) so my dumb ass trying to bite the bullet agrees to go work for eight hours in a hot sweaty warehouse with barely any ac on my birthday of all days. I woke up that morning still mad about the fight I had with my mother the day prior because I feel like as a grown ass adult I should be allowed to say no I don’t want to do something. 

Get to the warehouse work the shift, I leave at five, which apparently was a mistake because I wasnt supposed to leave until 5:30 which I thought was fine because 1) I genuinely thought they left at 5 every day and 2) I didn’t take a lunch break because I was hoping if we happened to get everything done early we would just be able to leave. Obviously that was wrong and I got a shitty passive aggressive text message from my brother.

Having already been in a bad mood from my fight with my mother the day before partnered with my brother annoying me after I had left I stopped by aunts house to vent because I was literally seeing red. Wasn’t even planning on going home for my birthday because I just didn’t want to be around any of them. 


The next day comes and I don’t show up because not only did I not want to be there, but when I had gotten there the day before another employee of that company said “we don’t know if we’ll need you tomorrow or not yet” so I just didn’t bother to show up because if y’all needed me you should have worked that into your text message when you were being an asshole in my opinion. So of course my petty ass isn’t going to show up.  My brother comes home through the door doesn’t even put his shit down and is in my face screaming at me for not showing up “why should I have to explain to my boss why you didn’t come” “why do you get to sleep all day while we work I’m sick of it” turning to my mother “I’m sick of him aren’t y’all sick of him” (to which she agrees probably just trying to get him to calm down, but I won’t ever for a second forget you just said you were sick of me. ) and of course I’m running my mouth back in return, which is when he decided to put his hands on me, shoving me literally to the floor. And this is about where I Black out with anger because I had my Nintendo switch in my hand. The limited edition no longer in production animal crossing themed one at that. So obviously I’m pissed and yank his PlayStation out of the wall and slam it on the ground. You can skip the next parentheses part if you don’t care about why a stupid video game console made me so upset.

(A detour to mention about these video game consoles. My brother and I used to exclusively use Xbox but I made the transition to the PS4 when it came out. My brother didn’t. I had been asking for a PlayStation 4 since they came out for both my birthday and Christmas for I think like two years. Until the year my brother spent Christmas in jail because he was addicted to flocka. When my mom finally bailed him out because she felt like he was actually clean, he got a PlayStation 4. When I asked why he got one and I didn’t despite it literally being the only thing I asked for as a Christmas gift, she said “well he wasn’t here for Christmas so I had to make it special.” I think I eventually got the PlayStation for my birthday the following year. But this fucking switch man. I swore up and down when I was a GameStop employee that they were going to make an animal crossing version and they all laughed at me said if it was going to happen it would have already and talked me into buying just a standard switch instead. Low and behold a few weeks later the animal crossing one is announced and I’m lowkey heartbroken that I just spent a majority of my money on the standard one. I eventually get myself so worked up over it that I asked my mom to front me the money to buy the new system, and I will give her 200 when I sell my switch and the rest from my next paycheck. She’s talking some I can’t I don’t have that kind of money, which would have been totally fine. I was just embarrassed that I not only put my pride away to ask for money, but was also upset enough about not getting the animal crossing one to even be in this situation. So whatever whatever we end up agreeing on if I sell the console first and give her the two hundred she will give me the rest. Where as I was only asking her for the front because I didn’t want to risk selling my console before the new one came out and risk then not having a console at all. Especially since I had already missed like two years of the switches lifespan.  So obviously I’m super thankful to my mom and I literally spent like two days thanking her and talking to her about it, only for me to find out that she had given me my own money. I don’t know what it was for, possibly my unemployment since the console came out around the time the virus was starting to flare. And at that point all I can keep thinking is wow. You really kept my own money from me, made me gamble on being able to find a limited edition console without a preorder. And told me you couldn’t loan me anything. That makes me so mad. How are you going to lie about my own damn money. Serves me right I guess for not being adult enough to stop using our joint bank account.) 

Anyway. I slam his PlayStation on the ground after he put his hand on me the first time we get into a screaming match in his room to which I say something along the lines of “you’re allowed to knock my switch out of my hand so why should you expect any different of your PlayStation” to which he responds (talking out of his ass) “well you didn’t pay for it mom did!” Jokes on you asshole not only did I pay for it entirely with my money but our mother literally withheld my own money from me and made it more difficult for me to get an already difficult to get console. This ends up with him coming back into my room because everyone in my family (myself included) has to have the last word in argument. Which leads to him putting his hands on me a second time except this time since there’s not a 400$ gaming system in my hand I pull his disgusting ass down with me.}}}}}

This whole fight somehow ends with me being kicked out of my house by my mother. 

 {my thoughts on my mother}

{{{{Fun fact. Maybe about a week before this my mother was begging me to stop going out despite taking precautions with a mask and specially made sanitizer consisting of primarily alcohol. Because they had a friend in critical condition from covid. This is the same woman who threw her kid out into streets during the first peak of this epidemic. (I’m in Florida so it is at this moment higher than that first peak because Floridians are trash) so I spend the next three or four day sleeping in my car doing whatever trying to manage on my own, spending what little money I had fixing the joycon drift on my switch that was non existent until my brother attacked me with it in my hand. One thing leads to another and I eventually end up back home. I asked my mom if we could start family therapy because I’m literally holding onto grudges that I don’t know how to let go of. She says when all of this is over but I’m positive she’s forgotten about it and it might very well be what causes me to cut her out all together. 

A few days ago me and my mother got into a huge arguement because she woke me up to ask me to take her to firestone to pick up her car(I’m exhausted but totally not a problem to me at all) so I get right up get dressed grab my keys and when I walk out of my room she goes “are you ready now I’m not in a rush or anything” I was a little annoyed by the stupid question I’ll admit, like you just two minutes ago came into my room to wake me up and ask me to take you. Yes I’m ready to go lol. Otherwise I’d still be asleep. She of course takes my flat response (a slight mixture of both my annoyance and exhaustion) as me being in a bad mood. So we get into my car and she’s overreacting because my car is a little shaky (which I’m almost positive is just because I need air in my tires) talking some oh my god we have to pull over what if you have a flat. Like we definitely would know if we were driving on a flat tire. It’s been doing this since like the second week I got this car. So I’m just sitting there trying to get to the destination as fast as possible trying to hold my tongue and not cause a fight when she sets me off and says something along the lines of “you’re in a bad mood because I asked you to take me” my response being “oh what I’m in a bad mood because I got right up to do something you asked me to do???” which fucking infuriated me and caused a screaming match in my car. I don’t understand why she has this god complex where she thinks she gets to tell other people how they feel about something. She did it to me on my birthday too which I forgot to mention and am now too lazy to go back and add in. But like it drives me crazy. I don’t care if they’re right wrong or somewhere in between. Nobody has the right to decide how somebody feels about something except for that person. So when I sit there and tell you I’m not mad and you tell me “yes you are mad that’s why you’re being shitty” that’s a self fulfilling prophecy right there. Of course that shits going to make me mad. If you’re just going to decide I’m in a bad mood for me then shit I guess I’m in a bad fucking mood then. 

So this screaming match in my car leads to her saying “I hope something happens to your car, and when it does DONT call me”. I will never ever in a million years forget she said that to me. I hope that when something does happen to my car, I’m inside of it, I hope it’s something fatal, and I hope she has to live with it for the rest of her life. And then of course after our screaming match she sends me a passive aggressive text message (because apparently my family is famous for doing that shit) talking some I won’t be screamed at in a car that I bought you, you are SO disrespectful the next time you talk to me like that you can find a new place to live! (As if she didn’t kick me out when I was 16, and 18, and 23. Like clearly I can manage in my car bitch try me. I would rather starve to death on the streets than feel like I need help from someone who treats me like shit) Skip the parentheses if you don’t care about context with my car history

(Both me and my brother were fortunate enough to get cars for our 16th birthday. The difference between us is my brother has wrecked I think 2 cars my parents bought him, one car they gave him because my mom got a new car (which that one he wasn’t at fault for but still it’s a car to add to your tally) and ruined one of my dads trucks that he was using for whatever reason one day.  I on the other hand drove the same car that I had since I was 16 until literally this year when I turned 25 and was given a new one. But honestly my parents had been trying to buy me another one for a few years I just fought them on it because I didn’t want a new car which I will explain why later. )

And then now just today, we are in another arguement because I think last night, my brother walked out our back gate to go sell drugs in our mailbox because he thinks he’s cool and tough and can handle jail as if he isn’t literally crying “mommy bail me out” when he’s in there. As he’s going out he knocks over the ashtray I had been using over there (which was admittedly in the walkway but only because that particular night I was in a hurry to relocate under my backyard awning because it was raining and I had all my technology on me) but when he walks back he has the nerve to say to me “your ashtray is knocked over “ as if i wasn’t outside and heard him kick it over like I’m supposed to lean up after him. Despite us having literally not a said a word to eachother since April. So I hid the ashtray that he normally uses with the mindset of “if he needs an ashtray he’ll have to go over and clean up the one he kicked over.” Only for me to find that my mother ended up being the one to clean up his mess. Which of course infuriated me. And then she had the nerve to defend him in a text message after we got into an arguement about it. “Well it is your ashtray...” okay did I kick over my ashtray or did my brother. Because that’s the person who should have cleaned it up was who knocked it over. 

In regards to my mother specifically it hurts me the most. Because I often at times feels like she’s the only one out of the 3 of my immediately family that I could have a relationship with or that I actively want to have a relationship with and that bridge is so close to being burnt to a crips. I don’t want to appear ungrateful because as a mother she does go above and beyond. I’ve been spoiled sure. But my problem with it is, I feel like my mother only gives as much as she gives so that she has ammunition to hold over peoples head. I fought her for YEARS about getting a new because I knew she would just hold it over my head. Which obviously I was right about. I remember being kicked out when I was 18 because I wasn’t working and i had just gotten kicked out of college and she said leave your keys pack your stuff and find somewhere to live. So I did set off with no car no money no nothing ended up being taken in by my best friends family. Spent a year or two there, and I literally did not get my car back (the same one she had given me at 16) until the girl I was living with literally called her in tears asking if we could just borrow it so we could go see her mother who was in the hospital because she needed brain surgery. LITERAL BRAIN SURGERY was the only reason I got my car back. And it still took my friend like two or three times of asking my mother for her to let me use my car just to take her to see her mother. 

My father has always babied me and let me get away with more than he lets my brother get away with I can admit that. The problem with it is, that because I don’t feel the same type of yearning for a relationship about my father that I do about my mother I don’t really care about him favoring me. And because my dad tends to let me get away with more my mom feels like she has to let my brother get away with more, which in turn causes me to always just feel like I’m chasing my mother’s approval or some shit. }}}}



 {thoughts on my own disgusting self}

It’s only been recently that I’m starting to come around to my father and that’s only because I think I’m starting to hate my mother. 


I know I probably sound ungrateful and entitled. And I can see why. But I am truly thankful for how privilege I’ve been and all that I’ve been given. But I don’t know how to not feel the way that I feel about these things. 


And that’s not to say I’m perfect either. I’ve caused plenty of problem for my family. So let me just skip to all my flaws now. 

When I was a kid like before I could even start kindergarten I was literally already sucking dick. My next door neighbor ( my brothers age at the time) used to make me do it to him and I used to agree because he was considerably nicer to me when I do would so. He was already a problem child too but that’s neither here nor there. I was pretty much only sucking him off because my brother always hated when I would hang out with him and his friends, and the neighbor always let me hang around (for obvious reasons) distinctly remember my brother catching us a few times but I guess nothing was ever done about it. Not even sure if my parents know about it. 

But as an adult I can see that’s where I started getting fucked up. Idk if I necessarily blame my neighbor for me being gay, because I do firmly as a gay man believe that it’s just who you are and can’t be changed, but I feel like there will literally always be a part of me that questions it. Like what if I wasn’t sucking dick at five years old, would I be interested in girls? I remember having a crush on at least two different girls before i met (what I now as an adult realize was probably my first boy crush) like looking back on my child hood I vividly remember playing “doctor” with other kids or truth or dare that always ended sexual and I realize like damn. That’s fucking gross we were all kids. 


Fast forward to me being in I think middle school, and I was caught sexually experimenting with my cousin. I was definitely old enough to know better so I take fault there, but I also wasn’t ever the one initiating it. You know. I was letting him suck me off for longer than I can remember honestly, but I also distinctly remember I wasn’t the one initiating it. I still remember the first night at his house when he asked me to go pornhub and grilling him about how he even knows about that. I don’t remember when I started letting him do stuff to me, but I know that I shouldn’t have. I remember well enough that when he would come sleepover there were times I would opt to stay up late with my father in hopes that he would fall asleep waiting for me to come in. I remember one time I was up late and he comes walking out like 2 hours after being put to bed because he was trying to get me to come in to bed with him. But again I was the older kid in that situation. So that’s my fuck up. Obviously when we got caught it put a wedge between that side of our family. I can see why, but in hindsight I always wonder. Would you have still distanced yourself if you knew it was your son who had been initiating it? Because he was younger all the blame was pushed onto me. And I can see why. Again I should have known better. 

That’s probably around the time I started getting fat. By high school at one point I was over 300 pounds and openly gay. Never had a serious relationship. Never even had someone interested in a relationship with me. I can see why. Not only was I cringey in high school but I was literally disgusting. It wasn’t till about my senior year I finally got back under 300 pounds and started losing some weight and gaining some confidence. 

But here’s the kicker. Before I started losing the weight I had become a literal serial catfisher. And I’m talking like anybody you wanted to see naked I would go out of my way to target. Friends, friends boyfriends. Nobody was off limits to me. It makes me sick thinking about the hundreds of people I’ve catfished because I was horny and lonely. Catfishing even basically got me kicked out of my college ( granted I was surprisingly innocent at that time but because the kid found out about me being a catfish he refused to believe it wasn’t me, despite me literally having to show my catfish accounts to the dean and them not matching up to whoever he was talking to. The college only realized their mistake a semester or two later because the kid was immediately put on academic probation the semester following my suspension, and then got caught trying to do the same thing to another gay student the semester after that. Which is when they were like wow we were wrong we’re so sorry don’t even worry about the requirements we gave you for coming back you can just come back never did though.) 

It wasn’t only until I hit maybe 22 or 23 that it like clicked with how awful what I was doing was. And started making an active effort to stop it. And I feel like I was only even willing to because I fell in genuine love with somebody I was catfishing. When I finally told him, we were fine for a few days. He told me he didn’t care that I was a guy because he fell in love with the person behind a screen. But all of that quickly crumbled to ashes. That’s another one that’s my own fault. Not only was I doing something shitty but I was also in too deep. I think I still to this day get texted from somebody I started catfishing when I was about 15 or 16 that I just am too afraid to finally tell the truth to. 

But since the recent heart break I’ve thankfully been able to almost entirely remove catfishing from life save for the one guy I was in too deep with, and the old catfish accounts that I occasionally log into when I’m desperately alone/horny/whatever it may be. 

I’m tired of feeling alone. I just want to be loved. I want someone to want me. To care about me.

I’m starting to realize this world is awful. Almost every thing and everyone in it is bleak. Some people genuinely want to live long happy lives, me personally, I don’t think I can make it doing this shit for another 25 years. Self deprecating jokes and suicidal humor are my biggest weapons. Because I feel like if I don’t turn them into jokes. I’ll let them overcome me. Too many people in this world are awful. I don’t want to be one anymore. 


I doubt any of you will actually care enough to read this through. But if you for some unknown reason did, then I thank you. Because I could really use a friend. 



TLDR; I’m a scumbag. I’m starting to think my family is scumbags, and I’m genuinely losing my will to live. I’ve been holding on to grudges that are literally consuming me and transforming me into a being of hatred and it makes me sick to my stomach. I don’t know how much longer I can do this, but god I would absolutely love to just be taken out by a bus tomorrow.","I am at a point in my life where you are right now, my friend... I'm 19 and I am just tired. Tired of everything. Emotionally worn out and no longer feel like I should follow my heart... But know that you are not alone.

depression,My sister saved my life yesterday.,"There I was minutes away from grabbing my gun, about to walk in the woods and end it. Was actually starting to feel pretty good about that too. Not having to hate myself, going through life everyday while nothing seems to make me happy anymore. Then my younger sister gave me a rock she painted for me. Blue with a guitar on it, and a moon with stars in the middle of the guitar. It said made in 2020, Love Nikole. I almost cried in front of her which is something she's never seen me do. It just hit me so hard, like beyond words. My family is very loving but they mostly keep to themselves. I just thought to myself, how could I put her and everyone else through such a thing. Spent half the night crying like a little girl, I'm 34M. Still woke up feeling like garbage, but I dunno somethings different, I guess that feeling like someone's thinking of me is helping a bit. I can't say anything to her now but in the future I'm really gonna thank her for that. I still feel like I don't wanna be here, but whereas before it was 100%, now I'm slightly on the fence about it. Hopefully this is a little inspiration for those out there thinking like me. I should probably reach out to her but things like that are so hard for me, plus then the whole family would know.

depression,Depression turns me into a bitter self-destructive asshole w no empathy,"It’s such a toxic downward spiral. My depression manifests itself as chronic indifference, loss of interest in doing anything, no hope/purpose in life, and the general malaise causes me to, perhaps worst of all, turn into a bitter, insufferable asshole. Everything and everyone bothers me to a much stronger degree. I become increasingly judgemental and dismissive of others. I lash out and hurt those close to me when I need them most. It’s like I’m a completely different person; everything sucks, everyone sucks, and I don’t want to deal with any of it. 

It’s incredibly destructive but I honestly can’t help myself, as I’m too depressed to even maintain a conversation and feign interest or empathy in anyone to begin with. I used to be so charismatic, but trying to rekindle that energy again just makes me come off as janky and contrived. Again, I’m like a completely different person.

Similarly, grooming does not seem worth it at all unless I have to go somewhere (and even then, sometimes I just put a hat on and call it a day). I just wish my brain would reward me with happy chemicals for getting shit done, the way it's supposed to, because it feels like every day I just wake up and wait for the day to be over already.","Delayed gratification?

depression,Can someone read this ? It’s my full story,"If I can have at least one person read this, it would make me feel really happy because someone can get the full picture of my life.

I’m a black 17M in high-school who lives in the USA. My interests fall in computer science, math, video games, and anime/manga. When I was younger I loved video games so much, and I still do to this day. Video games were the reason I was planning to work at a game development studio in the future. I felt more understood by VG’s than I did with my family. 

I’m not close with my family and I don’t ever will be because they are toxic af. I’ve been psychologically abused and nobody would ever listen to my end of the story. They are the major cause for my depression, and some for my suicidal tendencies. As more time passed I would stay in my room as much as I can because I whenever I would step out, my parents would drag with them to some store, usually insult me, or whine about how lazy I am. My mom has been more abusive, but at the same time she is an idiot who I was able fool on a few occasions. My dad is annoying and racist. For some ungodly reason he hates white people, which makes me embarrassed to have him as a father. My stepmom is stupid and racist so I can’t stand her. Certainly least, my sister is a literal bitch, who has no regard for anyone’s feelings. 

School is the worst thing to have ever happened to me. I don’t even know where to begin with school because I have had so much shitty stuff happen to me. Elementary school was ok. I was easy target for harassment, but it’s not as bad as it was in middle school. When I was in elementary school, I never saw the importance of school. I barely did any work, and never bothered to pay attention in class. Almost everyday in elementary school, I just looked forward to going home and playing on my Nintendo DS. It was my major motivation back then.

Then came middle school. This is where so many problems came to rise. Words cannot describe how horrible my middle school experience was. This is when school pressure really started hitting me and that I felt the need to work harder. I had only like one friend in the beginning of 6 grade, and by then I began getting bullied by having that friend. This friend of mine was seen as very strange and weird by every other student, but I defended him and decided to go through constant harassment so I can keep being his friend. One day at the end of the year, my science teacher decided to expose me In front of the class because she got so sick of me not turning my work. I don’t blame her though lol. Next is 7th grade where there was no end to bullying. Throughout the school year, I tried so hard to fit in and be like everyone else, but it really backfired making me look more like an idiot. I would do the most retarted shit just for attention because I felt so lonely. Worst idea ever. Now those memories are stuck with the other students who went to class with me. I asked I crush out and she rejected me (wasn’t much a big deal, but I did feel pretty embarrassed after). Almost all my friends were fake, and would easily turn their back on me. Whenever I was alone, thoughts of self harm would become more frequent, and whenever I wasn’t I was being harassed by someone. The last day of 7th grade is literally the worst day of my life. Completely lonely the first half, then, midday, I accidentally fell in some chalk that was on the concrete, and it ruined the clothes I was wearing that day. My “friend” saw this as the perfect opportunity to embarrass me in front of much other students as he can. Almost immediately when he found out, he literally started running around the school and tried to tell almost anyone nearby about how dumb I looked with chalk on my clothes. Students nearly when they saw me just gave a weird look or an expression of confusion. I was so suicidal that day. Next is 8th grade. Not as terrible as 7th, but still bad. I was admitted into a 9th grade biology class because of my great grades in 7th grade environmental science, but the biology class was horrible to be in. The teacher was absolute shit, and made it harder for us just for the sake of it. When I came in that class on the first day, I almost had a heart attack because there were so many students who were admitted in this class and I knew none of them. Some of the other students I sat with hated me because I got some of the concepts confusing. Insert some more embarrassing moments then you have 8th grade. High school is better then middle school, but I still hate school in general. 9th grade: I’ve never been so lonely. 10th grade: My existential crisis began. 11th grade: suicide attempts. 12: burnout and more suicide attempts. I don’t want to treat life as a separate entity, but 2020 killed me this year. I wish I can just take a mental break, but my parents are denying my depressive symptoms. Doing schoolwork has never been so difficult holy shit. If I can’t even do it well in high school, then how can I do it college ? 

Life is so horrible. I get abused for the most minor things and I don’t know what to do anymore. I have no idea what to do for the future because I ruined my grades and I’ve overthought what I want to be when I grow up. I attempted suicide like over 10 times this year, but none of them work. I don’t understand why people just won’t help me, even when I reach out. I wish my life just ended by whatever means. I don’t to be homeless especially at this because it’s insanely cold outside. My point is everything is just not fucking fair. I actively try do the most I can to rid depression and do my schoolwork, but nobody will fucking cooperate with me. Even when I’m having my best day, I still always contemplate on suicide as if it’s the “answer” to my life. I low key wish someone would hug me

depression,I'm not going to kill myself but everyday I feel like dying,"Every single day I feel like I want to die.

I'm tired of feeling useless and having no real talents.

My drive to achieve any goals has faded.

A part of me doesn't  want to care about being successful

The rat race is driving me crazy.

I've been fired from almost every job I've had.

Even the job I had with someone in my family.

They told me I had too many mental problems.

Everyday I watch my family go to jobs they hate and spend most of their free time sleeping.

I have mental problems that keep me locked in the house.

I'm mostly introverted and I try to enjoy my own company.

Everyone I ever meet has never tried to keep in touch with me.

When speaking online to people I'm ignored most of the time.

So I stay quiet because I already know the outcome.

My councilor has missed two of the meeting we were suppose to have.

Acting like they didn't know they had an appointment.

If anyone read this I will be surprised.

God please help me !

depression,Happiness really is a privilege,"Growing up I never thought about it like that. I always thought happiness was just something everyone eventually had and that it was just the norm, and that anyone who wasn’t happy was some outcast. Now I see happiness really is a privilege, and I don’t say this in spite. If you are happy, that’s amazing, but also I think there are a lot of people who don’t realize how lucky they are to be happy. It truly boggles my mind that there are people who go to bed excited for the next day, it’s a feeling I don’t think I can remember having, at least for a very very long time.","Agreed.. they say it is all about the attitude, but when you are struggling at a depth this low, it sounds like a personal insult.

Edit: So many beautiful comments. Thank you all for sharing. I love this community as it's very insightful and you don't quite feel as alone as you may think you are.","I know how you feel, but here is one very important thing I feel like most people forget when they feel they’ve fallen into depression. And I’ve felt this a lot myself, we always feel like what we once had is lost.  But that isn’t true, I don’t believe your creativity is lost, rather you mind is running at a million miles per house because of everything depression makes you think of so your creativity has taken a back seat, but that doesn’t mean it’s gone, simply suppressed, it is simply lying dormant inside you waiting for the day where you finally find enough strength to block out all the depressive thoughts and dig through your brain until you find the creativity all the way in the back seat.  It’s hard I know, I find I’ve lost parts of myself to depression to, but after years of digging I’ve refound those parts of myself.  It’s hard to get pass all the voices and the thoughts because yeah we always just feel too weak to even try, but the best thing you can tell yourself is to have hope because like I said, your creativity isn’t gone, it’s just waiting for the day that it doesn’t take the backseat behind your depression, and when that day comes you’ll be so happy I just know it.  Don’t be too hard on yourself though, you aren’t alone in experiencing this, when depression and depressive thoughts are the forefront of your mind it’s easy to feel like you did something wrong when your abilities become dormant but realize you never chose depression, it chose you as it’s host and that will never be your fault. So just have faith and continue to work slowly and take baby steps to unlocking that dormant ability, I know it’s there.

depression,"I hate it so much when you try and express your feelings to your parents, but they turn it around and compare your suffering with theirs.","I've been feeling really depressed and lonely lately from my job, I'm a full time late night janitor for a courthouse just 10 miles away from my hometown. Working there has been pretty easy, but I wound up feeling super lonely a lot considering I don't really get to talk to my friends or hang out with them much.

So just today I came home late as usual, and I have a little interaction with my mom after she made a joke to me that I took pretty personal and felts like was more of an insult rather than a sense of humor. I told her that I didn't really want to joke around like that, but she refused to listen and told me to just go away then. Despite attempting to change the topic and explain why I haven't been feeling so high, all she kept doing was telling what a great mom she is for raising me and my brother while struggling to make ends meet and keep the house. What an ungrateful little bastard I am for not appreciating her hard work and sacrifices. 

At that moment I was legitimately about to begin to cry. But rather instead of pausing and trying to reverse the damages, all my mom did was host a little parental style of the oppression Olympics and proclaim her amount of tears and cries over the course of three weeks. I got out just before my first tear would legitimately run down my cheek. 

And even before I went to bed, she goes on about how her life is more worse than ours, then escalates into a more ""This is why you'd make a terrible mistake getting behind the wheel"" considering I had practice driving this morning. Unaware that she had just lite the fuse to trigger the firework, but she didn't seem to care.

When we are hurting or down we need people to listen and be sympathetic, not turn it around on themselves. 

Many parents can only handle these situations by bringing it back to what they can relate to. 

They are trying but can’t see it from your side. Maybe explain to them what you want them to do. Listen and say, “I am sorry”",1761,50,2020-03-06 14:04:15,fedwbi

It's been a while since that happened. The bell rang and the break began. So I went to find them and when I did they were laughing so hard (I was in my very lows that day), I felt so nice for them and at the same time I thought ""I can't offer them that"". Before we went back to the classes, I let them walk infront of me because I didn't feel like being 100% in the mood and just by looking at them I kept thinking how great they are together.
Now today I saw some Insta stories of them staying at the house of the one I am closest to and it kinda hit me again. I hope I am not just jealous. It's just that at points I feel like I annoy them when they give me no reason to believe that.

I always tell jokes and laugh and 90% of the time they won't even notice the state of me because of how well I hide it. I love them, yet I am sure they deserve someone who is not like me.  Especially the one I am or used to (yes I am insecure) be closest to. She deserves the world and she's always been there for me but I can't keep being a burden to someone so kind, whom I love so much. I just feel like they ""clicked"" so much better and even though on one hand it kinda hurts on the other it is nice to see them like that.

depression,Don't promise a mentally ill person that you'll never leave them.,"It's just fucking cruel.

I first had a best friend who did this, in all fairness it was my fault our relationship downhill but even during that she insisted she'd still be there for me, yet when I eventually decide to try take up the offer to reconnect I'm ghosted.

Then my boyfriend promised me he'd never leave me throughout the 8 months we were together but then he dumps me out of the blue , the half assed stuff he did tell me was likely just because he thought id fucking kill myself if he was truthful. He said he still wants to be there for me but has yet to give off even a sense that he cares, I wouldn't be suprised if he got with the girl he almost cheated on me with right after dumping me.

My point is, never make a promise like this to someone who you know is vulnerable. You KNOW they'll most likely use you as a pillar for support and when you promise them that you'll never leave you give them false hope that crashes down on them twice as hard because of that promise. It's just a fucking cruel thing to do.","
So many times it's self destructive. We hear people say that they'll never leave us, then we push them and push them and we self destruct and we don't get professional help and we don't help ourselves and they bare the brunt of this illness which is in some weird way is directed at them now. You never really believed they would be there forever we believe eventually everyone will leave us and break their prosmise and hurt us more - but we don't see how we are treating and pushing away the other person. Everyone has their limits even if they do care about you. And when someone says this we have a tendency to test them on this. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is that this can be self manifested.

depression,ever look back on your life and just wonder what happened to you?,"i used to be so outgoing and carefree. i was content with myself because i didnt really have the capacity at that point to dislike myself at all - like, i didnt really know what that was, and i hadn't really lived much of life at that point to have developed anxiety and other issues. i didnt overanalyse and overthink. i actually used to walk about without this constant pit feeling in my stomach and without anxiety filling up my chest all the time. i genuinely used to be fine, and now im not so much. if i sit for a while and actually, genuinely think about how i physically and emotionally felt and think about my past perception of the world it is so different from how i feel now. and occasionally i'll get a fleeting feeling that reminds me of the contentedness i had when i was younger but it never stays. and it makes me so sad

depression,"Whether I live or die, the world will remain unaffected.","I won't be missed by more than the two people who I depend on.

People will continue to justify life's arbitrary and meaningless cruelty with fantastical explanations. They will continue to center their lives around those fantastical explanations.

By chance of birth, some people will continue to live great lives and others will continue to suffer. The lucky ones will go through life engaged and curious, and the rest will gradually be beaten down by rigidity, conformity, or cruelty.

The endless, toxic, and useless discourse that has come to define online life will not cease.

The universe's countdown to extinction won't stop.

Babies will continue to be born into abuse, never having a chance.

People will continue falling in love, every kiss taunting my lonely time on this Earth. 

In an effort to fight against meaningless absurdity, people will continue to hate and wage war.

Billions of farm animals will continue being bred into existence, with all their capacity to feel pain and terror intact, only to live cramped and miserable lives that end in systematic slaughter.

Romantics will continue to write music and poetry in an attempt to offset the suffering that has come before them and will continue to come after.

I can't take this anymore. We were all born into hell. The lucky ones are the ones who are naive enough to roll their eyes at the preceding sentence. I can't believe I was born with the capacity to feel so much, only to be burned and tortured for such a long time as to only have the negative feelings left intact. I can't believe someone with so many hopes and dreams has no grace bestowed upon him, only the same oblivion that everyone is forced to face sooner or later.

I can't do this anymore. I want to scream but no one will listen. I can't believe the level of helpless agony that so many of us are forced to endure. Why. Just fucking why. I haven't felt loved and safe in 10 years, since I was 17. That's not an exaggeration. I can't fucking believe this is my life.

depression,If you told me I had five minutes left to live I’d be relieved.,"Posting this from my second account. 

This year has been the worst of my (26 F)  life. 

My dad died a month ago today due to a pulmonary embolism. I’m devastated. I also had my fourth miscarriage earlier this year and my fiancé left me after cheating on me the whole relationship. 
I’m in school to be a teacher and due to dads death it isn’t going well. 

I’ve stopped talking to friends and told them I’ll talk to them after Christmas. I don’t feel like pretending to be fine to appease them. 

I’ve stopped eating healthy and lost all this weight very rapidly. 

I don’t sleep. I stay up late and wake up early. 

I feel like everyone hates me and I’m a failure. I also feel terribly lonely. I just don’t see light at the end of the tunnel and I’m in a lot of pain. 

I’m not suicidal but if you told me I only had a few minutes left to live I’d be very relieved and I’d go as far to say... joyful.

My first three pregnancies were conceived in an abusive relationship non-consensually between 16-19. This time was very much different and fiancé was long gone by time I found out but I was happy my parents and I were happy.

depression,"You can't kill yourself, think of your family!","Yup, no shit. Every time I would ever come out as suicidal, that's always the first thing they say. The crutch for my existence is reliant on others wanting me to struggle in the same foggy waters that I've been struggling in for years. I know they're trying to help, but it doesn't help, it just guilts me into a corner and leaves me being perpetually sad all the time. It leaves me with the impression that if I sever ties with everyone to the point where I am, in their eyes, irredeemable garbage, that maybe I'll finally be free from my death causing pain to others. At least that was my impression before I realized the hard way that it would only shift the pain from my death to my actions. So even if I get lucky, and my suicide was clean, It will never be painless. So, for now I'm trapped, there is simply no solution other than think about wanting to die and feeling selfish right after.

Edit: I sympathize for the people in this thread who's parents are part of the problem.  That makes this statement much, much worse. The people trying to help are effectively assuming that you have the same loving parents and probably tell you things about their parents you would kill to have for one day. That sounds like a rusted knife to the chest, and I'm sorry you have to deal with that. To people with worthless, unsupportiave parents, I hope you can get out of that situation as soon as possible and find a support group.

depression,"Do you also feel like this, totally neutral and absolutely bored with life, feeling that nothing has real substance and colour ?"," 

Hello folks, I feel a certain way since years and I try to muffle it as hard as I can but it's getting impossible and I wanna know if you feel like this too, or what is it.

I've always found interest in quite everything and i've tried to do everything around me that I was actually able to (psychologically or physically speaking).  
But I can't get invested in anything I do. Any activities that I do are short and if they go on for too long I get bored.  
I force myself to do quite everythings, I force myself to feel emotions (like happiness when I get a gift or happiness when I win on games) and the only emotions that are spontaneous and ""real"" from me are frustration and absolute void.  
When I don't force myself to live emotions out of peer pressure, I feel absolutely neutral and quite sad about life.  
Everything seems washed out and boring, literally everything.  
Nothing stimulates me or give me a feeling of pleasure or joy.  
Nothing really interests me and I feel like i've done everything that I HAD to do in my life and I only see one option now : that it's over !  
(I don't wanna suicide even if sometimes I think about it, I won't do it because I don't want to but it just feels like life is meaningless now and it's the only logical choice)  
I got the checklist done, everything else is purely boring and non stimulating, so I don't really wanna live anymore.  
Because literally everything that I do makes me suffer, even writing this text.  
Because I feel like it's useless and boring.

Is that just depression in a way ?","Yes, depression takes the love out of everything and it feels like I've been rubbed down in anaesthetic paste but also been given a sensitive serum, everything feels so dull, even the physical pleasures but exercising or working out hurts. It's like something broke inside me and I can't feel joy or excitement but I ache. I ache for my friends and family when they see me like this and I know I love them, but I can't get excited when they make plans with me, or feel joy when I need them.

depression,My dad told me stop being depressed because it's embarrassing him.,"Last year On November 21 I attempted to kill myself and winded up in hospital the next day , I was still drowsy from the pills I overdosed on and could barely see let alone hear a thing .
 I was so weak I couldn't even walk , I had to use a wheelchair, I went to the hospital bathroom (still in the drowsy state ) and came back to find both my parents sitting by my hospital bed .

Keep in mind my mom is a single mom and has been raising me for years now , I only saw my day once and at most 5 times a year so I was not expecting him . I got to the bed , sat down and my mom gave me a very worried and concerned look but befire she could say anything my dad open his mouth ...

His exact words were , ""Stop being depressed,  it's embarrassing me and I don't want to deal with your nonsense ."" 
That broke my heart , I knew he didn't care but I didn't think it was that bad , I was still in my drowsy state but the moment he said that I think I might be woken up a little . The rest of the conversation with them was a blur but I just remember being so fixated on what he said to me .

That was the last time we spoke , he didn't even wish me a happy birthday this year . I'm only 14 , he broke what little hope I had of us finally reuniting as daughter and dad , I didn't have alot of hope to begin with but damn.

depression,I am the singer of a pretty well known band and I struggle with suicidal thoughts every day,"Hi everyone. Like I said in the title, I am the singer of a pretty well known (european) band. Before this year we had shows almost every other week. It's fun, rewarding, great in almost every aspect. When I am on stage I am unbeatable, unkillable. But as soon I get off, I rarley talk to my bandmates, try and avoid fans and get as drunk as I possibly can. I wouldn't say that I have a problem with alchohol since I rarely drink unless it's after a show or a special occasion. I currently live with my gf of 1(soon to be 2) years. I love her but I can't talk to her about my feelings. Whenever I try to be open with her I get cold feet and chicken out.

I suffer, like many of you, in silence. My life might seem pretty alright from the outside, but from the inside I just want to fucking die. My music is embodiment of my feelings, hatred, sadness. Sure that helps me vent but I cannot for the life of me escape myself.

I also have an evil circle hanging over my head. I need to feel this hatred and sadness and shit and bile in my soul to be able to write. If I feel happy, on the rare occasion, I can't write. And if I can't write, I can't perfom.. See my problem? I want to be the embodiment of my art. I want to experience this pain to be able to write and perform it. This comes at the price of wanting to die every single day. How can I escape or deal with my emotions, when I use them to make a living?

Edit: I am moved by everyones effort to help. I can't do much to thank you but here is a poem that I wrote a while back. It won't rhyme in english but I hope that doesn't bother you.

You hold the suns warmth in your hand

when you touch me I become your man

to be thawn is not easy

the cold bites and doesn't feel right

if you've been frozen for all these years

a layer of ice to cover the wounds

you melt my heart you melt my soul

unlocks life and a whole new world

I love you with all my power

even though I never told you

&#x200B;

with the sun's rays dawns a new day

but there was something you didn't want to say

for cold winds can troubble a flame

you wanted to tell but not to hurt

when the warmth had gotten so weak

you said that it was I who had ended the day

that the frost and ice had put out your flame

you left no please stay

for a sun needs fuel and a spark

a chill needs only a coffin","Hang in there brother. You are the SINGER of a well known EURO band. You are literally everything this poor American musician longs for.

Let your beautiful art lead you away from these feelings. Let that be your escape from this messed up world. For me, writing about how I feel and turning that into a song is therapeutic.

depression,25 years old with absolutely no friends,"I'm a 25-year-old girl. I'll just get straight to the point. I have no friends, no boyfriend, nothing. Somehow I was the popular girl in class (I'm doing masters), and I was always surrounded by a huge group of ""friends"". All that changed this quarantine. I began to see how much I was never really needed in these people's lives. It first hit me on my birthday - the people I thought were close to me, didn't even bother doing a video call for me, or even send anything on my birthday. This was in stark contrast to another girl's birthday in the group - they all had a video call (I was told to join), made a loving video for her (compilation of clips and pictures), and had a small virtual party for her.

This really hurt me, and over the next few months, I saw them drifting more and more away. Now, this has been the pattern for ""friends"" throughout my life - my work friends, and even school friends. These all are people I was immensely close to at one point.   But now I'm not in touch with anyone. Whenever I do try to strike up conversations, they just humor me for a few minutes before ending the conversation. Or other times, they are already close with each other as a group and I feel like an outsider.

Another thing - whenever I thought I was best friends with someone, they instantly replaced me with someone bubblier, more extroverted, or more ""fun"" within months. This has happened to me since my school days. It hurt me a lot but I didn't speak about it for fear of looking desperate or being ridiculed. So I bottle it all in. An incident that will be always etched in my mind is something that happened on my 22nd birthday - my boyfriend at the time had broken up with me, and I was all alone. There was a girl who I naively thought was my best friend up until that time. I ended up buying and taking a cake to her place in the hopes that we would celebrate my bday, or maybe she had something planned for me (she did it for all her other friends). When I got there, she looked surprised and very very much like she pitied me. She hadn't even remembered my birthday.

It's come to the point that legit the only people that truly care for me and have time for me are my parents. That's it.

Idk what I'm trying to say with this post. Is there anyone out there who feels or experiences the same thing as me? How do you deal with it?

EDIT: I'm literally crying my eyes out with the support that's pouring in and the stories you all are sharing. I had no idea there are so many people who feel the same way as me. I'm at a loss for words seriously you guys are the best, thank you for making me feel like I'm not absolutely alone.

Maybe it is just ingrained things about us, body language, introversion, attitude, etc, although it seems I can find examples where the edgy depressed person with a sarcastic sense of humor or whatever gets to be a very popular person too, it's not always just the typical social butterflies. Some people seem celebrated for their strangeness while others are rejected for it. And it's just an unfortunate fact that most people who come around really are just in it for themselves and maybe friendships are never as mutual as we hope they are. They are either benefitting something from their interactions with us, or they are gone.

So I don't know. On one hand I always just try to believe it's for the best whenever we find out people aren't really our friends. It sucks, and the wish is for it to never happen in the first place, but if it's going to happen, it's best for it to happen as soon as possible so we don't invest more time in the wrong people.

I think other people might be more open to self-promotion than we realize. Maybe people remember their birthday because they are talking about it more themselves, maybe they are included in plans more often just because they are always part of the conversation or they are just attractive for being a bubblier person. Quiet people like to wait for people to remember them, notice them, include them, without having to ask. But I know, even trying to be the one who initiates more or messages people first doesn't always help.

I don't know. I'm not sure there's a fix. I doubt you do anything super abrasive or are deserving of having no friends. I have mainly been isolated for many years now too. It takes some mental strength to keep believing you are a decent person even if others don't seem drawn to you. Of course you don't want to be a narcissist either where you are getting negative feedback from the rest of the world but choose to believe there's nothing you could possibly be doing wrong. I actually invite criticism, when friends leave me I don't beg them to change their mind or anything, but I say could you take the time to let me know what I've done just because not understanding is the really painful part, and I've had ""friends"" of ten years who won't even give me the explanation when I ask like that. At that point I just have to believe there is something messed up with them, not me. I think the golden rule really is worth remembering, treating other people the way you want to be treated, and also analyzing the way someone is treating you and analyzing whether you think they would enjoy that in return. I have rarely ever felt the need to end a friendship with someone, but if I did and they politely asked me to just let them know what led to my decision, I can't imagine not being able to take three minutes to answer an email if I could give the person some closure and help them move on. 

People are strange. Everything about life is getting more selfish these days and our brains really are changing from the immediate gratification of technology and social media. Everything comes quick. People expect that nothing should be challenging or painful, no friendship is worth work when you can just leave them behind and find someone else, nothing should ever require patience or understanding. I don't like feeling like I'm probably just coping with my own rejection, but I try to think that maybe the best people aren't always going to be the most popular with the average people. I don't think the most interesting or thoughtful people are going to be the ones with 500 friends. But like I said maybe I'm just telling myself that.

You have to have your own code of ethics to get through it. Live up to a standard that you define, not other people. Despite having no friends I ask myself what could I be doing so wrong, I would do anything in my power for a friend who needed something, I was never demanding, always let other people choose what they wanted to do and when they were free to do it, always tried to check up on my friends, remember important events in their lives, etc etc. I've somehow ended up alone but I don't really see anything that I'm doing wrong so it is what it is. I don't know what makes me undesirable. I hate being fake more than anything, so this is me, and until someone wants to be kind enough to let me know what I might be doing wrong, I guess I'll never know. I know I can seem depressed and I'm probably not the most fun person in the world, maybe that's enough to explain it.

Sorry to know it is happening to anyone else out there. I guess most people really aren't meant to be in our lives forever. Whoever has demonstrated that they can't remember your birthday, won't include you in plans, I guess it's time to assume those are friendships that haven't stuck for you and you'll have to look for opportunities in the future to be making new connections.",1580,115,2020-11-15 07:56:51,juifes
depression,I finally went to see a psychiatrist and he straight up told me I don’t have a mental illness.,"I’m sorry if I sound mad and this is a rant, I’m fucking furious. 

So after 3 months of waiting, many years of putting all of this off, I finally get to see a psychiatrist. I drove 2 hours to get here, spent 20 bucks on parking, and I was told to fuck off. 

This guy could barely speak English, but all he talked about was how cannabis is bad and all my problems are from cannabis.  

I’ve been smoking daily for 2 years now, and Ill admit, it is a problem. But I’ve literally been dealing with mental health issues my whole life. 

He wouldn’t even let me speak and when I did he was just drawing on his notepad. He would just tell me that it’s cannabis and I need to go to rehab and once I stop smoking I’ll be fine. 

Bitch, I’m not fucking fine. 

There were so many things I needed to talk about, I literally think I have autism, and when I brought it up he didn’t even acknowledge it. I wanted to talk about anxiety issues and ADHD and ptsd, but apparently I have none of those and it’s just cannabis.  

My favourite part of the whole meeting was when he told me I just need a mom. I literally responded with, “well no shit, but my mom literally just died a few months ago so that’s not really an option.”

I’m so fucking pissed. My life is literally going to go no where and I’m never going to get help, so this is fucking fun.


Edit, thanks for all the support guys, I’ve got another doctors appointment set up to see a new psychiatrist so that’s cool. 

Please stop upvoting and commenting haha, I never wanted to get this much attention and only wanted the 3 people that usually respond lol",What a over inflated piece of crap mental health provider.

depression,i cant picture myself alive ten years from now,"i think im going to be alone forever. a failed musician who works a shitty 9-5 job at some department store wishing i spent my younger years better. once highschool ends i'll lose contact with pretty much all of my friends, live at home for a few years and then move out. try to make it in the music industry, but fail. end up working a mind numbing boring job 6 days a week, spending my days off alone. and then dying, maybe on purpose, maybe from an accident, maybe from an ""accident"".

also before you say it, YES i am young. YES you are probably much older than me. but does saying something like “you’re young so shut up” going to help in any way? no. it makes me feel worse about myself.
thanks for the responses anyways, i read them all.","Once high school ends? You're still there?

I'd say you're still got plenty of time and room to get to what you want! And you're young enough to fuck up a few times and still rebound. Also people are more forgiving to young people, even if it doesn't look it.

depression,My therapist thinks I'm too depressed for therapy,"So my therapist that I've only seen two times thinks I'm not a good candidate for therapy. She thinks that I'm too depressed for it despite being on heavy medications that I'm going to see a doctor about and re-evaluate in a few weeks.

She didn't think that a combination of psychotherapy and medications combined would work for me. Instead She suggested ECT treatment after only talking for 80 minutes total.

After doing extensive research this is only offered AFTER you have tried a combination of both therapy and meds and have psychotic symptoms and have a high risk for suicide, all of which I don't have. 

I am severely depressed but my life is incredibly stable for the first time in my life. I know how to handle my depression and my anxiety and do so very well (which she agreed on, mind you) but she still thinks I'm too depressed and she's afraid therapy might make it worse. 

I've done CBT before (only for my anxiety) so I am well aware it might get much worse before it gets better. Yet the CBT was very successful and no matter how hard it got and how badly I wanted to quit, I still showed up for every single appointment and did every homework I got. 

I am not a quitter nor will I ever be. 

All I want is some help to get better without frying my brain. Is that too much to ask for? Am I unreasonable for thinking that psychotherapy and trauma therapy might be a good place to start? 



Just needed to rant and vent a little. So if anyone actually read this far, thank you ❤️","I don’t mean to discredit a therapist and I’m not a professional, but every professional is different. I would try a different therapist. Sometimes, like meds, you need to try different therapists to find the one you vibe with. 

I personally read what your therapist said as, “You’re too far gone and I don’t want to be liable if I mess up but I also am not going to hospitalize you”  Which isn’t really a good sign IMO. Even if she said something differently and your interpretation is wrong, it still shows you aren’t on the same wave length with this therapist.

I’d try another therapist, find someone who can gel with you a bit better?",1553,81,2020-10-16 12:42:56,jc93qc
depression,I plan to kill myself tonight with a plastic bag (suffocation),"I'm 14
my mom doesn't take my mental health seriously and ignores what I've tried to tell her. And the reason why I want to commit suicide? Because of my life, my family, school. My mom says everyday that I'm useless, dumb, why can't I be like my brother. She says I'm a disappointment, why didn't see listen to the dreams from Jesus about me being a horrible daughter, how she wished she could abort me when she got the chance. My dad doesn't even do anything to stop my mom. My mom earlier this year pushed me on the floor, and choked me because she was really angry. I feel worthless, and pathetic. I have no friends at school, everyone ignores me, and I have zero social skills, how fun. My extended family doesnt even like me, my mom tells them heavily exaggerated stories about me that makes me look like a bad person. I'm failing math because I dont get any of the material, I tried seeking help, but my dad gets fed up with me not keeping up at his learning pace. I'm ugly, and skinny. My cousins make fun of my body, saying how I look like a flat stick. And on top of that, I can't even think straight anymore, suicidal thoughts and urges have basically took over my life. I feel like the odd person always, I feel disgusted with myself. Like I can't even look at myself without all these negative thoughts flooding in. I'm lonely, 0 social life. I've been dealing with this for 5 years, I cant take it anymore. Im burned out. I have no motivation to keep going. And before you say ""Your family will be sad"" I do not care. I am done. Maybe when I die I can finally seek the revenge I deserve. I just want to die, I'm still surprised that I lived to my 14th birthday. My mom says to ""Pray that I get better"" Or that I'm not reading enough of the bible. I'm SICK of it. She says a demon has probably took over me because I feel the way I feel. She knows that I'm deppressed and won't let me see a therapist. I hope that she can stop my brother from having the same fate as me.

depression,Do you ever feel like depression set you back a few years?,"I'm a sophomore in college right now and I am constantly surrounded by wise people... People who did things with their lives in high school and didn't waste it away crying, starving themselves, neglecting their work... They were able to partake in extracurriculars in spite of nervousness or not being nervous at all. They were able to accomplish things efficiently without attention or memory issues. They were able to make friends without poor social cues.

I had friends who manipulated me and threatened to commit suicide everyday, and even then I never had positive influences to help me. My parents were so busy with work that since my youth I was always alone at home. I have trouble having fun... I can't emotionally feel like a happy person, it's always forced. It doesn't come naturally to me so people didn't like people like me.

I'm too lazy to write this but basically I feel so bitter. I wish I did more so I could show off my potential but nope, I wasn't certain of myself ever. I'm trying to improve but my past latches onto me. ): Sigh.

Edit: I have something to add. First, I am very happy to see that some people can relate to at least the topic sentence of this post. We all feel like we were taken back by years because of some shitty stuff in my past. I also didn't get to finish writing this (because I hadn't the energy to finish) but there were moments where I stopped eating, showering, and brushing my teeth for very long periods of time. I also hid my feelings all the time. When people used to say, ""You don't understand!"" it would hurt so much because I really did in some way, or so I thought. I had speech therapy in middle school and general therapy in high school but I was never very honest because I was always afraid of the consequences. I feel a little bit of pride I guess saying this but I feel like I'm an example of someone who hid all their feelings and just wants it all, like all vomited and shat and sweated and cried out of me until I can remove it completely. Nowadays I struggle to even read sometimes, I just don;t have the strength, but I try.

I do say though writing this was therapeutic because I am severely overwhelmed saying this but thanks for reading.","I dunno if depression set me back or if I am just an aimless loser.

depression,Casually Suicidal,"Do you ever look at yourself in the mirror and think about death? You think about the consequences of it and what people's views are on it. Maybe you have even considered suicide. You brush it off, most likely. That is what most people do. People are scared. I am scared. Who would actually want to die though, right? This is what casually being suicidal is. Can you have suicidal thoughts and want to die at the same time? I have a fear of death. I always have, always will. How is it that some days I want everything to end, but I don’t at the same time? It's my biggest fear but also my biggest relief, my biggest wish. In reality, I just want the pain to stop. Why is everything so difficult? Sure, you would tell me to go get therapy, go get tested by a psychologist or something. As if that advice means anything. You want to label us, as if everyone feels the same thing, people like this are the same. In some ways, sure, they are. But most people don’t want to die, they want it to stop. What, exactly, do they want to stop? People. People are predictable. What other reasons are there for someone to want to go as far as think these awful thoughts? Even good people turn bad. Everyone is bad. Even me. People tell you to talk to others about these feelings, that it will help. But only people who experience these kinds of thoughts would understand, and even then it would give them this negative thing to relate to. Is that really a good thing? To relate, in wanting to die? Back to my point, what can people do? I can’t call myself depressed, because I’m not sad all the time. I can’t say I have anxiety, because I’m not anxious all the time. It goes on. The point of this paragraph is to say, don’t tell people to ask for advice, or say that you understand what they are going through. I always tell people what I’m going through, they brush it off. Talking about it can help. But only for the right people. For people like me, I don’t exactly know if I have specific mental health to blame everything on. I’m just feeling like this, that’s all.

depression,I tried to hang myself yesterday and they're talking about getting me into school in two days. F 13,"I am depression. The person I used to be is gone, there is no going back from this.

I've been on fluoxetine (prozac) for three months and everything is still getting worse. 

I just wish so much that the knot held, life just isnt for some people.","Definitely tell the doctor that you want to try new meds. There are SO MANY different types out there. I've been through three and am trying to change after years of success - I'm on a downward slide and need help. It's okay to admit you need help. I have MDD, diagnosed at 20, but lifelong sufferer.

depression,I will never understand how people can live and be happy,"Life is just objectively bad. Everything seems to be literally designed to bring you down. Even our own bodies are designed to keep us from being content. Think about drugs that make you feel good, eventually your body will reach a point where it needs more and more to reach the same effect. Until you overdose and die. You try to set up goals, you complete them and keep seeking more. You get money, you want more. People say practice graditude, for what? Why should I live a life where I constantly need to remind myself of trivial good things when everything is basically objectively bad? Your loved ones eventually die. You die. People kill each other on a daily basis. Do horrible things to each other. You work until you die. When you are young you have energy and time but no money. When you are an adult you have money and energy but no time. When you are old if you are lucky you have money and time but no energy and most likely riddled with sickness and lost most of your loved ones. Life is always out of balance to kick you down. The only way you can possibly live a nice life is if you are so rich you can just do whatever you want without working and help the ones you love to do the same. What are the odds of that? Almost zero. I'm just tired of it all. I wish I never existed, because life is simply not worth living and I don't think anyone will ever change my mind. No one has been able to help me.

I keep trying to force tears just to feel something ( as dramatic as it sounds ) , but nothing happens, I can never cry naturally , I have to force myself , and the minute I stop focusing on it , the tears dry up oops  . I feel isolated from everyone - like I can see my family / friends interacting but there’s like this chain keeping me rooted in place if that makes sense ? All communication is too much effort ? Let alone movement . The feeling of nothingness is almost safer and more comfortable and reliable ? I kinda prefer it than being happy I guess . Happy makes me feel vulnerable or uncomfortable . Everything good and bad in life comes from feelings .","To be honest, I always felt like that until awful things happened and the sadness and rage was so deep reality felt painful.

depression,“JuSt Go tO ThErApY”,"I see this here and other subs a lot. People vent about how shitty their lives are going or how they’re feeling (honestly; is anyone having a good time right now?). And the answers are usually: go to therapy. On the one hand, yea therapy is good for mental health shit. But it’s not that easy to actually get in. Especially in my country.

It took me a *year* to find a therapist that wasn’t booked and was open before 9 and after 5. Which was a non starter because lo and behold offices and jobs tend to want you working for them between 9am-5pm so you can’t go gallivanting off to talk to your therapist for an hour. Finally found one and come to find out my insurance won’t cover them. Going to this therapist costs me $99 a week. That’s more than I spend on groceries. I make a decent amount and haven’t yet been sacked because of covid but not many are as lucky as I.

Tldr: therapy isn’t easy to get into and isn’t cheap. “Go to therapy” is not a solution many people can take.",Therapy doesn’t help much for me but I still do it. I don’t know but being asked “ so how does that make you feel?” 20 times in an hour doesn’t provide me with any great insights.

depression,I feel beyond suicidal,"Anybody else have this? Suicide just feels completely pointless. Infact, everything does. People try to cheer you up and all they do is tell you to ""be practical"" and to ""stop being dramatic"" when you're not even showing any emotion the first place and all you're doing is lying there like a dead fish. Killing yourself is just another desperate solution to something that can't be fixed and even then suicide doesn't do anything except cause more pain to people. Not even dying seems appealing anymore. At this point I just want to lie in bed and sleep. And keep sleeping. And keep sleeping. But I can't even be afforded the option of giving up. If I do, people tell me I'm selfish and stick pitchforks in me. I ask why and the best answer I get for ""keeping going"" is just ""because you have to."" and then people get angry when you press them further because they can't really think of a reason either. It's just a blind desperation to survive we all have, like we're just that important. That need to survive other people have seems to have disappeared from me, and so has the need to die. I'm stuck here in this place and all I want to do is block it all out. Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed to piss. We keep going because we have to. But nobody ever tells me why.

Edit: Wow 1.3k upvotes and an award? This is the first post I've ever made here on this sub and you've all made me feel really welcome so thank you very much. I'm glad so many people get it. I knew I wasn't the only one out there who felt like this but to see the amount of traction this got and just how many people understood this makes me feel so much less alone. I wish I could thank each one of you individually! Thanks for being there Reddit. <3","You need to find your own reason why. 

Life is completely pointless and it always will be. Nothing you or anyone else in this world does matters. Everything will keep going forward. 

The only thing you can do is find your own reason to be here and keep going forward. It’s not easy... it’s really hard actually. By some fluke of the universe you, me, and everyone else here ending being alive. You’re only given one opportunity to be alive too. so you can either take your opportunity and make it your own or give it up and confine to society... or even die..

Don’t keep going or keep trying for anyone’s sake but your own. Everyone is telling you to keep going in their world/society. But you can go and find your own thing worth living for, you just gotta stay around long enough to see it. 

I do hope you start to feel a little better! Feeling nothing can take a toll on anyone..

Whenever i'm in school, downtown ... whenerver i'm not at home HE is still there and before this corona shit i slept smiling randomly when i had a conversation with him (in my head of course) and those looks (omfg the looks) other people gave me were something else.

I cant even blame anyone for laughing at me because wtf i'm 16 and while others go to the mall with their friend group i either get panic attacks or ho there with a person that only exists in my head.

depression,phrases im tired of hearing,"""it gets better"" 

for fleeting moments at best

""you are loved""

by who lmao? you, who doesn't even know my name? a stalker? 

""temporary problem""

well i guess this is techinally correct. no one lives forever

""theres so much to live for""

well maybe for you thats true, but for me who has  lost almost all motivation and ability to feel happiness its not relatable 

""what about your loved ones!""

okay thats just guilt trippy, and either way not everyone has loved ones/support systems just because you do janet 

""just exercise and drink water""

omg...thanks 🤩 /s

""what if something amazing and life changing happens that wouldn't if you died?""

yeah ive been carrying on that hope for years and here i am 

""just put yourself out there""

ive tried, so many times. part of the issue in the first place is that it usually never goes anywhere, and because of my mental health and abandonment issues people are usually driven away. also i completely lack the ability to maintain long term relationships, and have no idea what a healthy one is like in the first place. of course thats all assuming i cant get myself out of bed in the first place, find the social skills i dont have, and stop being an anxious little bitch. 

""god-""

shut up. i respect your religion but please shut the fuck up. 

""choose to be happy""

my ability to choose seems to be locked. should i put it in rice, turn it off and on?

""go to therapy""

sure, you paying?

depression,Why does depression and anxiety make it so fucking hard to tell if people actually like you?,Seriously- I can’t tell even if I’ve known them forever. Do they like me? Or are they just too nice to tell me how much they don’t. Today is a bad day and I’m just obsessing over everything.,"I believe the term is Distorted Thinking. It takes many forms, but one is making assumptions without evidence. In addition, depression makes you see things in a negative light. This can lead to mistrust of other people and yourself. You assume that others aren't sincere, and you don't see yourself as worthy of their friendship either. 

The best way I've found to deal with this is to look at the evidence I do have. Maybe I have an awkward conversation with someone that makes me think they must hate me on the inside. But then I think back to past interactions and remember that they helped me out last week without me asking, and that's stronger evidence that they like me rather than an awkward conversation meaning they hate me.",1408,54,2020-01-12 00:23:46,enfyh1

depression,"You ever get asked the ""where do you see yourself in five years?"" question in a job interview or something and have to stutter because ""probably not alive"" is the knee-jerk response?","First off, what a stupid fucking question to ask anyway.  What do you want to hear as the interviewer when you ask that question?  That I'm indifferent and stagnant enough to stay with your company that long assuming you hire me or that I'm ambitiously arrogant enough to in five years plan on being well passed this shit?  Fuckin' hell, man.

Undoubtedly there are varying degrees of suicidality just as there are reasons for doing it, all depends on the person.  I suppose I'm the sloth suicidal.  I've tip-toed through and around depression for the better part of my conscious life and I can't help but feel miserable an overwhelming percentage of the time.  Yet, when the obvious solution to this conundrum of despising being alive is ""well, don't be alive anymore"", the meddling safeguards of thinking about the wake of my actions swelling over everything and everyone I leave behind effectively whiteout any sort of blueprint I have for seeing myself out of my life.  Sounds rather counter-intuitive, but I'd rather my last thoughts be more ""you gave it a go, you're not doing anything wrong, you do you, kiddo"" and less ""hey, you're a tremendous asshole for this, I hope you know that.""

I can comfortably say I'm not doing it tonight, or tomorrow, or this year or even the next, but I genuinely feel like that's how I'm going out pending the absence of a freak car crash or lightning strike or some shit.

Don't even really know what I'm trying to say here, but do you ever feel like this?  Like life is essentially an existential clusterfuck that you want no part of, but for whatever fucking reason just can't make any sort of move?

Afterthought:  can't help but laugh that when driveling on in this post I look up at the browser tab and it says 'Submit to depression'

depression,I think my life is destined to end in suicide,"My depression never goes away even though I've cycled through different therapists and medication for 7+ years now.

I have had insomnia since I was a child. I can't sleep for days sometimes. It is fucked. And when I do sleep I sleep like 18 hours and still feel tired. It is very hard to keep up with my studies with this. Oh and I'm not in college but still trying to finish high school. It's not going well. I have no job and right now have about 50 bucks to live until january, after I payed my bills. I have no friends, strained relationship with family (basically just my mom, only child, father left when I was a baby) no one to talk to. No one cares about me. It's been like this all my life. Never had a single good relationship with anyone.

This all sucks but is not the why I think I will kill myself . I KNOW all of the things I could make my life go better but I just don't see it ever happening since my mental state never gets better. I've already experienced one psychotic episode. I feel constantly on the edge of sanity. I simply can't live like this much longer. There is no help for me i've tried the ""help"" so many times already. I think I will not make it to my next birthday. But that's alright, it will be a good thing for the world. I already have violent fantasies of just going to a mall and shooting people. It's best to end it before I harm somebody else. I'm not a good person and I wont be missed.

I didn't think it would get this kind of response, it was a nice suprise to wake up to since I really didn't believe there was anyone that cared anymore.

depression,Boyfriend finally succeeded in taking his life Sunday,"My boyfriend of 6 years suffered from extreme depression, anxiety, and OCD. I constantly would lurk on this subreddit looking for insight, hope, understanding...

He begged for death. He finally did it the day before his birthday. He left two teenage girls behind. They're devastated but their dad had pushed them out as far from him as possible months ago during this last episode of depression and anxiety. He was so afraid of them, he couldn't even speak to them on the phone. 

He sought out all types of help-- therapy, behavioral therapy, ketamine infusions, he got sober, exercised daily... We did it all together. For a while it worked. We had about 2 years of what could be called happiness. He still had depressive episodes in the wintertime but they dissolved by the late spring and early summer. This past winter he was so afraid of how bad it was getting... it didn't lift in the early spring and then COVID hit. He had dental issues come up. All OCD triggers. 

He would say to me ""if only it one just ONE thing... JUST my teeth or JUST COVID... maybe I could get through. I don't want to die""

I had to leave for the past few months to help my sister who has two young children while her husband is away in the military. She was leaving the kids home alone (oldest just turned 12) to go food shopping due to COVID. I was also offered an internship until October that I had spent the past year trying to get. I told him I would be back.

He wanted me to leave and stay at the same time. He had tried suicide several times before I left and my soul hurt so bad. Every time I looked at him it felt like I was looking at a ghost. We had him committed to a 10 day treatment facility but it didn't work. I knew there was a chance when I left that I would not see him again. He often told me he knew he was breaking my heart and soul and hated me around sometimes because he wasn't the person he used to be. We talked every single night while I was gone.  I told him since I was away it was okay to talk to me about anything because I could still get a break and had the energy to listen. I did not talk to him the past couple nights leading up to his death. I was with friends and family. I told him I would call him Sunday. He never answered

He was suffering so much. I hope that he is in a better place. Anywhere would be better than here. I just wish I picked up the phone the last night he called. I wish I picked up the phone for the very last time and I could have said I love you. This has been the worst year of my life.

depression,Have you ever felt like no one....literally no one cares about you?,,"YES. I feel like my life has been one big cry for help, but nobody has heard it. I’m so pathetic.",1365,136,2020-03-15 13:15:54,fj15uq
depression,I isolated myself for years as a coping mechanism for depression and as a result never grew as person but was content it wasn't possible to live like that. When I try anything I feel worse off because the lack of maturity towards anything having missed out on a lot of my fundamental formative years,,"I spent 3 years of school in homeschool because of the inability to make new friends and hated spending my time alone at school. The one friend i had was a grade lower than me. 
I never learned social skills, and when i returned to high school for senior year to try to salvage what i had left of teen life,  I could tell i was behind all the other kids in maturity.  The loneliest feeling to me isnt being isolated, its being surrounded by so many people who you just can’t communicate with and seeing everyone else fit when you can’t.   
I felt content in isolation,  i found myself,  which is something not everyone gets to do.  But my mom physically and mentally abused me the majority of the time i was at home. 


I think I’ve been depressed as long as i can remember.  Once i had even the slightest ability of reason as an 8 year old it started.  I got back in touch with my friend last month and she remembers all these stories about when we were growing up and shit was happening,  like my house being evicted and all this drama my dad had with his girlfriend. And  my mom neglecting her parental duties.  And i barely remember anything.  She says whenever these things happened i would get out of the area calmly and act strangely distant.  I think i blacked these things out entirely as a coping mechanism. I dont remember specifics,  i just remember it was bad.  Everything about growing up except my best friend was bad.  I honestly dont know what happened and i cant even begin to address these issues with a therapist because i dont remember them. And im apathetic about it until i remember more,  then i start getting sad again.  
I think my brain takes what little neutral or positive memories i have and tries to build my foundation out of them. But it feels like a void 


Sorry for ranting and getting off topic,  it seems like a common characteristic of depressed people in this sub.  Ultimately,  I’m attempting to relate, and i totally get what your saying. But I’m sorry for typing out so much about my childhood needlessly, its just something i have to get off my chest and theres really no where else for me to do that.


Anyway i hope you have a relatively good day and find some form of happiness or even just a form of escape from whatever you’re facing.",1366,44,2020-04-10 16:29:55,fyj4jw
depression,What's the point in asking for help if no one actually cares?,"I did everything right today. I gathered my thoughts. I talked to my best friend. And then I finally went to my husband and told him everything. The suicidal thoughts that have gotten worse over the past two weeks, that I think I'm experiencing delusions and paranoia, that I'm genuinely scared for my safety.

And all I really got was a ""we'll get through this"" and that was it. I mentioned possibly needing to go to the ER or look for an in-patient facility to get help because of how rapidly this was progressing and he told me ""but what if it financially ruins us? What then?"" And I just stopped. It's cheaper to bury me than it is to give a single fuck about me and help me get treatment. 

I did everything right. I fucking begged for help. But it's not that serious until you actually kill yourself and by then it's too fucking late.

*I have a therapist and psychiatrist. I've tried 20 plus meds with absolutely no benefit. I've been dismissed by every psych I've had because to them it's just depression and they won't listen regarding the delusions I'm having that are completely fucking up my life.","I think unless you experience depression you have no understanding how debilitating it is. My exe had depression and I tried to help but I really didn't know how or what she was/wasn't feeling.  I read the books and went to see her counsellor with her but was still lost . During one of her longer bouts and she treated me like shit and crying in bed i just lost it and said "" how can I help"" she didn't know how so I went to sleep- one of the biggest things I regretted. A few year later from stress etc I developed bouts of depression and fuck I cry thinking of the pain and void my exe went through throughout her life...i suppose  what I'm saying is loved ones care but have no idea what your going through",1359,44,2020-08-09 02:43:33,i6bzfs
depression,"Right now, killing myself sounds like an ideal idea","My life is stuck. I've been unemployed since April. I'm 25. Since the outbreak, my family with whom I still live, mainly my father, is putting so much  emotional stress on me, yet, without that stress, I don't think I would've gotten to where I am now. You can say the pain has pushed me to do stuff ( I started working on myself, meditating reading more, trying to excercize, damn I've started painting watercolor. I don't how we do it, but we always find away to misinterpret one another in my family, assuming the worst in the other, we lack communication (but isn't that something to blame on the parent for not initating it in childhood?) I don't know where I am right now, but the idea of not existing anymore is tempting me so bad. I'm tired of thinking. I know I won't do it, but man these thoughts, they stick around once they hold onto you, don't they? It's different when you want to end your life because your life sucks and when you want to end it because there are things you don't want to deal with anymore. I don't know, it lacks the self-pity. Feels almost like an act of self-love.

Edit: This is unbelievable! Thank you everyone for your incredible support. I hope everyone struggling finds hope like I have found in your comments. I think hypersensitivity is really a double-edged sword. I can't take negativity so well, but I aslo have the greatest ability to absorp hope and support if I find them, and I have, thanks to you guys. I feel surrounded by friends. It was a good idea to post this. I hope everyone takes the suicidal ideation discussed above with a grain of salt. I was really verging on madness. Who knows what I would have done if I didn't write this. After reading some comments, I'm reminded again that depression lies. Thank you again. I'll try to be kinder to myself.","I no longer want to kill myself, but if someone said me that I will die tomorrow. I wouldnt care.

depression,"I'm a lazy, pitiful 35 year old man child that never amounted to anything in his life, in debt, no degree, lives with his mom and can never follow through on anything.","Title says it all. My girlfriend broke up with me recently. She said I was a man child and she needed an actual man.

I'm old now. I look back and I don't remember ever growing up. I have 2 DWIs, an entry level job still, no college degree and I live at my mom's house with her fiance who I can't stand.

Any money I make I either spend it on video games or shopping and I racked up over $30k in debt.

I don't have a point or goal in my life and I feel like I'm already dying. 

I could have been something good in my life but here I am alone again. Every single woman I've been with has left me. 

I can't fucking sustain or follow through with anything. I didn't get a degree, I don't finish the projects I start, every idea I've had has never completeled, I've never fit in socially and at the time of writing this post, I don't see any real will to live.

I'd never kill myself because the people that do care about me would be hurt and I care about them way too much to hurt them, so instead I'm just floating through life, barely surviving, with no retirement, I'll probably die while still working as an old man.

I'm a pitiful 35 year old man and I just wanted to let everyone know. I don't have any reason to move forward and even if I did, I'd never follow through with it anyway.

I can't believe she still considers me her best friend since depression made me that boring. She talked to me about her day for half an hour and I didn't even know what to say, I have become socially useless.

depression,I'll be 40 in six months and have wanted to die since I was 12.I failed at life and want to die more than ever.,"**EDIT:** I'm so sorry guys. I spent an hour responding to more comments, only to have to delete them because I was mistakenly posting from my main account.

Nonetheless, I am grateful to each and every one of you, and each and every one of your words. For the first time in months, I do not feel so alone. Thank you.

&#x200B;

Despite all the years of meds and therapy and crisis counseling and being told ""things will get better, you're a beautiful strong woman and everything will turn out wonderfully if you just have patience""-I can say that, with less than six months until I turn 40, I feel no less depressed than the day I was hospitalized, at age 12, for trying to kill myself via starvation. I can say honestly that at that point, I had absolutely no trauma in my life. My parents did nothing but love and care for me. I just so happen to have a ""depressed"" brain...and the beginning of puberty allowed its awakening.

I was able to make it through high school because I went to a charter school specifically for kids with ""emotional disturbances"", but I only made it halfway through college before I had another full-fledged episode of depression and had to drop out (I was walking out of classes because I needed to cry for no reason).  I still lived at home, and about a year later my parents told me I need to work. The only job I could do, one that allowed me to come and go as I please, and take time off when I needed it, and still be able to support myself, was stripping. In the meantime I was violently raped by a ""friend"" of mine. I couldnt't deal with it, so I just went to work the next day like nothing happened, with a tampon up my ass so I wouldnt bleed everywhere. Supressed it as long as I could, until again I woke up and decided I wanted to die. Began therapy a few years later...last I saw he was happily married with children. My fucking rapist got the life I wanted and never had.....

While I was able to move out on my own thanks to dancing, after 7 years I was vomiting before shifts, And my boyfriend at the time had told me that he would never marry me as long as I was dancing. So, I decided I was mentally well enough to try school again, and graduated one year later with my certification in personal training. I spent a few years making minimum wage to build my experience, and finally I got a full-time gig with benefits. All the while noticing that my boyfriend still didnt seem into marrying me, it had been 6 years-he finally told me ""we are not financially stable yet"". Even tho he made over $100,000 a year...but alright.

Turns out, he was cheating on me with a goddamn stripclub bartender! I googled his email because I had forgotten his Amazon name, and ended up finding a whole bunch of shit that devastated me. His reaction was to first say "" I didnt think you'd ever find that"" (well, use a different handle than the one you always use next time), then to tell me that I needed to move out. Told him I didnt have the money to move out. He said he would pay for the deposit, but when I found a place-he couldnt produce it. Finally told me he didnt want me to leave after all,, we can work on this, blah. Until six months later, when he finally admitted-after 8 years-that he didnt want to marry me, ever. I just wasnt a good enough ""homemaker"". I finally asked for help from my one rich aunt, got the deposit, finally moved out..

While in the meantime, I had been promoted to head PT and trainer for new staff; despite the heartbreak at home, I actually had a job with a prestigous title (for me) and an actual, successful career. I was making enough to pay rent, and was on track for another raise...

Until 2 weeks later. When I was fired over the phone, because one front desk worker said she ""heard"" me jerking off a client on an recumbent bike. Seriously. Never in one million years would I have ever even thought of doing such a thing, but you know...she was 18 and her boyfriend enjoyed his workouts with me. That was enough for her to make sure I never worked there again...I was never accused once of jerking someone off when I was a goddam STRIPPER............

Of course with no job and no income, I was given one month's notice to move out. I found a cheap room, and was able to get some work at an old colleague's new gym. I didnt have a lot of hope for the future, but I still had a little.......

And then, I got Covid and almost died from it.

It's been six months and I'm still too weak to walk let alone train, too much brain fog to really do any sort of work, and only have two weeks of unemployment (that I had to fight for) left. I have no money and no job. No man has ever decided I was worthy enough of marriage or having a family with. My own body has become a shell of itself, and the hypoxia from Covid as well as the inflammation in my brain from it, has made my depression 1000x worse. I tell people I need help, physically and mentally, but all I have to do is say Trump could have handled this better-and they basically tell me I should kill myself because saying mean things about Trump hurts their feelings. Or, they're just so ""tired"" of the minimal restrictions that they freely admit, they just don't care about me or my health anymore. Because you know, people need indoor dining but they don't need me....

These are people who claim to love me, saying these things. This is my support system saying these things to me........

Can anyone here honestly say, if they were me, they would still have hope that ""things will get better""? I'm not doing another 40 years of this. And since Covid didn't kill me (though it came so close I was on oxygen for 6 days)-I'm nearing the point where I just have to do it myself.

Thanks for reading.","I don’t know how I got here, but I just want to say I’m so sorry for everything that you’ve been through and that no one has provided you with the support you’ve needed throughout your life. Life is fucking hard and you’ve had it harder than most. 

I was also raped when I was younger and kept this to myself, found myself in a deep depression after I found out that my ex I was living with and supporting his family was cheating on me. I thought about it too and just had to step away from everything in my life. I moved out of the country and just started a new life. That helped a little bc it allowed me to be alone and only have myself to live with and love.

Life has been shit and I’m so tired. I haven’t even read a book in months. I can’t study, can’t read, can’t even play video games with concentration anymore. I’m so tired and yet I have so many responsibilities.


Edit - Thank you to everyone who’s replying. I’m better now since the evening. I don’t know why but it was a sudden trigger. My car has been a way to just avoid any shitty situation. And losing the key was a very sudden trigger even though I knew I had another key. I get it’s a very weird thing to cry over but I just couldn’t stop. Thank you to all of you. The comments helped a lot.

depression,I hate that nobody can understand what trauma does to you,"And this compounds the depression.

Not only is childhood trauma (one in which your parents - who *should* have represented all that was good - were in fact, evil) one of the worst possible causes of depression - but the fact that nobody gives two shits other than telling you ""get over it,"" or ""seek help."" 

As if trauma is expected, but not ignoring it is not expected. You're supposed to conform to this place; to accept trauma as normal, if not something you *do*, normally.

And so you get even more depressed about the fact that nobody understands what it's like to be depressed.",I relate so hard to this man. Shitty parents ruin your life before it even started.

I know she’s not my therapist. I know that no one owes me anything. I wasn’t looking for her (or anyone else) to fix my problems or even offer advice. all I wanted was for someone to listen to me and maybe try to empathize. it would’ve meant the world to me just to express my feelings to someone and hear them say, “that sounds hard, I’m sorry you’re dealing with that,” instead of lecturing me.

depression,My dad is gone... forever,"This is so hard for me to talk about so I’m just gonna start. Sorry for the run on sentence and the mistakes. 


My dad died last week, on Friday actually. I have been trying to be so strong but it is so hard and I know he would be upset I’m needing this help but honestly I just need any supportive words. He was with his best friend and they got a call for a big contract (my dad and his roomate are electricians, my dad is 63 and retired but still helps his roomate our) my dad left the shop to go to the bank to pull out some money. He was 10 steps from the cross walk but he thought he could make it jay walking accross a 4 lane highway. The light was red and there was a big semi truck blocking the 2 lanes after the meridian. He tried to walk in between the semi and it’s trailer and the light turned green. I know all of you can imagine what happened next. I feel so fucked and so sad my dad has a good 15-20 years in him, he was healthy and happy. A little skinny from beer and coffee but he wasn’t no lazy old man. I have 3 brothers (27 year old,24 year old, 19 year old (me), and my little brother is 16.)
I just had a kid and I’m already so stressed about that cuz it was a little unexpected. And last my dad knew was it was going shitty and we were getting ready to go to court. I have been seeing him everyday since my son was born. I never even got a picture with my dad and my newly born son. Im also so worried about my mom because she gets like this over if she looses a pack of smokes. I don’t know how she is ever gonna be okay again. I don’t know if I’ll ever be okay. I just want to walk into my dads house hug him one more time laugh about anything. He always dropped whatever he was doing to help out family, no matter what. My mom and him were divorced for 20 years and when mental health kicked my moms butt and she couldn’t take care of my little brother and was about to go homeless my dad was there for her offering her his bed even after 20 years. I just keep rambling on because I really don’t even know how to end this I just don’t even know. I love you so much dad and I miss you. His favourite beer was Budweiser and I don’t drink beer so if anyone could pop a bud for my dad. Thank you. He also loved to fish. He was most happiest sitting on the lake with his boys fishing all day. I love my dad so much he was an asshole sometimes but that’s cuz he wanted what’s best for us and what dad isn’t an asshole sometimes. He never beat me or made me feel embarrassed he was always there. My youngest brother was even only my half brother but my dad called him his son, and my brother called him dad. I know my dad wasn’t a dumbass I fucking know that to the absolute top of anything. He just made a dumb idea. Must have been feeling 19 again. I love you so much dad. I’m gonna try everyday to be okay for you and to make sure mom will be okay. I’m gonna be the best dad just like you were to me. ❤️❤️❤️❤️","Going to say this as it has helped me. He is not gone until he is forgotten, so never ever ever forget him. Once someone is forgotten by everyone that is when they truly die. I think there is a quote about how we die 3 times. “There are three deaths. The first is when the body ceases to function. The second is when the body is consigned to the grave. The third is that moment, sometime in the future, when your name is spoken for the last time.” -David M. Eagleman. Think about the last death and make sure he lives as long as possible.


I have a grandfather that died when I was 7 and I don't even remember what he looks like BUT I remember who he was and one major thing that we did together. So I am actually super happy that Baskin Robbins has 4 locations in MN right now because we used to go there when I was a kid with him. Just in time for my birthday too, so I am going to go there get some ice cream and remember him soon. The memories of him that I have of him are few but all of his kindness and 1 foggy memory if when he was really sick with cancer.  My grandfather will die with me as my memories are keeping him alive. The same goes for my dogs, my cousin, and my other grandparents.",1254,69,2020-08-17 21:19:12,ibn6rc
depression,Does anyone ever feel physically too weak. Everyday I experience a rush of weakness or something. It’s hard to explain.,I’m beginning to wonder if I have a medical condition or if it’s just my depression. At some point in the day I’ll randomly just feel incredibly fatigued but it’ll usually pass in a few minutes. Almost as if my brain and body are shutting off.,Is it like when you just get too tired in hiding or fighting the pain inside. And you lose energy like you just fought a 6 hr non stop war?,1253,69,2020-02-01 15:29:40,ex7om6
depression,Hate the idea of doing any work...,"Am I only one that feels this way? Along with all the symptoms of depression, the one that I find the least common is the lack of willingness and ability to do anything. 

I hate it when I know I have uni work, I hate it when I have to do with the family somewhere, I hate it when I have to iron clothes, I can’t study, I can never do my laundry in time, etc

It’s not coming from a standpoint of, “oh I preferrr not to do workkkk today”.

Just work in general is painful to me. It can ruin my day just hearing that I have any task to complete. 

Many depressed people are still having fun going to work, doing chores, etc. But it feels like death to me.","I haven't met, or read about, any clinically depressed people that have fun going to work and doing chores. Some of the hallmarks of depression are lack of energy or fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and a lack of interest in things that used to give one pleasure. It's hard to imagine someone that is both tired, has difficulty concentrating, and not feeling much pleasure from activities having fun doing much of anything, especially things that require focus and take effort.  So, I think not having have the willingness and ability to do much of anything is probably the rule and not the exception for people with moderate to severe depression - that's one of the reasons it can be such a debilitating condition.",1234,69,2020-08-12 10:23:14,i8b9ho
depression,I'm going anti-social slowly.,"I've lost interest in finding friends.
It hurts me a lot when my OG friends from college starts ignoring me when they found a new better friend than me. Never talked to me anymore nor call me.

I wish i have a friend that i could talk personally to.

Idk what to do anymore.
Didn't expect growing up would be this fkn hurt.

I'm clinging to games and music to run away from all the problems i had.

I need someone to hug me and say ""its all gonna be okay"".

Guess some things are just too good to be true.","I have the same feelings as you my friend, 5 years at college and 4 months on a job weren't the best times of my life, seeing how most people are inconsiderate towards how I feel and how it's always about them, and me being always helpful and polite, made me a defensive and not too friendly now a days, I won't be rude but I will just be taking my caution with new people until certain criteria is met (until I can trust them really).

You're not anti-social, it's everyone's right to feel sad when their friends don't support them.

also a side note, anti-social is different from asocial (you probably meant the latter), the former means someone who doesn't care about other's rights and thinks they can violate it whenever they want.",1237,48,2020-03-01 13:41:39,fbu6ub
depression,I have lost my empathy.,"Before my depression, there was warmth and curiosity in my personality. When people I cared about told me their stories I listened and felt happy for them. When I saw a family member struggling I would feel compassion for them and I would do what I could to help them. 


I seem to have lost this. When someone tells me about themselves or their experiences, I don't care unless it affects me. Their stories are boring to listen to, even the closest life events. Engagements, marriages, accidents, ilness, none of it interests me. I feel extremely guilty over this and it's a big part of my illness. When I speak to someone, I feel intense anxiety and a bit of fear. It feels like the person speaking to me will get upset because I'm not enthustiastic or engaged in the conversation - as if they'll think I don't enjoy spending time with them and thus stop spending time with me. I'm afraid of losing them and being alone.


It's true, though - I don't enjoy spending time with them, which is part of why I feel so horrible in the first place. 
  

I know that the problem is me, not them. My friends and family are fantastic people and we've been very close in the past but when I think about my memories with them I feel nothing. I have avoided them for about 5 years because of this. I'll come to family gatherings when it's unavoidable, like Christmas, but every time I'm asked to come visit someone (or someone asks me if they can visit) I make up excuses.",[deleted],1230,60,2020-07-22 14:23:37,hvunye

depression,It’s not fair.,"I fucking hate it so much. People around me, just go through everything with so much energy and power and they’re still so happy and never exhausted.

I can’t remember the last time I was actually happy. I hate drinking because it makes me so fucking sad, but I love it because I can accept my sadness completely.

I don’t want to be lonely but I just want everyone to leave me alone so I can find the strength to kill myself. I hate it. I really hate it. It’s not fair, and fuck it. No one understands it, everyone asks me to open up and when I do they don’t know what to say.

I just wish everyone would leave and never have a good memory about me so I can kill myself.

How can you not just sit there and stew? How can you not freak the fuck out about how torturous life is? How can you take care of yourself completely and handle the weight of being sober? And then people tell you they care, but it just puts more of a distance between you and them. No one’s words can help. No one’s presence can help much either.

depression,My brother plans to kill himself on 7/2,"Hi everyone,

I'm 24 y/o female, my brother is a 19 y/o. Mid May, my brother was taken to the hospital for attempting suicide. His online friends called his college to request a wellness check and got the cops involved. They found him unconscious in his dorm room. 

We have a very toxic mom. To give you some context, my mom told him ""Do it right the next time so we don't have to drive 8 hours to pick you up."" She loves us but she's very immature, toxic, physically abusive, mentally abusive, etc. She's sort of a horrible human being but in her mind, she has done all she can for us. She had me when she was 19, single mom, we don't talk to our dad. 

He's set on doing it again because my brother and I have an extremely close relationship and he doesn't want to be a burden on me. He has been failing school, hates my mom, and feels like if he kills himself, my life will become better because my mom will realize she is the problem. But my mom will never know that. He thinks I'll be sad for a couple of years but I'll get through it because I'm a strong person. He has told my boyfriend that he has bought 100 pills this time for his second attempt. 

My brother is the best. But my mom has fucked him up so much. He feels like he doesn't deserve my love and feels extremely guilty that I'll have to take care of him when I went through so much to get where I am. I just graduated with a masters degree and looking for a job on the west coast.

I also want to note there is a genetic component. On my mom's side, my grandpa, my uncle have killed themselves. My mom has attempted suicide when I was in high school by jumping off our apartment but survived. I have been depressed since age 7 but became healthy two years ago. My brother has felt this way since he was 10. I told him once I get a job I can take him away forever and help him get his life back on track but he doesn't want to burden me. 

What do I do? Has anyone been in a situation like this?",Sit him down and have a genuine talk with him. Tell him how much he means to you even if he doesn’t see it. I’ve been suicidal all of my life. What would help is seeing very genuine care.,1162,52,2020-06-13 14:14:59,h88bej

depression,43 and completely lost,"I've never posted anything online before so I'll try to be succinct.  I'm 43 male, never married, no kids, on medical leave from my job for depression.  I'm so disappointed in the person I've become.  No matter how much I read or do, it's like I have not gained any wisdom on managing life's challenges.  I grew up in a loving home with lots of encouragement and high expectations.  I was an A student through college but my social skills have always been lacking.  I managed to work for the past 20 years, but I couldn't keep up in my current job, hence the medical leave.   

I've been in therapy for much of the past 10 years.  My psychologist believes I have traits of avoidant personality disorder.  I take several antidepressants and I'm currently two weeks into TMS therapy.  Nothing seems to help.  I'm unbelievably critical of myself.  Even now, as I write this message, I am certain that this will be the worst written message ever on Reddit.   I've been reading hundreds of other posts and they seem so well written.  I'm even more amazed by the responses.  How are you all able to find the words to share your wisdom and advice?  I read everything I can find on overcoming depression and avoiding suicide but it goes right through me and outv the other end with nothing retained.  I can't imagine giving advice to someone.  There is so little I can think of to say to people in distress.  

I'm a mess right now.  I have lost hope of getting better.  I don't exercise, I sleep 14 hours a day.  I have a house but I spend most nights at my parents.  Nothing traumatic has ever really happened to me.  The worst thing is that my ex-girlfriend cheated on me three years ago and I haven't dated since.  I have some solid friends that I've known since high school.  They are all very well adjusted and have careers and families of their own. 
I can't seem to learn anything these days.  I used to be smart but I am not longer able to learn new things.   I can't imagine surviving another 40 years.  I think about volunteering but I even tell myself that I have nothing valuable to offer.  I've no real skills to rely on.  I have saved about $300K in my 20 years of work. I had saved that money so that I could support having a family some day.  I no longer think I'm capable of having a family.  Too overwhelming.  I would be an awful spouse and father.
I don't plan to go back to work.  I plan to just live on my savings as long as I can and then end my life.  By then my parents will be gone and I won't hurt them.  My siblings and friends will be hurt in the near-term but they will be ok in the long run.  

I've read so much on coping with this disease.  But so little spurs me to action.  Until last year, I'm was microdosing with weed every morning to get myself going, keeping up with job and social occasions.  The weed stopped working for me though.  Now if I smoke, it gives me some paranoia that makes things worse.

I remember when my old roommate barged in to my room mistaking “I’m coming!” For “come in” I was always so careful about keeping roommates out of my room, always locking the door, because I was never more embarrassed. I saw the shock on her face as I rambled off reasons for the mess “I just dumped everything in here when I moved in, I’ve just been super busy with school and work has me exhausted” I know she didn’t buy it she must have thought I was the nastiest person alive, she asked if I wanted help but I declined and said I’d handle it. I never really did.


I can handle living in clutter. It’s all I’ve ever really known. I do wish I had a super cute and organized room but on the rare occasion I do try to organize everything it never lasts. But I feel so guilty. Guilty because I have a dog. He’s been my best bud for the last 15 years or so and he doesn’t deserve this life. Like I said we’ve always lived in a cluttered house but my room is the absolute worse. He gets fresh food and water and I try to take him outside often so there’s no accidents in here and he gets fresh air but he still does not deserve this. I know he walks around my piles of crap just fine and still runs full speed to see me when I walk through the door, his tail wagging so fast that his whole little body wiggles. I know he loves me and I love him with my entire heart. He’s one of the only things that keep me going because I’m afraid of what would happen to him if I were gone. I don’t think my family would be the best caretakers and I saw how the poor guy grieved when my mom died. I saw how he was confused and still went to her bedroom looking for her every single day for the longest time. When we’d pull up in the car he’d race to the passenger door and wait for her to come out. My family showed me how he kept finding his way into my room when I first left for college. I wouldn’t want to leave him hurt and confused like that so I keep pushing on. But I can’t let him keep living like this. 


I’m disgusted and deeply disappointed in myself but I’ll do my best to clean my room and throw some stuff away. It definitely will not be anywhere close to easy but I still want to try.


Edit: wow I did not expect to get such a huge response. I basically passed out on my bed right after posting this  but I only expected maybe 1 or 2 people to comment. Also a big thanks for the awards. It’s been a difficult path, I’ve been trying to clean for the past week or so and it feels like I haven’t made so much as a dent in the mess but I appreciate the kind words and motivation. I’ll be reading through the comments and try to respond to as many as I possibly can",My only advice would be do it as you can. Anything that is worth doing is worth doing poorly. It doesn't matter if you get all done at once just keep working at it. I just moved into my new dorm and already got a nest started. Would probably help if I had a trash can or trash bags. But I really just want to stay in bed.,1094,67,2020-09-18 08:08:46,iv21g3
depression,"I've never felt so sad, alone, lonely, and isolated before. At the same time I want to stay isolated. I don't want to socialize or be around people. I don't quite understand what's going on with me. I might be broken.","I know that I ""can"" talk to friends and family about my feelings but at the same time I just ""feel"" like there is no one I can talk to. Nor do I possess the capacity to voice my feelings aloud. Whenever I try talking with a friend I just clam up. I don't understand myself. I don't understand why I am like this. Why can't I just express how I'm feeling. Maybe because expressing feelings aloud makes them real or permanent. A perspective voiced gives permenamce to those thoughts. I'm still unsure of anything and everything.",Yeah I've been trying to understand how others can be so in tune with themselves that speaking comes as naturally as breathing,1085,28,2020-09-14 08:34:05,ish32s
depression,Angry suicide note ig,"Y’all fucking saw the signs so don’t u dare say I didn’t ask for help and that you feel so guilty and miserable. NO YOU FUXKING DO NOT. I asked for help and you just said it was my hormones and teenager shit well it’s been over fucking 6 years so why the fuck am I still like this!

I asked you to comfort me and be there for me and you just left me and said get over it. I asked if you would be sad if I died and you just laughed at me and said that’s FUNNY?!

You always complained that I changed so much and I’m not the bright smiling child I was. WELL FUCK YOU TOO. I ASKED FOR HELP I GAVE ALL THE SIGNS AND YOU JUST SHRUGGED ME OFF LIKE I WAS NOTHING! GREAT FUCKING JOB CUZ ALL I FEEL IS NOTHING AND THAT IM WORTHLESS. So don’t you dare say that you feel guilty because you have no right. No one cared for me so why the fuck should you be miserable when I’ve been this way FOR YEARS. I know I’m responsible for myself but fuck man I need help. I always did but no one was there so fuck this I’m out","No one wants you to die. Some people just don’t know how to handle depression or don’t take it seriously because they’ve never felt like you. I know it hurts. I’ve been in your spot. I’ll admit I went from anger to numbness. I don’t feel suicidal anymore, but I’d rather feel this way than how you do right now. It’s not ideal, but I’m not gonna give you some fake bs, you are your own person with your own thoughts. Anyways, I hope you manage to stay around a bit longer.

depression,i’m 17 and my mom just died.,"I’m gonna keep it short. Around 10:30 am i heard my brother scream is she dead?! I jolted up and walked out, there i see my mom dead on the floor with my dad trying CPR. We’re pretty sure she overdosed. No one saw this coming. I’m devastated. She was my best friend. Millions of memories with her helping and loving me. My family is struggling. I need help. I can’t live with this feeling. She was my best friend. I love her so much. Anything that can help me?

Thanks for all your honest answers, it just doesn’t feel real, i just feel like she’s gonna walk into my bedroom with food and give me a nice hug :(","You're already handling it better than I handled my mother's death. I shut down for a straight month, only talking to anyone I did was telling my boss what happened so I could get off work. 

This expression of your feelings to the internet is already a step in the right direction. Get your feelings out there, talk about it, don't expect what you feel now to go away all at once or any time soon. You have a grieving process ahead of you, it is going to suck, it is going to hurt.

Over time the feelings will be easier to deal with. Memories fade with time, including painful ones. Fading isn't the same as going away, it is always going to hurt when you think about it. But it will hurt less with time. 

Take care of your own needs first. Don't feel obligated to do anything, don't feel obligated to console your mom's friends, it is perfectly okay to avoid uncomfortable situations and worry about yourself. Don't worry about being selfish, you need to worry about you.",1084,79,2020-03-28 19:36:00,fqquhp

That's one of the main reasons I'm depressed. But I've told a few other depressed people about this and then they went like ""yeah, how about you try to kill yourself and start cutting, then you can come talk to me about your ""depression"" and ""hard life"""".",I call that shit the victim Olympics.  Shit my feelings are real and I dont have to qualify anything with my brain before it decides to have them so why would I have to justify them to somebody else?  Those people are assholes and they think they are entitled to extra sympathy because of their circumstances and that somehow means you dont get to have real feelings because your life is different.

depression,Annus Horribilus,"Today is the anniversary of my daughter's death. She died in my arms, and I am grateful I could be with her. She was 25, and we were very close; cut from the same cloth.
She had long suffered depression and social anxiety which manifested in anorexia and alcoholism, creating 'the perfect storm' that resulted in her death. She made no secret of her desire to die, but her death wasn't suicide, per se.
In the year prior to her passing I was diagnosed with esophegal cancer, and spent a lot of time in hospital getting treatment. Nobody expected me to live, and I think this hit my daughter especially hard as she was very emotionally dependent on me.
During my time in hospital my ex wife, my daughter's mother, came to stay with my daughter to care for her. I've since discovered, from reading my daughter's reddit, emails and texts, that her mother was drink and abusive the whole time.
I demanded to be released from hospital early, as my daughter's health had deteriorated, and they made arrangements to get me home. I was unable to speak in more than a whisper, had no esophegas and was fed through a tube in my stomach but I was happy to be home with my daughter. We spent quality time together.
When she died a few weeks later I arranged the funeral and the wake. I couldn't deliver a eulogy, or even toast her life.
My daughter had very few friends, partly because of her treatment resistant depression, and partly because she just didn't suffer fools lightly. But the friends she did have she treated like gold. One was hospitalised after a failed suicide attempt, and my daughter drove 400 kms to visit him, and she went back every day for days on end, just as example. None of them could manage to get to her funeral.
I have recovered, mostly, now. But I don't know why. I don't want to live. Especially after this past year.
I am posting this not out of self pity but as a belated eulogy to my very, very special daughter. Without her the world is black and white and devoid of happiness.","Keep going, be her eyes live any life she didn’t get to. Stay strong. Life is short as it is.",1077,37,2020-04-19 04:50:37,g41t6v

depression,February 22nd 2020,"I almost killed myself this past Saturday. I’m not sure if I was fully committed but I was invested enough to write a note, tidy up my room, and pick out which pills I was going to use to do it. My last cry for help was me sending my goodbye messages to my loved ones, I must’ve subconsciously known someone would come rescue me from myself. My friend came, my roommate came, my mother came... I took 6 pills but what I didn’t tell them that I kept slipping myself more. I knew I wouldn’t die but I wanted to come close— I wanted to know if death was truly what I wanted and if I got it I suppose my choice would’ve been made either way. My dad, whom I love dearly, flew in to be near me and I so very much appreciate it but to be quite honest, I don’t think this will be the last time I do this. I just don’t feel much except weariness anymore and I’m tired. To anyone reading this that may happen to know me irl by some miracle of a chance, thank you for being there for me :)","This sounds all too familiar, you could’ve been describing my week. Creepy. 

But yes, it’s so tiring. That’s exactly how I’ve been describing how I feel about life lately: I’m tired of it. 

And I know you probably feel so empty right now, I feel the same. Just empty, and things that used to bring me joy no longer do. But I’ve gone through this before, so I know it doesn’t last forever. 

I saw a quote that was like “what you’re stressing about right now, you’ll be looking back at in 10 years time wondering why you were so stressed over it”. Obviously that’s not 100% factual lol but the issues you’re dealing with right now could very well be resolved or have disappeared in 10 years time. Nothing is permanent, we all have the power to overcome things, it’s about the journey to harnessing that power, and it’s a tough journey. 

You’ve gotten through all these experiences so far in your life, this is just another hurdle, life is long and there’ll be so many ups and downs, but if you wait it out, the memories you’ll make in the ups are so worth it.

I’m so happy you’re with us, as I said your words remind me of how I’d describe my own feelings, so it’s quite surreal, even down to overdosing last week. You’re not alone in this.",1045,35,2020-02-25 22:45:45,f9ita6

depression,I feel too sensitive to exist,"Being insecure sucks. Not only does it wreck my feelings toward myself, I’ve become fragile to everything around me. To the people around me. I can’t take insults or arguing. I think everyone is mean or doesn’t like me. It feels so silly, but I can’t shake off the sadness.
My first thought when things make me upset is I don’t want to live. I don’t like being this way anymore. I just want to be perfect or at least less insecure. I don’t like sharing these feelings to people, but I want someone to understand.
How do I stop being fragile. I feel like I’m too broken to be around people and I’m happier alone.

depression,MY FAILURES MAKE ME FEEL GUILTY. I DON'T FEEL WORTHY TO HAVE FRIENDS OR BE AROUND FAMILY. ITS UNCOMFORTABLE AND CONVICTING.,"I just want to be successful already so this pain can go away. They say money can't make you happy, well money can solve most of my problems and most importantly I feel it will give my the confidence to truly be myself around people. I feel so bad that im such a disappointment to my family that Im scared to even show my face. Its hard to have or be with friends with no confidence in myself because Im not sure of myself and I have no confidence. I feel worthless, useless.","Sadly, that's exactly how our society is 'built', to make you feel inadequate if you're not financially succesful. And on top of that it's especially designed to kick you while you're down (depressed).

Depression is an illness, and society as it is only amplifies all that comes with it. I have no real advice on how to deal with this, I still struggle with it every day. 

I can tell you though, it's not necessarily you that's the most 'sick' in the equation of life, we suffer most, because the human experience has been distorted into something nature never intended it to be.

What I'm saying is, you are not the one that's failing here. Society as a whole is failing YOU.

Find your own way, to your own sense of humanity, if you can. I try to find it in tiny places, like keeping one (1) aloe plant alive. As long as he's hanging on, I can't give up gosh dangit!",1012,36,2020-09-07 14:42:22,io8mpe
depression,"Fuck life, fuck being awake.","I'm honestly angry that I'm still alive, why cant I just fucking die already? Life is nothing but endless suffering anyway, theres no point in living.","I feel you. 

I know you wont listen to any words of encuragement, cuz I wouldnt have when I was feeling like that. But I know what youre going through, and I might help you. Maybe not, but if you wanna die, why not try before you go?

If I can tell you one thing, its to try to accept yourself. Self love is a step above, so keep that as the step after. Relise that youre not worthless, nor a piece of shit, youre just someone going through a bad time. Its hard to see that when your brain is fucked up, I know. Thats why Im telling you this. Youre also probably at rock bottom cuz it feels like you cant get hurt anymore. Hopefully, one day youll jump off of it, and open yourself.

Things can change. They dont have to, but they can. So try to change things. The way you think, where you are, people you hang out with, anything. One of them will help.

Is this really what my life have become?","To be honest... I think there is no general purpose to life. I constantly seem to look at my past and present and find nothing that motivates me to do anything anymore. I've tried to find the beauty in things, tried to make meaningful social interactions, tried to help others, but... I never feel like it's enough. Maybe it's because humans are selfish creatures and we are used and use each other? Idk, but my temporary solution was to set a time limit as if I were to die in 5 years and create a bucket list and try to do everything on it before the timer ends.",998,37,2020-12-28 23:41:24,km202k
