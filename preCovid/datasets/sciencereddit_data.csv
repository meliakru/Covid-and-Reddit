science,"Scientists replaced 40 percent of cement with rice husk cinder, limestone crushing waste, and silica sand, giving concrete a rubber-like quality, six to nine times more crack-resistant than regular concrete. It self-seals, replaces cement with plentiful waste products, and should be cheaper to use.",,"For those not familiar with concrete, it typically is made from gravel, sand, cement, and water.  The water turns the cement powder into interlocking crystals that bind the other ingredients together.

There are a lot of recipes for concete, but the typical ""ordinary Portland Cement"" concrete is made with a cement that starts with about 5 parts limestone to 1 part shale.  These are burned in a high temperature kiln, which converts them chemically to a product that reacts with water.

Lots of other materials will do this too.  The ancient Romans dug up rock that had been burned by a volcano near Pozzolana, Italy.  The general category is thus called ""Pozzolans"". Coal furnace ash and blast furnace slag are also rocks that have been burned.  They have long been used as partial replacements for Portland Cement.  Rich husk ash and brick dust are other, less common, alternative cements.

Note: Natural coal isn't pure carbon.  It has varying amounts of rock mixed in with it. That's partly because the coal seams formed that way, and partly because the mining process sometimes gets some of the surrounding bedrock by accident.

Portland Cement got its name because the concrete it makes resembled  the natural stone quarried in Portland, England at the time.",97232,50,2019-11-03 10:46:58,dqysmm

science,Researchers first to uncover how the cannabis plant creates important pain-relieving molecules that are 30 times more powerful at reducing inflammation than Aspirin. The discovery unlocks the potential to create a naturally derived pain treatment for relief of acute and chronic pain beyond opioids.,,"I work in drug discovery and just want people to understand what they actually did and not be misled by the sensationalized title.

In this paper the authors show the biosynthetic pathway for cannflavins A and B, which describes the enzymes with which the cannabis plant makes these compounds.

They do not discover anything new about the *activity* of these compounds in humans. The claim in the title that cannflavins are ""30 times more powerful than aspirin"" was actually from a paper in 1985 (Source: M.L. Barrett, D. Gordon, F.J. Evans. Isolation from Cannabis sativa L. of cannflavin--a novel inhibitor of prostaglandin production Biochem. Pharmacol., 34 (1985), pp. 2019-2024). 

In this article, they used a single type of human cells (cultured synovial cells from the joint) and look at a single type of inflammatory marker (PGE2) and conclude that cannflavin works better than aspirin by a factor of 30, but also works worse than some other drugs that we have (indomethacin by 18x, dexamethasone by over 100x).

So, although the new research is very interesting in an academic sense, it's not really correct to make any kind of comment on how this compound can be a new or better anti-inflammatory based on such little preliminary data from 35 years ago. Of note, if we were to discover that the cannflavins had interesting drug-like properties in humans, we would not be using the pathway described in this paper to make it, but rather more efficient organic syntheses that we have at our disposal.

edit: thanks for the awards. I'm getting a lot of similar replies so I wanted to clarify a couple of things:

1) Regarding the experiment from 1985, I was just pointing out that when you compare 4 things in a study, the conclusion in the news article shouldn't be ""look at how much better #3 was compared to #4"" without mentioning #1 and 2. I'm not peddling indomethacin or dexamethasone; just highlighting that the experiment gives far too little data to say that any of these are better than the others for human use.

2) Cannflavins represent two out of potentially thousands of biologically active compounds in cannabis, if not more. For those of you who have had positive experiences with cannabis, there are many other molecules that can be studied to validate your experiences, even if this is not the one. Like many of you, I'm looking forward to future experiments in the field.",76468,40,2019-07-23 20:29:22,cgy0b3

science,New CDC study suggests that paid leave benefits — along with business practices that actively encourage employees to stay home while sick — are both necessary to reduce the transmission of ARI and influenza in workplaces.,,"I personally think the *amount* of paid leave you have is also really important.

science,Some parents have noticed that their autistic children’s behavioral symptoms diminished after a fever. A new study from MIT and Harvard in mice found that an immune molecule sometimes produced during infection suppresses a small region of the brain’s cortex linked to social behavioral deficits.,,"These researchers are amazing! They put in the work to account for most coincidental correlations, granted it was only in mice. So, IL-17a is normally produced by pregnant women while they’re sick. Additionally, a massive study in Denmark found that women who got a viral infection during their first trimester, were 3x more likely to birth an autistic child. These researchers found that, in autistic-like mice, IL-17a was produced during inflammatory immune responses. This molecule, il-17a, wasn’t only given to the mice with social disorders, but those were the only ones that it showed any curative effects. It actually had the opposite affect on normal mice. They also increased the autistic-like mices’ body temperature(the phenomenon was originally noticed in feverish autistic kids), and it had no affect; indicating it was an immune response that had these affects. Furthermore they blocked the il-17a receptors, and the curative affects stopped.


Edit: I do not mean to insult individuals with autism. This study seems to indicate it’s only tiny part of the brain that is affected. If this is the case, autistic people are far closer to normal than most would think.

It can be applied to any entity having a dispute, absolutely amazing.

His finding were that it really came down to two things:

1. Could they stay on topic, and discuss the heart/cause of the problem as opposed to the manifested facets. Could they discuss the disease, and not just the symptoms, and
2. Were they respectful in their discourse, or did they degrade to personal attacks that did not address the issue at hand.

Choosing your battles strategically is definitely the key, as many people argue about how they feel, as opposed to what the heart of the problem is, or they make fights out of things that should not be an issue.

Thought I am curious as to what ""more difficult to resolve"" means here. Dr. Gottman's finding are that this is exactly what should be address, the real issues (which are usually the ones that are more difficult to resolve), and that people usually default to fighting over nonsense precisely because they want to avoid the tougher talks, or don't know how to address them.

Edit 2: It seems people are still very concerned about the concept of a gazillion. 10^gazillion happens when you you type 10^ ... and then get too lazy to check what would be correct and so you type gazillion and accidentally forget to delete the ^ and it ends up as 10^gazillion and you don't care because the point is still the same: It's a big number. I say a gazillion = 81 or 82 because of how any people keep saying roughly how many atoms are in the Universe: 10^81 or maybe 10^82 or something around there.

This suggests that developing mindfulness could help procrastinators cope with their procrastination.",,"This goes well in hand with another article released this year (sorry I can't find the link to it) that said the biggest cause of procrastination is an inability to navigate or mitigate the negative emotions associated with doing a thing.

It also explains much of what we see in people presenting with ADHD.  Procrastination and a difficulty regulating emotions are two hallmark characteristics, which it increasingly seems are one in the same.

In people without executive impairment, it would make sense that mindfulness, which is the brain calling attention to itself, is much like a person consciously exercising the muscle of its executive function; analyzing and scrutinizing the signals coming from the various circuits and choosing one and muting others.

It also reminds me of a case study with a man who watched a violent movie and was then consumed with thoughts of murdering his girlfriend.  These thoughts consumed him and made him convinced he was evil or bad or wrong.

But after seeing a cognitive behavioral therapist, they made the conclusion that quote the contrary, it was because those thoughts disturbed him so much, and because he *gave* them so much weight and attention, that they recurred and disturbed him.

The reality is our brain is vast and full of a myriad of random thoughts and impulses, some dark, but our executive function is the switchboard that chooses what we think and what we disregard.  *That* is the reflection of who we are.

We have this fallacy wherein we think the *deepest* thoughts are the most real; that people who have private thoughts but do not act on them are *hiding' their true self; but nothing is less true.  It is who we choose to be and what we choose *not* to be and *not* to give weight to that is the best reflection of our self.",59798,49,2019-05-18 23:50:53,bqagww

The participant selection was not random, participants elected to go on retreat, and the overwhelming motivations behind those decisions were ""to understand myself"" and ""curiosity"".

Can the results be replicated in a random trial, without this bias?

science,A law restricting abortions in Texas resulted in more second trimester abortions due to women having more limited access to abortion services.,,"It's interesting to look at the change in types of abortions before and after the law.

The total number of abortions went down (64,902 to 53,174 the year after) but that was entirely due to the drop of medication abortions <12 weeks of gestation (17,739 to 4,593).  The number of surgical abortions < 12 weeks went slightly up (40,350 to 40,861), all abortions 12-15 weeks went up (5,531 to 5,813) and the number ≥16 weeks went increased dramatically (1,282 to 1,907).  Basically, this law just made it harder to get the least invasive procedures (first semester medication interventions).

Additionally, the authors also point out that previous studies reported increased numbers of women traveling out of state for abortions after House Bill 2, which may account for the overall drop of abortions.",48892,74,2019-05-24 14:48:37,bshtew

* This reversal was not performed in a closed system, but was instead driven by a specific device.
* The second law of thermodynamics still holds in general for closed systems.
* The flow of time was not ever actually reversed in this system, however a quantum states evolution was successfully reversed. Its cool and useful, but it's not time travel.

science,Scientists have directly shown that bacteria can “change shape” in the human body to avoid being targeted by antibiotics – a process that requires no genetic changes for the bacteria to continue growing.,,"Widespread antibiotic use is largely to blame for the emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria, which is currently one of the biggest threats to global health. Not only does antibiotic resistance already cause an estimated 700,000 deaths a year, it’s also made numerous infections, including pneumonia, tuberculosis, and gonorrhoea, harder to treat. Without knowing how to stop bacteria from developing antibiotic resistance, it’s predicted that preventable diseases could cause 10m deaths a year by 2050.

Some of the ways that bacteria become resistant to antibiotics is through changes in the bacteria’s genome. For example, bacteria can pump the antibiotics out, or they can break the antibiotics down. They can also stop growing and divide, which makes them difficult to spot for the immune system.

However, our research has focused on another little known method that bacteria use to become antibiotic resistant. We have directly shown that bacteria can “change shape” in the human body to avoid being targeted by antibiotics – a process that requires no genetic changes for the bacteria to continue growing.

Virtually all bacteria are surrounded by a structure called the cell wall. The wall is like a thick jacket which protects against environmental stresses and prevents the cell from bursting. It gives bacteria a regular shape (for example, a rod or a sphere), and helps them divide efficiently.

What this has taught me is that if you think you are a moral person, look very carefully for this sort of trickle-down behaviour from your company's top tiers, because you might find you start to compromise on what you like about yourself if it's there and you stay there too long.

ABSTRACT:
Predicting longer-term mortality risk requires collection of clinical data, which is often cumbersome. Therefore, we use a well-standardized metabolomics platform to identify metabolic predictors of long-term mortality in the circulation of 44,168 individuals (age at baseline 18–109), of whom 5512 died during follow-up. We apply a stepwise (forward-backward) procedure based on meta-analysis results and identify 14 circulating biomarkers independently associating with all-cause mortality. Overall, these associations are similar in men and women and across different age strata. We subsequently show that the prediction accuracy of 5- and 10-year mortality based on a model containing the identified biomarkers and sex (C-statistic = 0.837 and 0.830, respectively) is better than that of a model containing conventional risk factors for mortality (C-statistic = 0.772 and 0.790, respectively). The use of the identified metabolic profile as a predictor of mortality or surrogate endpoint in clinical studies needs further investigation.


**TL;DR** [the 14 biomarkers are listed in Table 2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-11311-9/tables/2):

1. Total lipids in chylomicrons and extremely large VLDL^
1. Total lipids in small HDL^
1. Mean diameter for VLDL particles^ 
1. Ratio of polyunsaturated fatty acids to total fatty acids (%)^
1. Glucose*
1. Lactate* 
1. Histidine^
1. Isoleucine*
1. Leucine^
1. Valine^
1. Phenylalanine* 
1. Acetoacetate* 
1. Albumin^
1. Glycoprotein acetyls*

*""For the total lipids in chylomicrons and extremely large VLDL and small high-density lipoprotein (HDL), the mean diameter for VLDL particles, the ratio of polyunsaturated fatty acids to total fatty acids, and the concentrations of histidine, leucine, valine, and albumin a higher level is associated with decreased mortality, while for the concentrations of glucose, lactate, isoleucine, phenylalanine, acetoacetate, and GlycA the opposite applies (Table 2 and Supplementary Data 1)...""*

#AKA
biomarker denoted with ^ = high level is good

biomarker denoted with * = high level is bad

**EDIT 2** (15 hrs later): Proverbial: ""RIP my inbox"", ""Wow, thanks for the gold!""...(But seriously, I didn't predict this feedback, and 'thank you')...

*  Most importantly, I just tried to report what the *researchers* found. As with any science, the findings ONLY 1) present a possible new mortality-predictive test; 2)open up new questions + experiments as to *WHY* high levels of some markers are good and others bad. In other words, *I don't know WHY some markers are 'good' and some 'bad'.*
* I *hypothesize* that some of these markers are just markers rather than direct actors in mortality -- symptoms that serve as biological 'flags' for underlying problems that, ultimately, shorten lifespan. That is, [some of those 'bad' markers are  **essential amino acids** that you NEED in your diet bec. your body cannot make them.](https://ucdintegrativemedicine.com/2016/02/the-essentials-part-one/#gs.xjhos8). **So don't avoid eating foods with isoleucine and phenylalanine because you'll be malnourished and may bring about an artificially early death!** But, again, the '*these biomarkers are just a measurable flag for an underlying disease'* is just a hypothesis *I made* that would need to be tested by further study. (Yay science!). 
* I wrote the summary bec. I was frustrated the 'layman's' article with the clickbait title *didn't even mention WHAT were the 14 molecules!* The most frustrating type of clickbait -- clickbait without the reward for clicking...Since I had the time, I wrote the summary since I didn't see it in top-level comments at the time I read this thread.

1) The authors are actually quite conservative - “the mealworms are the solution” stuff is the press department, they actually expected to see accumulation of these things and were worried and thus were quite surprised when they could not find evidence of it bioaccumulating. But also they are very clear it should be studied more before implemented.

2) The carbon from the plastic actually does get incorporated into the mealworm (ie they do actually “eat” it), they don’t just poop it out the other end. Lots of it either gets incorporated into the worm or reduced to co2 (which is a form of digestion).

3) They have found that the mealworms can eat polystyrene and polyethylene and are looking at others. So they may not be able to eat all plastics but can eat at least two fairly structurally different plastics.

4) The author 1000% thinks reducing plastic production/waste is as important or more important than getting rid of existing plastic, but thinks you need both (it’s not an either/or situation).",43663,103,2019-12-21 13:40:05,edq0wn
