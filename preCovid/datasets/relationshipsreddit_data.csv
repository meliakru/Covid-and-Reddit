relationships,"[UPDATE] My (28F) colleague (30F) didn't invite me to her wedding, and it's completely unravelled our friendship","[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/bctq5b/my_28f_colleague_30f_didnt_invite_me_to_her/)  


So it took me a few days to decide the best way to approach this, but yesterday I had lunch with her again and had the conversation. 

I started by saying: ""So you've sent all your invitations out now, haven't you?""

She looked immediately panicked by my question and I knew right away that she didn't want me to go down this road. 

When she said she had sent them all, I asked if that meant she could show me her venue now. 

She showed me the website of it, including the photo gallery, and talked me through all about where everything was going to happen, all the flowers and decorations she was going to add etc. It's a nice enough country hotel with some pretty gardens, but I'm not sure what all the secrecy was for. 

I probed a little more, asking who she's invited from work (the list didn't include me), said I was looking forward to seeing the photos so I could see how everything looked (she didn't correct me that I would see it on the day) and then I was completely sure that my lack of invitation wasn't an accident. She looked so relieved when I switched subject and asked if she's excited about her honeymoon and having a rest from all the wedding stress. 

So I'm definitely not invited. I thought it over carefully and I have decided not to ask why, for three reasons:

1) The reason is already fairly obvious. She clearly doesn't think we're anything more than colleagues and I've misread the situation. (There were some other theories suggested e.g. jealous husband-to-be, associating me with her past grief, but considering everything I know about her and our history I'm sure it's not that.) I'm not sure why she didn't cool it on the wedding talk with someone she had no intention of inviting, or even just bring it up with me and explain why I'm not invited, but never mind.  
2) Having an awkward relationship at work is the last thing I want. I'm worried that if I push this and turn it into an ""issue"" that I'll look pathetic and needy, or it will just be unprofessional. I also run the risk of her badmouthing me to colleagues and mutual friends, and I will find it much easier and less messy to handle my own feelings quietly.   
3) This is a once in a lifetime experience for her, and I don't want to be the source of drama that dampens her spirits at all. I'd rather just let her enjoy her wedding, make good memories and not bring her down. 

And you know, I'm fine with not going. It was never really about getting invited to a wedding, it was more having to face the fact that I'd been naive and taken for granted, and I felt silly that I'd invested way too much in this relationship. That's not all on her, because she was never obligated to be my friend.

Talking it through on my previous post actually really helped me work through my feelings. When I went back to work on Monday I felt much calmer and more detached from it emotionally. 

I have looked back on our whole relationship and honestly she's always been self involved, entitled and narcissistic. Being a bride has just made it more obvious, but it's always been there. She's also never given back to me (besides helping me get my job, which of course I'm grateful for), in that she's never been willing to talk me through any problems I've had, and although I help her happily with her work, she says no if I ask her for help in return.

She has a few office enemies and even though I saw her negative traits that caused her to be disliked by some people, I overlooked them and defended her anyway. Now I have put a little distance there it's quite apparent that she's not a very nice person, and I'm genuinely OK with just moving on.

She hasn't really noticed the distance between us so far (or she has noticed and doesn't care/is relieved that I'm giving her space), so I intend to just continue with doing that. If she eventually asks why, or I get the sense that she's trying to rekindle our friendship, then it will be time to clear the air with how I've been feeling. If she doesn't and we just continue drifting, then that's probably for the best.

It's sad to lose a friend, and it will probably take me some time to get over it and to become comfortable with the change in our relationship, but I have other genuine friendships, and plenty of colleagues who are lovely people who I can get to know better now.

The main thing I really took from my original post, and I'm so glad I did post because I needed some tough love on this, is that my fear of confrontation really needs dealing with. 

If I can learn how to better speak my mind as things are happening, that will stop things from building and building until I have to have a Serious Conversation and it makes what should have been a molehill into a mountain. 

I also need to figure out how to have difficult conversations without having an anxiety attack, which not only weakens my message but is extremely distressing and puts me off dealing with things and being honest with people. 

I had a couple of books on assertiveness recommended to me, so I've bought them to start me off. I'm also looking into going to a coach, or maybe a couple of therapy sessions at least, to try and better myself. I don't want to hurt other people by doing this, so this has become top priority for me. 

Thank you so much everyone who pointed that out to me. I was aware of it but I didn't think it was a problem and figured I'd just be that way all my life. Now I know better. Thank you for being so honest with me.

Also thank you to those who talked me through the one-sided friendship issue. I'm a good listener and have always attracted people who need to vent, but I only ever noticed the one-off conversations, and didn't think I was being taken advantage of as a long term listening ear.

I have been examining my other friendships in the last few days, to see if anyone else is using me in the same way, or if I've even been doing this to others and not had the self awareness to realise. There are a couple of changes I need to make, including a friendship that I need to set some boundaries in, and another one where I've not been giving back to the other person as much I should have. I have learned a really valuable lesson from this about maintaining healthy relationships, and I'm very grateful for that.

&#x200B;

TL;DR So I'm definitely not invited, our friendship is likely over (but that's actually OK) and I'm going to work on my assertiveness so I can handle things like this better next time. I'm also going to move forward having learned a good lesson about friendships being two-way.

Soon after I made the post, my husband called me. He was babbling and I couldn't understand him, so I kept asking him to slow down. Then he started screaming (not yelling, literally just screaming). I freaked out because I thought he was being murdered or something. I tracked his phone to a park in town and called 911.

Turns out he had a complete mental breakdown. He's in the process of being diagnosed with a mental illness that usually shows up in people's 20s but for some reason manifested later in him. He's currently in an inpatient mental health program and already doing a lot better.

Thank you all again for the responses and advice on my original post.

relationships,My (30F) husband (32M) impulse bought a dog. [update],"Update to https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/cmu75w/my_30f_husband_32m_impulse_bought_a_dog/

Thank you all for the thorough responses. I read every comment you guys sent.

A few months ago I read a post where a woman sat down with her husband and outlined everything she takes care of at home in a list format. Like, kitchen: trash, dishes, wipe counters down. Etc. That way of communicating really stuck with me and when we went to see our therapist, I used the same format to express how much I do for the dog.

My husband told me that owning a dog was a joint effort and since I’m home all day it shouldn’t be a problem.

Which is when I realized that has been his excuse for everything. Cooking, chores, cleaning. I’m not sure how I became blind to it. I don’t know when I started bending over backwards to accommodate him.

We used to be a solid couple who helped each other out. I remember when I was still in school he’d come over to my apartment and clean the whole thing for me during finals. Or he took care of my elderly cat when I was away for a week and a half. He used to help me dry the dishes and it was always fun. We used to have so much fun and laugh all the time. At some point it all stopped.

I started crying right there in the middle of a sentence and he got concerned. I’m not a cryer the only time he’s ever seen me cry was when I had to put my beloved cat down a few years ago. But he held me for the first time in what felt like months and we had a serious heart to heart about how he made me feel. Not only with the dog but how stressed I’ve been with my job, how lonely I am, I don’t feel important and how we don’t feel like a team anymore, that I’m worried about us.

I guess it clicked for him because he really stepped up taking care of the dog. He started going into work earlier so he can come home early and hang out and make me dinner. It happened slowly over the course of the last few weeks and the routine suits us a lot better. We hired a trainer to make sure we can understand the dog’s boundaries together and the dog sleeps in a dog bed. Our bedroom life has slowly gotten back to where it was when we got married. We’re watching our favorite shows again and going out more. I’ve been putting my foot down more about my feelings and he has been receptive. We are still going to therapy for now. 

As for the dog, we’re going to keep him. Is he a No List dog? Yes. But is he a good puppy with a big heart? Yes. We have the money to afford him and he took off after training. It’s nice having a dog again.

TL;DR: husband and I went to therapy, we talked through our problems, we are giving our marriage the time and attention it needs to mend. We’re keeping the dog.",This is a wholesome update. :),10388,103,2019-08-30 13:05:29,cxgnob
relationships,Update: My wife [28F] found out that my mother [59F] and I [28M] have been lying to her about our (me and my wife's) baby [0M] for months,"Original: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/az648p/my\_wife\_28f\_found\_out\_that\_my\_mother\_59f\_and\_i/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/az648p/my_wife_28f_found_out_that_my_mother_59f_and_i/)

Don't think anyone would particularly care about an update but I all appreciated the insight anyways. So here's an update:

After I wrote the original post, my mom took my son to stay overnight with my wife's sister so that the two of us could have the house to ourselves.

We pretty much just talked for an hour while constantly reaffirming that we love each other a lot and want to sort this out. I apologized and explained why I did what I did. She said that feeling like she was there for our son's milestones was really just a band-aid solution that didn't actually convince her she was present. She said that if she actually *had* been using the milestones to feel like she was present, this would probably have felt worse for her. But since she wasn't, in her words, ""deluding herself into thinking she's actually home"", her main issue was that I lied which hurt her feelings. I apologized and explained that I honestly thought that she would prefer the lying if given the choice. She said she understood where I was coming from and that she felt betrayed when she realized, but she sees that I was doing it because I love her and she thinks we'll probably laugh about it with our grandkids one day (yes, I am very aware I don't deserve my wife).

Some things came out on my end that I wasn't going to tell her and didn't mention in my last post- namely, that I'm scared she's going to become suicidal. My uncle committed suicide when I was a child, in part from working in a high-stress job where he made a huge and costly mistake. One of my wife's colleagues attempted suicide while she was on mat leave. Being a working mom is bad enough, being a resident in this program is bad enough, both combined are a recipe for trouble. Since our son was born and the incident with her colleague happened, I've been afraid that if her home life wasn't perfect, it would push her over the edge. Anyways, she reassured me that that's not happening and I think saying it out loud also made me realize it's a pretty irrational, groundless fear.

We ordered takeout and sat together watching the real videos I have of all our son's firsts. I also have a special folder of pictures/videos of my son with my wife, so we went through that after. She almost choked from laughing so hard when I tentatively revealed the beanbag trick. I am the laughing stock of her friend-group chat. So I guess we're already at the stage where we're laughing about it.

Thank you to those who responded to the last post! The stereotype of *someone* in [r/relationships](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships) advocating divorce every time anything happens is true.

tl;dr: marriage is work. I am stupid. We moved past it.","I've always heard that NO firsts ever happen in daycare. Until Mom sees it happening, it didn't happen. Many grandparents feel the same way. ",9880,159,2019-03-11 22:20:05,azzp25
relationships,"UPDATE: My [24 F] boyfriend [26 M] of 6 months told me that I need to ""unlove"" the men from my past before I can love him.","Link to original post [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ccl1gt/my\_24\_f\_boyfriend\_26\_m\_of\_6\_months\_told\_me\_that\_i/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ccl1gt/my_24_f_boyfriend_26_m_of_6_months_told_me_that_i/)

Figured I'd update my post from about a month ago. Unfortunately, there wasn't a happy ending, but I am very grateful for a lot of the advice I received here. Thank you, reddit, for helping me keep my head on straight!

After I made my first post, I read all the comments and thought about everything for a few days. A lot of people mentioned that they would not be comfortable with the frequency of my communication with my ex. I thought that was very fair. People also mentioned that Mark's behavior was pretty controlling and not ok. I also thought that was fair.

I went to talk to Mark and told him that I understood if he was uncomfortable with me being in touch with Eli weekly, and that I would be totally willing to cut that down. I also reiterated again that I was not currently in love with Eli and hadn't been for a while. Mark was understanding this time and seemed happy with the fact that I offered to cut down my contact with Eli.

But then I told Mark that although I was willing to do this, I wasn't happy with how he approached the issue and that I found his behavior controlling. I basically told him that I want him to approach issues in a more rational way and I would appreciate if he opened a dialogue rather than just telling me what to do, and that I wouldn't put up with him trying to ""command"" me to do something (especially something so ridiculous). I said everything in the same tone as I used for the first half of the conversation - I wasn't yelling at him or admonishing him, just trying to let him know where my boundaries are.

You guys - Mark. Flew. Off. The. Handle. He started SCREAMING at me. I obviously wasn't having it, so I got up to leave. He started throwing dishes and random kitchen items at me, and grabbed me and slammed my head into the door jam. I ended up with a nasty black eye and a busted lip. Luckily for me, a neighbor heard the commotion and called the cops. Mark was arrested and I was taken to the hospital. Yes, I'm pressing charges and filed for a restraining order.

Overall, it was a horrible incident but I'm glad this happened earlier in the relationship rather than later. And I am forever grateful for the neighbor who called the cops. Im also grateful to (most of) you guys for telling me that I wasn't being insane in my first post and for pointing out the early warning signs. It wasn't the best ending, but I'm ok and I'm just glad it's over. Take this as a cautionary tale, I guess!

TLDR: tried to have a rational conversation with Mark, he gave me a black eye and busted lip, it's over (thank God).

EDIT: I've gotten a lot of concerned messages (which I appreciate!) telling me to watch out for Mark now and that abusers are often at their most dangerous right after a breakup. Just to ease everyone's mind: I'm staying with a classmate (who Mark does not know) for the time being, so I'm well-protected! Thanks everyone!","Him: WOULD A CONTROLLING PSYCHO DO THIS?!

relationships,(Update) How do I (28f) break up with someone when I’m their (31m) everything?,"[Link to original post. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/aab0wm/how_do_i_28f_break_up_with_someone_when_im_their/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)

Straight to it: I broke up with him a day after I made my original post a few months ago. I was emboldened by the support and, strangely enough, even some of the negative comments. I came home from work and blurted it out, straight and to the point. I told him that I wasn’t happy, I hadn’t been for a while, and that we would be separating. We agreed that he could stay in the extra bedroom for a few months while we got everything sorted but when the lease was up we would be going our separate ways. 

The last few months have been hard. He went into full blown panic mode, promised to change in the ways I had waited years for, and had several actual melt downs begging me to stay. It was painful, but my resolve to live my own life never wavered. 

I just signed a new lease (by myself) and have begun to casually date someone in the same field as me. Life has an excitement to it that I haven’t felt in years, it’s like I’ve taken my first deep breath in a long time. 

So, if you’re on the fence about leaving someone but your lives are so enmeshed that you don’t see how it is possible: put yourself first, there is always a way out. Thank you! 

TLDR: I broke up with my codependent boyfriend and am the happiest I have been in years. ","Amen.

Leases, shared bills, mutual enjoyment of GOTs or Survivor while everything else is terrible is no reason to stay together.

relationships,[UPDATE] Me [31F] with my husband [35 M] married 2 years together for 10. He doesn't want his kids to be like me.,"https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2i34pr/me_31_f_with_my_husband_35_m_married_2_years/

It took me 3 more years, but I finally left him last year.

This post helped me see how much was wrong in our relationship, but I was still so hesitant to leave.

We had pets and a beautiful home together and I loved his family and we had so many inside jokes and plans for the future.

But eventually it was all just too much for me to take any longer. The day after his parents' 50th anniversary party, I told him I wanted a divorce. I just couldn't see myself living like that for 50 years.

I moved from the suburbs to the city with a friend. I rekindled some old friendships from high school and made a bunch of new friends who I am so thankful for. He kept the dog, I took the cats.

**I thought my life was ending but it was just beginning.**

I told my (very religious) family and they were all understanding and supportive. I've maintained friendships with a good number of our mutual friends, friendships I was worried about losing.

I'm working on my masters degree and volunteering and experiencing life and love and art and beauty like I never thought was possible.

I met a guy at a friend's punk rock show and we hit it off, but we are taking things very slowly. He is wonderful and so kind to me.

**If you are in an abusive relationship, please don't be afraid to leave.**

It gets so much better. I still miss him from time to time. I feel guilty about getting divorced, guilty for wasting my parents money on a failed marriage. I miss his parents. I miss my dog.

But I am SO MUCH happier. My future feels uncertain, but that is better than feeling like a death sentence.

Thank you so much to everyone who offered advice and sympathized and even had harsh words for me deciding to stay.

tl;dr: Left my abusive husband. Life is much better.

EDIT: for those saying it didn’t sound that bad or abusive, you should know it got worse. It did escalate to physical abuse, us sleeping separately/no intimacy for a year. 

If you think you are too old or too much trouble or have too much baggage or are too much anything, please believe that it is possible to find love again. Both loving yourself and having someone else love you 💕",">My future feels uncertain, but that is better than feeling like a death sentence.

Yes! I remember reading once that what human beings are scared of most is uncertainty. So in a way, staying with your abusive husband -- while awful and full of emotional abuse -- was the safe option because you *knew* what you were in for. Leaving him was an act of bravery and I hope your future is full of warmth and love.",7863,89,2019-04-09 18:26:00,bbbfo8
relationships,[Update]I [30f] want to discuss moving in with boyfriend [34m] but we have a significant difference in income.,"OP:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/b820za/i\_30f\_want\_to\_discuss\_moving\_in\_with\_boyfriend/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/b820za/i_30f_want_to_discuss_moving_in_with_boyfriend/)

Thanks for all the advice, I ended up broaching the topic last week.

As mentioned in the first post both my boyfriend and I have been hinting around the topic but hadn't directly discussed it. I was still on the fence about bringing it up myself when my boyfriend made a comment about how he's excited for us to live together (one day). I just responded with, ""Well did you want to? My lease is up in July."" and he said that he did.

It was before work when it happened so we left it at that for the day and got together that evening to work out details. I expressed to him at that point that while I would love living with him that my concern was that I wouldn't be able to contribute equally and I didn't want him feeling taken advantage of. He in turn expressed that he'd never want to put me in a bad position financially and that we could easily figure out something that would be fair while still putting me in a better financial position.

We ended up deciding we'd go with a lump sum monthly that I'll pay to him to cover all the costs, rather than splitting bills. The monthly amount he offered at first I actually upped because I didn't think he was being fair to himself, and it was still less than what I pay now. He seemed happy with that and it definitely works for me!

He keeps mentioning how excited he is to move in together, and came to my apartment last week to help me clean for photos to show it! We're deciding together what we'll keep out of my furniture vs. his, what we'll get rid of and what we're going to store. He's also mentioned a couple renovations he wants to get done around the condo so we're going to go together to pick stuff out and make it a summer project. :)

**TL;DR:** Boyfriend gave me an opening to ask about moving in so I seized it. All went well and we'll be moving in together in June!

**Edit:** Wow... this really blew up! Thanks to everyone for the super kind words. To address the most common comment here; we did discuss splitting proportionally but ultimately decided to go with a lump sum. I definitely see benefits to proportional splitting but for where we are right now and my financial situation I prefer a lump sum. It's still significantly less than what I'm paying now, and it wont fluctuate as the weather changes so I can count on what I owe monthly not changing.

Many people have mentioned chores as well. My boyfriend and I tend to do chores together. I mean right now with two separate places we each have our things that are more our responsibility but when I've stayed with him for a stretch of time we've just balanced together. He doesn't know how to cook but wants to learn so we cook meals together and then clean up together. We will each have our own washroom at his place (I've already taken over the main washroom and he uses the en suite). He volunteers at a local animal shelter once a week so those days I clean and cook if I'm around. But generally speaking we just treat doing chores as an opportunity to spend time together and be productive. :)","Aw, this is adorable!

relationships,Girlfriend (25 f) dislikes my (30 m ) relationship with my baby sister (10 f),"I am very close to my baby sister. We share a father, but not a mother. My dad, is kinda a flighty guy. As a result, I’m more of my sister’s dad than he is. I have her so often that I have a two bedroom condo and every house hunting venture lately considers her.

My girlfriend of six months doesn’t like that she’s always at my house, that she has a room, or that I do her laundry. My girlfriend was putting sheets on my bed and there was a pair of my sister’s underwear that fell out of them obviously tangled in the dryer. She lost it. She was saying our relationship is weird and I have to stop having my sister so much. Honestly, that’s not gonna happen. I love that girl, and I’m basically her dad. So I need advice in telling my probably soon to be ex that.

Tl;dr girlfriend is jealous of the time I spend with my little sister and basically insinuates it’s inappropriate. How do I tell her to chill? More importantly, how do I keep her from telling other people that?

Edit: we did sort of fight when she said that. I told her my sister is the age I was when my mom died and I had to go live with my dad full time. I wouldn’t wish that on any child. She knows my mom died horribly and I think she knows the impact it’s had on me

relationships,UPDATE: I [24F] am at the end of my rope with my wife [27F].,"Hello, everyone.

[I wrote here two months ago about my relationship with my wife.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/c3ms1o/i_24f_am_at_the_end_of_my_rope_with_my_wife_27f/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app) She was a hoarder and had a litany of other issues that were above my pay grade. I asked Reddit if I should leave by July 1, and it was unanimous that I absolutely should.

I didn’t leave July 1.

I left the night of June 30.

The cleaning didn’t get done, surprising literally no one. We were driving to our apartment and I told her that I was really crestfallen about July 1.

“Why? Is that a bad date for you or something?”

I was furious, but kept it to myself. I told her how I felt, and I reminded her of my deadline. I told her that I was moving out and that I was done.

She cried and cried and cried, and begged for a week to clean the apartment to “show that she was committed to this marriage”. I said that she was free to do it, but I wasn’t going to sleep there during that, and I moved in with my friend. We agreed to reassess the condition of the apartment Sunday morning. 

She told me how spiritually edifying it was to clean. I was really optimistic for a bit. 

Wednesday comes and my FIL calls me, frantic. He’s like a dad to me. He tells me that my wife emailed him (which she never talks to him unless she has to), and I asked why. He told me that she begged him to tell me to ‘come back home’. He remarked that it was bizarre, but I was incensed. “No, FIL, it’s not bizarre, it’s shitty. She’s trying to leverage you though our relationship to get me back.”

Saturday comes and she sends me a message on Facebook saying “you know, it doesn’t look as good as I wanted it to physically, but I feel like I’ve made a lot of progress emotionally and *isn’t that what matters?*”

I told her that such progress would have been appreciated two years ago, but I had to walk- I couldn’t do it any more.

She spent money online with our card without informing me on yarn and we had a disagreement about it. I told her that I wanted the bank account closed, but she “couldn’t bear to see me in person”. I redirected my checks to a new account instead.

It had been weeks and I finally went back to get my things and it got a lot worse. There was a water leak in the carpet, the litter boxes weren’t taken care of since I took care of them the day I left, and she managed to move the microwave into her bedroom. The latter was particularly surprising because she refused to move anything heavier than 10 lbs because of a cited rotator cuff injury for years and yet got a 40 lbs microwave into her room.

I reported the conditions to my MIL, who co-signed the lease with us. She called me back to bemoan “what am I going to do about my daughter? You don’t understand how hard it is to have to think about how to take care of her!”

I snapped at MIL about her nonsense. She asked me what she should do about my ex-wife, feeding her histrionic personality. I told her that I had no idea, but she signed papers 27 years ago that made it her responsibility and not mine.

I’m happily living with my friend. Her and I are currently figuring out what we are, but we’re being supportive of each other and making each other lives easier. We both just celebrated birthdays (happy quarter-century!) and that was perfect. 

I’ve been told that my ex-wife has had a much more rigid and stoic affect since I left. MIL told me that she didn’t even say she missed me. “It’d be nice if she came back.”

I heard from FIL that they’re mad that the car I have is in my name; it was given to me as a graduation present, and was an old family car.

I start my new job tomorrow. I’ve been getting ready all last week and I am so nervous but so excited.

I’m really glad I left.

TL;DR: My wife begged me for her last second chance, still didn’t do anything. Tried to get her dad to bend my arm to come back. She wrecked the apartment even more since I left, so I notified MIL. MIL is more concerned about herself than her daughter. I’m happy with my friend and I start my big girl job tomorrow, and thank God.

EDIT: I made this clarification in the comments, but it needs to be said- I was estranged from my friend when I got with my wife. I was disowned for being gay by my family and had to immediately leave college and sought refuge with my ex-wife, and my friend and I fell out of contact. We got into contact again this year when I was interviewing for jobs in the area where she lived, not knowing that she was there. I’m trying to figure out how we’re going to be roommates in the long-term, and for how long, etc. Logistics.","You need to close the bank account you own jointly. If she overdraws and doesn’t pay, you will be just as responsible even if you didn’t make the charges! It only takes one person to close a bank account so you shouldn’t need to get her there.",6994,73,2019-08-25 17:44:25,cvblpb
relationships,UPDATE: How do I [26F] talk to my SO[21M] about needing him to keep my room tidy when he's staying over?,"&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Original post:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8lvvkg/how\_do\_i\_26f\_talk\_to\_my\_so21m\_about\_needing\_him/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8lvvkg/how_do_i_26f_talk_to_my_so21m_about_needing_him/)

&#x200B;

I thought I would update on what’s happened since my post one year ago.

&#x200B;

Shortly after, I chose an appropriate time to talk to R about the situation. I explained how it makes me anxious to come back home to a messy place and would rather keep it tidy as I go, specially if It’s when leaving the house and I’m not late for any commitments.

&#x200B;

I also brought up that I thought it would be good for him to live by himself before we could consider living together. I explained that I used to be very messy when I first moved out of my parents house but with time learned the value of a tidy and clean space in which to feel relaxed. He thought about it and a while after said he thought I was right and he would like to have a go at living by himself, saying he was very excited even thinking about it.

&#x200B;

In the days after the talk his attitude changed completely too. At times I would leave for work and he would stay at my house to do some other chores or come and pick me up earlier and take the bins out. He started spending more time at my house after this and we became much closer in the following months.

&#x200B;

In September R started a new job and for logistical reasons we could not spend the night together unless we were both on a day off the following day (he works Monday-Friday and I work 4 shifts on 4 off). We would go a whole week without seeing each other for more than an hour or two, which was really abnormal for us. We started to make a big effort to meet up at any spare 15 minutes between our jobs and other commitments. Sometimes one of us would drive to the other one after work just to say hi for 10 minutes and then leave. It really showed how much we cared about the relationship.

&#x200B;

Around this time I was looking for a new house as i had a raise at my job and could afford to live somewhere on my own as opposed to a shared house. I went to see a flat that was perfect for me. Ticked all the boxes, including budget. The only thing was that as soon as I saw it all I could think of was how it wasn’t to be just mine but mine and R’s.

&#x200B;

That evening we sat down and I told him about the flat and what I thought as soon as I saw it. I explained how the efforts we had both put in the relationship over the last few months proved to me that we had a relationship worth cherishing. He asked me for some time to think about it and eventually said he too thought we should move in together. R said he didn’t feel like he needed to live alone to “discover himself”. We then sat down and wrote a list of things we would look for in a place, including a budget and how much we would need to spend on furniture, etc.

&#x200B;

**( edit:** this note now hangs in our bedroom wall as a sign of how we dreamed this house, planned it and accomplished it together. )

&#x200B;

By this time I had decided to forget about the perfect flat I saw and we decided to look for another place together. A few weeks go by and the agency calls me to say the flat I had seen a month before was still available and the landlord had lowered the rent. We went to see it and R loved it as much as me.

&#x200B;

Over the last 5 months he has surprised me everyday. He has taken this flat and looked after it in a responsible adult way. R has been busy fixing everything that needed TLC in the house, spent time decorating the bedroom, he even started to cook and now makes delicious meals. His parents visit often and are super proud of him too.

&#x200B;

**We are two happy peas in a happy little flat.**

&#x200B;

Thank you all for your advice.

Special shoutout to /u/baffled_soap for [this comment.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8lvvkg/how_do_i_26f_talk_to_my_so21m_about_needing_him/dzk3jod?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) It made me realise that maintaining a living space is a life skill anyone can learn.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**edit 2:** thank you everyone for all your kind words. I plan to show this post to R when he gets home from work. I should probably add that when friends ask us how living together it's going he says he's the clean one. Cheeky.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: we talked, R respected my space, 5 months after the post we moved in, having the best time in our little beautiful flat.","So happy for you OP! 

Also thanks for sharing to show that what adults should and can do - put effort into making a healthy, sustainable relationship work in the long run.

relationships,UPDATE: I (28F) am getting tired of my bf (28M) getting upset over inoffensive things that I say,"Previous post can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/cvljeo/i_28f_am_getting_tired_of_my_bf_28m_getting_upset/).

Well, Reddit. We broke up. Two weeks after I posted the above, we got into a fight because I was surprised to see him in the kitchen when I had just saw him in the bedroom. I said, ""Oh you're up!"" He responded by rolling his eyes, shrugging his shoulders and demanding, ""Is that a problem?!""

I said ""Of course not, I was just surprised!"" and went on to do the laundry. He left the kitchen and went into the bedroom. He gave me one-word answers when I tried talking to him. I guessed he needed time to himself so I went into the living room to call my friend. As I was talking to her I heard him leave the apartment. 

After I finished talking to her about 20 minutes later, I went out to find him playing Pokemon Go. I tried talking to him like normal and he kept giving me one-word answers, not looking at me. I finally asked him what was wrong. He said nothing. I said to tell me. He said he didn't feel welcome in my apartment because of my ""tone.""

For listeners who heard the previous fights, you'll know my ""tone"" and the ""wordings"" of my sentences were things that triggered him a lot. Even if they were innocent statements like, ""I thought you were traveling on Monday?"" or anything else that somehow threatened him and made him immediately defensive.

Unlike other times, where we would launch into a fight that would last hours or DAYS because he would insist I would have a tone, I would say I didn't mean it that way, and apologize, and it wasn't enough, this time we managed to pass through it fairly unscathed (and due mostly to my patience, if I may say).

But then later that day he told me how annoying my indecision was. That I could never relax. 

That night I wanted to see some friends for a few hours because I had only interacted with him for several weeks at that point and I needed some social time. He said that was fine--he's always said that would be fine (as if I needed his permission). So I went out.

25 minutes away from home and nearly at my destination, he messages me about how he feels lonely, he's going back to his home country soon, he wishes I hadn't gone out, we don't have much time left together, we were supposed to spend the whole day together (this was news to me).

It takes a lot of effort for me to keep down the anxiety and just enjoy time with my friends before going home.

We argue for two hours about it, even though there are several times when I point out he's repeating himself, that HE said he didn't even know he would feel that way so how could I anticipate his needs? It occurred to me that he often would do that--wait until it was too late to change something, complain about it and make it my fault. Like when he accused me of leaving him alone to fend for himself at a party for an hour (it was 15 minutes, I was watching the clock knowing he was insecure and didn't like social gatherings), or that I was with my friend he didn't like the whole time (I talked to my friend for less than 5 minutes the whole night because I had one eye on the clock and the other on my boyfriend). Why didn't he get up and talk to me during the party and tell me that? Why did he wait until the party was over and we were home and he held it over my head? 

Or the time we got back from a tropical island and he says he ""wishes we could have relaxed more,"" when I was the one who planned the trip and was driving and why did it not occur to him to tell me at any time he just wanted to relax somewhere? I thought it was relaxing because he was just in the car talking with me and playing Pokemon Go anyway while I was doing the driving, was it really not that relaxing?

Or that time he was mad at me ALL day because he thought I was mad at him and I had made some remark that he took personally (shock), and he didn't tell me why he was being quiet until hours later and after I pryed and begged for him to tell me.

This kind of shit. All the time, you guys, holy shit.

The day of the reckoning. He finally leaves my country. He's back in his home country. Messages me how he feels like he failed us and he doesn't want to be home. I respond compassionately but say he needs to get rest because he's been traveling so long and hasn't eaten and I wanted to give the discussion of his feelings the time and love they needed and we couldn't when it was 3 AM there and he had to be up for work at 7 AM.

He goes cold. He goes to bed.

He wakes up. Still cold. One-word answers. I'm used to it now.

But now I'm fed up. 

I call him out on his behavior. I tell him I'm sick of him going hot and cold with me. He says I didn't ""comfort"" him the way he wanted me to. I reiterate what I had said. He reiterates that it's not what he wanted to hear. 

We break up later that day. We're both sad. Despite the bad times we had good times too, otherwise it would have been easier to let go. I'm disappointed in myself for saying I still didn't recognize the emotional abuse. I said we could try again. He says we couldn't. We both cry. We both apologize. We both thank each other for the good times.

Next morning. He wakes up. Pissed. Mad I didn't give him a chance. Mad he has nothing to show for our relationship. Mad at all the sacrifices he made.

(Sidenote: after the last fight I posted about, he had said to me: ""I look at all the sacrifices I've made and I wonder, what have you sacrificed? Are you worth it?"" To give you an idea, that is the most hurtful thing anyone has ever said to me, and it was the beginning of the end of our relationship. I opened up my home to him, cooked him vegetarian meals, tried to introduce him to other people so he didn't feel lonely, took him out and explored the country with him, tried to cheer him up, planned all our trips...it was NEVER enough. What was I sacrificing? My time. My energy. My mental health. My personal freedom. My social time with my friends. Everything.)

It was like he always expected the worst in me, and would only ever see what he wanted to see.

So we haven't talked since, after he chewed me up and spit me out and accused me of never listening to his feelings and always blaming him for everything. That I should have told him how I felt sooner, that I should have heard him out on an apology (that he apparently had no intention to actually get better from, just feel bad that it happened at all and repeat the same behaviors as infinitum).
 
If any of this rings true to you...please get out. I started reading, ""Why Does He Do That?"" since I saw it recommended on this sub several times a day. It's opening my eyes to what I put up with. The unhealthy behaviors. The emotional abuse. The mental exhaustion I have suffered.

I won't lie. I miss who he was in the beginning. The sweet guy. The promises. The love. The care. The above-and-beyond romantic gestures. But they had vanished only months into the relationship--after we exchanged I love you's--and then the jealousy came out. The insecurity. Nitpicking what I said and how I said it. Even how I apologized wasn't good enough. His controlling tendencies. He demanded I not talk to my friends about it—even after the break up he asked that I not talk to our mutual friends about our break up. 

I could never make him happy.

Please, please, if you read this and think it reminds you of your relationship...please know you can do better. I am single now and have been the last two weeks, but the moment we broke up I felt relief. I felt a weight being lifted off of me. I have my time again. I can do what I want, when I want, without worrying how he will feel or how he will react or how long our fight will last or trying to manage the anxiety he made me feel.

It can get better. 

Look up “signs of emotional abuse” and click the link with over 60 examples. Google “why does he do that PDF” and just read the first ten pages online. If it resonates with you, then know that you have taken a very essential first step towards a happier, healthier you.

I know I still have some ways to go. I am still trying to convince myself it was an emotionally abusive relationship, that I was not overreacting, that I can't go back, that I can do better, that my future self deserves better, that he was not the one. I had been so sure he was. But I just have to keep trusting my gut. It's hard not messaging him. I feel pathetic for even considering it. I used to be stronger. Maybe I'm still strong. I just have to get it back. Keep practicing. Keep being strong.

Anyway. Thank you for reading.

tl;dr I left my emotionally abusive relationship. Thank you to everyone who messaged and helped me see what he was doing was not okay. Thank you for the brave people who post about their unhappiness with their spouses and helped me see things must be able to get better. For making me feel less alone. Just...thank you. &lt;3

Edit: The overwhelming support. I can’t keep up but I’m reading every comment. Thank you for helping to convince me I’m not crazy. Thank you for sharing your own painful stories. Thank you for reaching out and leaving comments or messages to send hope and love. Thank you for your support. You are all lovely people, and I hope you are all enjoying happy and healthy lives and relationships. Take care of yourselves.","I'm so glad you're out.  Just one piece of advice- do tell your mutual friends.  

Tell the one you're closest to in that group of friends the full story.  Then slowly clue in the others.  Be kind, polite and don't pan him.  Just make it clear that you really tried and it's really sad it didn't work out but he never seemed to be happy with you etc.  Maybe give general indications that there is more to the story.  If they ask further just say you tried hard but it just wasn't enough for him.  Say you hope he can find whatever he's looking for.

Do this because he will absolutely trash you to these people.",6582,219,2019-10-10 08:23:35,dfuy2g
relationships,UPDATE: Boyfriend [25M] wants to break up because I [26F] can't drink,"Original post: https://ud.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/b83384/i_26f_and_my_boyfriend_25m_about_to_move_together/

Long story short, we had a discussion and broke up that week.

Not gonna lie, those first couple months were hard. It felt like the rug had been pulled out from under me and I was totally unsure what to do next. I was torn between sheepishly asking my company to withdraw the transfer, or going ahead and moving alone to what felt like my ex's city. Either way, the clock was ticking on my apartment lease. The anxiety was keeping me up at night and the lack of sleep only made things worse. 

On top of that, it was tough knowing that I was probably the only one sad about the breakup while my ex was living his best life, partying with best friends and banging hot chicks, relieved to be rid of me. So...yeah. That felt like shit.

In the meantime I threw myself into work to keep my mind off things. That's when things took a crazy turn because one of my projects garnered a lot of attention. It led to me writing a report that made its way to a member of upper management. Lo and behold, a few weeks later a management position opened up that I was uniquely qualified for...and the interviewer was that same person who liked my report.

So I got the job! And when they told me that I would need to relocate to our home office in the Bay Area (I work in biotech), I was able to tell them that all my stuff was already packed and ready to go. Thanks, ex!

So now, instead of Dallas, I'll be moving to the Bay Area in a few weeks. One of my best friends is coming along for the ride. We're going to make an epic road trip out of it and hit a few national parks along the way.

Since we had fully expected to move in together, my SO had taken some of my belongings down with him. I've paid about $500 so far to get my shit shipped back. My kitchen stuff and some pieces of furniture are forfeit. He has yet to return my gaming consoles. We really should have split it, but I knew he'd turn that into a back-and-forth that I didn't want to deal with. Tbh, there's also enough of a difference in our budgets that $500 to me is not as big a deal as $250 would be to him. (It's yet another blessing that we never merged our finances.)

I've reminded him a few times about the rest of my stuff and he keeps telling me he'll get it to me. I *really* don't want to have to come down there with a police escort to take back my property, but it's looking like I might have to. I don't know why he has to make this so difficult, but I'm getting pissed. 

So if anyone has any advice to share on that...

I know I'll never know his true thinking, but honestly who cares at this point?

I've also decided I'm not going to try to date for another year at least. I've been told that my management role is likely to be upgraded to a director role, depending on my performance review. So work will probably take up a lot of my time. Any remaining time I have, I want to fully devote to forming friendships. 

But most importantly, if you couldn't already tell, it's clear that I have some serious work to do on self-worth and boundaries.

FTR, I think it's important to note that it's not like this guy was a deadbeat loser. I know it's easy to think, ""Why is this woman dating an asshole?"" when you read these posts, but it's rarely that simple. Everyone who met him loved him. We shared a lot of common interests. He was fun to be around, always happy, great to talk to, supportive of my career, a fantastic cook, very organized, came from a great family, had a good job, all of that.

However, there's no denying that I was in a long-term relationship with someone who consistently took *way* more than they gave. Like, on every level. And he himself would admit that.

I want to take this time to work on myself so that I never accept that kind of situation again.

Buuuuut, when I do decide to put myself out there again, it's the Bay Area. God knows there will be plenty of guys around who also get Asian glow and will understand why I'm not drinking lol

Cheers, everyone! 🥂

**Tl;dr** We broke up. Went through a terrible couple months. Drowned myself in work to cope. Hard work paid off and I landed a major promotion that will take me to the Bay Area instead. Learned an expensive lesson about letting an SO move your things. Hoping he doesn't make me come down there, but I know it's all going to be good in the end. Gonna take the next year to be single and work on myself, but life is looking up.","Perfect example of ""when one door closes, another opens"".",6563,210,2019-08-10 22:24:28,coolef
relationships,UPDATE : my [24f] partner [24m] doesn’t do things unless I specifically ask him to. It’s driving me insane,"[original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/a2c42f/my_24f_partner_24m_doesnt_do_things_unless_i/?st=JS8PE29K&sh=f62389f8)


Hey everyone, I wrote this post just over 2 month ago, and i got a lot of advice and help and thought I should do an update.

I took a lot of your advice. I spoke to him about it again, and said we need to come up for a solution because I couldn’t go on with such little help anymore. 

We wrote a list as someone had suggested . (Sorry I don’t know how to link usernames) and I wrote what I do and he wrote what he did. My list was much bigger than his and he said he didn’t realise How ‘unequal’ the lists were and he thought we were doing pretty much the same. He thanked me for everything I did, and said he’d change.

We take it in turns with the nappy changes and the story times etc and it’s working very well.

Now we have certain things we both need to get done. He will bath the kids on the nights he’s home so he gets to spend more one on one time. He’ll read stories and is being much more involved.

I still do a lot which I’m fine with, (the things SAHP do) but I want to stay home with the kids and do the majority as I feel that’s what I’m happiest with doing. I’m just appreciative of the help he’s now giving me. I don’t feel alone anymore. 

I think with a new baby and a toddler and working full time, it was getting a bit on top of him but we communicate better and when he’s feeling overwhelmed, I’ll do more and vice versa.

I do think I have to ask him some things still, but I feel like that only happens when we have had a bit of a busy/hard day. but we have more of an understanding of one another now. 

We also read the articles commenters recommended and that is definitely in the back of our mind. 

I do feel I got into the habit of doing things myself and would bathe and read, etc without really giving him that time and now I’m encouraging him even more to do things one on one with the kids. As I was always there when he was spending time with them, I’m trying to make it where he actually gets alone time with them as well. As I think that was making him feel like a “secondary “ parent if that makes sense. He has a much better bond with the kids now, and we are all so much happier. As a family and us as a couple. 

I might have missed things so if you wanna know anything else ill answer.
I know this isn’t the most amazing update and it’s just a case of communicating better but you’ve all helped so much and I’m very appreciative. I love reddit!

Thanks for all your comments/advice. 


TLDR : a case of communicating better and following your advice has helped us thanks so much

relationships,UPDATE: My (33 F) roommate’s (29 F) dog is literally killing me,"Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/e3b49g/my_33_f_roommates_29_f_dog_is_literally_killing_me

Thank you everyone so much for your advice. It gave me the confidence boost I needed to go to the higher ups. 

My roommates behavior had progressively gotten worse after posting. She had stopped bathing the dog to protest being fired and kicked out, (also a fuck you to my allergies), she had stopped sorting recycling and started throwing trash away in the recycling bins, taking other people’s food, and several other things that just make you say WTF?! 

I knew after seeing what you guys were saying and seeing that behavior from her, I had to speak up and be so loud that no one could ignore me. I also knew I had to make the hard choice of resigning and moving back home if the company wasn’t going to take my worries seriously. 

Since it is company housing, I demanded a hearing with the company heads and the landlord. 

I took my visit summaries from doctors appointments and told them how this needed to stop and the move out date needed sooner. If that didn’t happen I would be forced to resign. 

They were appalled and they wished I would have spoken up sooner. A mistake I will never make again. They made up a new contract they made her sign pushing the move out date to Jan 25th. 

They also stripped her of some company items (phone & computer) they were going to let her previously keep. She’s going to be banned from company property as well after that date. In addition to all of this, the company will be reimbursing me for any medical bills I have because of the dog allergies. 

I think this is the best outcome I could have gotten realistically. Thanks you guys once again. 

TL;DR update: my roommate got crazier, I went to company heads and landlord, they moved up the kick out date, gave strict sanctions, and are covering any medical bills I have because of it.

relationships,"UPDATE: Apparently, I'm(26F) too perfect for someone like him(28M). Was this the best shutdown ever or is he really that insecure?","[original](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/cysbos/apparently_im26f_too_perfect_for_someone_like/)

I wasn't going to bother linking the original post but I guess I have to. It only attracted the attention of 2 people, one of them probably has a lot of throaways judging by my karma. Still, it's a happy ending and a teachable moment I would love to share with the world.

&#x200B;

In a nutshell- I met a guy I liked, found out there was an incident involving him, ran away cause I lost a close friend to a similar situation and that was too much for me to handle. A year or so later I looked him up to see if he even survived, we got back in touch and became friends. Over the years I caught feelings, he started yet another relationship. He went through a hard time and crashed at my place. We kept living together, he got better emotionally and started showering me with affection. Then I got hit by a drunk diver and got off with no complication and very easy recovery (compared to what could've been in that particular situation). While I was in the hospital he told me the incident left him disfigured. He fixed that, it's barely noticeable, you literally have to know about the remaining scar to see it but he can't stop seeing himself that way. Once I left the hospital, those tiny signs of affection got progressively bigger, to the point there wasn't a moment without physical contact. One night we were cuddled up on the couch and I went for the kiss, he shut me down by saying I'm too perfect to be wasted on someone like him.

&#x200B;

The actual update- The next day I went to work, he pretended last night never happened, I was freaking out cause I wanted to have the talk but didn't want to push it. Had the talk anyway and now we're together. We opened up about a lot of things. He had no idea why I ran away when I found out about the incident. He thought I knew about his injuries and didn't want him like that. I haven't spoken about my friend with anyone but a therapist, I finally told him and he understood. He said he was jumping from relationship to relationship to numb his feeling for me cause he thought I would never be able to love him back. The night I tried to make the move, it was the kiss itself that freaked him out. Turns out that sexy cheeky slightly crooked smile is nerve damage and an ex told him he's the worst kisser in the world. He's not. He's also brilliant in bed. In that one night we became closer than in the past 7 years. And I told him acting like my housewife/babysitter won't fly no more and he toned it down but he still pampers me to an extent. Right now we're like teenagers, glued at the lips, making up for lost time. He was my best friend for so long and I know he's the one for me. This felt like a relationship for months before it even started, now I got the good stuff on top of the perfect partnership we already had. So people, talk to your loved ones ffs! We wasted years beating around the bush, learn from our mistakes.

&#x200B;

TLDR- Communication is vital. Don't be like us, talk to the people you love, no matter how hard it is. Yes, he was that insecure. We're together now and we're making up for lost time. We will work on our issues together.",Yay! Always like a happy update! Hope you both are very happy :),5911,72,2019-09-05 04:57:21,czw9lk

While my original post didn't get a ton of feedback, I thought I'd update. 

About a month after I posted, I asked him for a separation. He agreed. I moved out and I've got my own place now. I thought maybe moving out would be the wake up call that was needed to save the marriage, but it wasn't. However, it turned out to be the best thing for all of us. 

We share custody of our children, and they transitioned to public school and are doing very, very well. 

I'm doing pretty well, too. It's been hard - and there have been a lot of ups and downs, but it's been worth it. We're all so much happier now, and my ex and I are working really well together to co-parent our kids and we're even friends. We'll always be there for each other, but we're better off apart. 

Not the happy ending that I was hoping for, but a happy ending nonetheless.

Thank you to everyone who took the time to give me advice. I finally saw him last weekend for the first time in about seven weeks (he invited me over). He seemed happy to see me at first, but things just seemed a little...off. Like we didn't know what to say to each other.

I stayed with him on the Saturday night. Had a shower Sunday morning and the first thing I saw was a bottle of camellia-scented body scrub that was definitely not mine and I can't remember ever seeing it before. He lives alone. INSTANT RED FLAG. Stupidly I didn't confront him about it straight away, I wish I had.

Over the next couple of days I tried to make conversation with him and he either left me on read or sent really short replies. Finally, on Wednesday night I'd had enough - and I'm not proud of how I acted but I was so hurt by the anxiety and the pain of feeling rejected - I blocked him on Facebook without any warning.

The following afternoon, I got a text message *""Hey, ummm...so did you block me?""*

I responded:  
*I did. I give up. Life's too short to be someone's afterthought.*  
*Whether you've just lost interest or whether there's somebody else (when you jump in the shower on a Sunday morning and see girly body scrub that isn't yours, you gotta wonder), or both, I really don't care. I deserve better and it's not worth feeling like a dirty little secret and feeling like shit when I could be happy by myself, or go find someone who lifts me up and genuinely wants to be in my life and vice versa. I'm angry at myself for letting this drag out for so long. I should have let go ages ago but I guess I hoped that things would get better. More fool me.*

Haven't heard from him since so I guess the trash took itself out! He clearly didn't care about me at all. I'm 31 tomorrow, looks like I'll be spending it free and single! 

TL;DR - saw partner for first time in 7 weeks, things seemed off, found girly body scrub in shower that didn't belong to me, saw red, blocked him on social media. Now single.","Good riddance, and cheers to new beginnings!",5659,125,2019-09-28 07:31:25,dacyra
relationships,My (F22) boyfriend (M31) of three years won’t stop using dating apps. I think it’s time for me to leave.,"Since we met my boyfriend has been on and off of tinder, I’ve been very clear that it hurts me but he always defended it as just him ‘wanting an ego boost’. A few months ago we had a major argument about it where I threatened to leave and I honestly thought that was going to be the end of it. Pretty naive, really. Also I should note his ex before me left him for this very reason- I feel like an idiot for thinking he’d ever change.

Today I woke up and realised he’d been using my phone and his email was logged in. I noticed he’d gotten an email from an app called hinge- just to give you an idea of the kind of app this is, the description read: ‘the app that was designed to be deleted’. Great. My stomach instantly dropped. I logged into it with his phone number and he’s put up profile pictures of him that I’ve taken when we’ve been on days out together?! In his description he’s got things like ‘we’ll get along if you like Chinese and have a dog, if you’re silly and comfortable and over share’. He’s also put in as a strict preference that he wants to be matched with hindus/muslims only. I’m white british.

I knew something was going on yesterday but wasn’t sure what, he was acting differently and it was making me so anxious. He had the nerve to tell me that I must just be hormonal? I think the worst part about it is his reaction to all of this- he heard me crying, acted concerned and then saw me with his phone, at which point he just took it from me and went back to bed. That was about an hour ago and the only interaction I’ve had with him since was him asking me to open the bathroom door... not to see if I was okay, but because he needed to pee. This post sounds like a joke at this point.

I’m obviously hurt by the fact that he’s on this thing but I think I’m more shocked by his total lack of guilt or response to me being upset. I’m so angry and there’s nothing I can do with it- I’m so embarrassed about the situation I don’t want to tell my family/friends how he’s treated me, and I can’t even talk to him about it because he’s refusing to address anything’s wrong, he’s still in bed. I don’t know what to do. He’s brought my self esteem down so much that I feel like I can’t be without him, but I know i can’t stay in this situation. Should I even bother trying to talk to him or should I just leave? I’ve taken screenshots of everything and initially I was going to send them to his family but thought against it. The thing is, if I just leave there’s literally zero consequences for him. He gets what he wants, he gets the freedom to go on random dates with no guilt. It just seems so fucking unfair that I’m the one left heartbroken and he gets to party up.

I know the majority of replies are going to tell me to leave, and I can’t argue with you there. But how do I quell this need for closure/revenge?

TLDR: caught my boyfriend of three years on another dating app, he’s refusing to even acknowledge the fact that I’m upset. Don’t know what to do.

&#x200B;

Edit-**UPDATE:** So within the hour after I'd initially written this post I got myself and my stuff together, packed it in my car and left. It felt impossible, there was a lot of stuff and I was a wreck but I managed it in the end. Throughout the whole time, he was just in bed pretending to sleep, which made me angry more than anything. I felt like he couldn't care less. We'd been living together for two years but fortunately, in September I'd decided to get my own student apartment- obviously, I knew then that things weren't going well and thank god I made that decision because now I have a place to stay. Whilst I was sat on the driveway in my car ready to leave I got a text from him saying 'I'm not going to insult you by asking you to stay or to come back but could you please leave the keys to the house'. I had already left them, but that last dig at me made me so mad and hurt. No apology, no goodbye just 'leave the keys'. I guess that's my closure. 

&#x200B;

So currently I'm just sitting in bed with my stuff all around me in bags reading through these comments, and have been for the last couple of hours. Thank you for the support, even the comments that were harsh I greatly appreciate- it just gave me a wake-up call and a kick up the ass to sort my life out. I'm sad that this shitshow of a relationship has come to an end, angry that it happened the way it did- but funnily enough, I'm relieved. I can do what I want now and get on top of my self-esteem issues. I'm driving down to see my mum and the rest of the family tomorrow, I haven't seen them since Christmas and I absolutely cannot wait. The anger's still there, but I'm just going to get on with things. I absolutely cannot waste any more energy on that guy. 

&#x200B;

Any advice for my newly single life/getting him out of my head?","Revenge? Your best revenge will be when he’s still browsing date apps while you are in a new, respectful and serious relationship.

You know boyfriends don’t normally have casual internet hookups? They stay faithful and true. 
He’s also a lot older than you. 31 year old men usually have more goals than “ego boosts” from women online.

relationships,[Update] (M33) ignores my overt physical boundaries (F32),"This sub has really changed my life.  I don't know how to express my gratitude, but hopefully this update will let you all know what you do here really matters.

When I started seeing M, I became obsessed with this subreddit.  I would read it several times a day.  Part of me knew what was happening wasn't right, but I felt like I needed outside perspective.  

My mother told me growing up to never speak ill of your partner.  So I lied to my friends and even my therapist about what was happening.  I thought it was wrong to say anything bad about M.  I only posted anonymously here.

I needed to read a lot of stories and hear a lot of comments before I understood relationships aren't supposed to be like what I had with M.  I would read a story and see dozens of commenters call a relationship abusive when that hadn't been my takeaway.  It made me realize I might not recognize what abuse is.

I started researching abuse and learned that name calling, threatening suicide, isolation from friends and family, and telling you no one else will ever love you are abusive behaviors.  I know some people will say that's obvious, but it was so much less abusive than what I saw growing up that I thought it was fine.

I opened up to my therapist and she confirmed that all of these behaviors I thought were acceptable were abuse.  I broke up with M.

It was terrifying to learn that I have literally no clue what a healthy relationship is.  But it probably saved my life.  I was with a man who CHOKED ME IN PUBLIC and I thought the problem was me.  I can't imagine what might have happened if I'd stayed.

My therapist and I are working on medicating my PTSD and exploring what healthy romantic relationships look like.  I'm having a hard time unpacking the abuse because I'm still learning what abuse is, but I'm talking openly and honestly.

Thank you, Reddit.

relationships,"My (28F) colleague (30F) didn't invite me to her wedding, and it's completely unravelled our friendship","One of my work colleagues is a lifelong friend of mine. We lived on the same street growing up, went to the same school and when I needed a job after graduating university, she made me aware of an opening at the company she worked at. I applied, got the job, and it's been quite a few years since and we still work together.

It's a pretty small company, and quite male-dominated, so after we started working together we became really close. We take all our lunches together, we regularly stop by each other's desks for a chat, and we quickly became known round the office as inseparable.

A year ago she got engaged to her long term partner, and I was ecstatic for her. She had a really tough time a couple of years ago (two family deaths close together) and I did everything I could to be a good friend to her while she was in the worst stages of grieving. She cried with me daily for weeks and I made sure she knew I was always available to listen. I also took about a third of her workload off her voluntarily, so she could take days off when she needed to without stressing about her work building up. So now that life has gotten better for her and she's always smiling and excited, it's really nice to see.

Ever since she got engaged, as expected, she's talked a lot about wedding plans, especially at our lunches. I know basically every detail. When she booked her venue she was really excited, but she refused to tell me where it was going to be, saying that she wanted it to be a surprise when the invitations came out.

The wedding is two weeks away now, and I've long since stopped waiting for my invitation to show up. I know when they were sent because she told me all about delivering them, and shows me every day the gifts people have started to buy off their registry.

I feel silly for saying it, but the more I think about it, the more hurt I feel that I haven't been included. It's a big wedding, and she has invited some other people from work that I didn't know she was even close to. She hasn't mentioned the reason why I'm not invited, and at this point I feel too awkward to ask. I guess it's just a slap in the face because I really thought we were close, and now I'm realising that maybe we're not.

The trouble is, since all this I've started to really examine our friendship, and I'm wondering if she even cares about me at all. I can think of a hundred examples of where I've helped her work through decisions, listen to her vent, stood up for her when she's had issues with colleagues etc. Even tons of little things, like if anyone brings in cake and she's out of the office I always save her a slice so she doesn't miss out. But I can't remember a time that she did anything for me in return.

Now when she talks to me, I've realised she doesn't even listen to me. When I'm finished talking she just carries on with what she was saying before, almost as if I'd never spoken at all. If we're ever talking about me or something I've been doing, she never has anything to say. She just kind of nods and then switches the conversation back to herself.

I'm starting to think she couldn't care less about me, she just likes having someone around who she can talk at, and whoever that person is doesn't really matter to her.

I've invested so many years into this friendship, it's really cut me deep. I feel used. It's also made being at work incredibly lonely, because she was my only friend.

I've stopped having lunch with her and any time she tries to chat I politely bring the conversation to a quick end and go back to work. She doesn't appear to have even noticed.

I do still wish her well, I'm still glad for her that life has turned around and she's so happy, but I'm a bit lost. I'm not sure if I'm being too harsh because I'm hurt, or if I even have the right to feel hurt in the first place, as I know weddings have a finite number of guests and you have to leave people out that you would invite in an ideal world.

But I'm not sure there's any way back from this either. Has anyone else had a similar experience? Am I being unreasonable or overdramatic? Should I just let the dust settle and see how I feel then?

Edit 1: Just to clarify things that have been asked a lot or requested to be put in an edit - 1) She hand delivered the invites to other people at work so I know it hasn't been lost in the post 2) I haven't asked her about it because I'm a total doormat and scared of difficult conversations and 3) I invited her to my wedding, but that was years ago so it's possible she thinks things have changed since then.

Edit 2: This has got a lot more attention than I expected, and my first ever gold from a kind stranger, thank you!

I have read every single comment, thank you all so much for taking the time to give me advice. You have given me A LOT to think about.

Opinion seems to be divided over whether or not I should confront the wedding invitation issue or just let it go. I am definitely going to make sure that it isn't a mistake, but as for getting an explanation why she didn't invite me I'm undecided. I'm going to have a think about that and the best way to proceed, but your thoughts have all been really helpful.

In terms of our friendship in general, I'm not going to be too hasty to write it off. I'm going to try and put my feelings aside and see if I'm right about it being one-sided. If it is then I will have learned a good life lesson, and if I see it as worth saving then I'll have to deal with that the best way I can.

It does seem the bigger issue here is my non-confrontational approach to my relationships. Some of your comments were hard to read but only because I know you're right and this is something I have to change. I've withdrawn from friendships before because they've hurt me and I've felt unable to say anything, and that's not really fair.

It's a general problem I have with uncomfortable conversations. Whenever I have to have them I basically descend into a panic, my mouth goes dry, I shake and I can't find the right words to say. If it's a bad enough problem that I can't ask a good friend a simple question then I can't ignore it any more and I need to work on this. Thank you for pointing this out to me as a real problem, I'm going to find a way to get better at it.

I will post an update of what happens, thank you again!

TL;DR My best work friend didn't invite me to her wedding, and since then I've started to question our entire friendship. I think it's permanently damaged everything we had, and I'm feeling really hurt, lost, and unsure of how to proceed.","Why don’t you ask her why you didn’t get an invite? If you thought of her as one of your close friends, seems like it would be worth the effort.",5420,207,2019-04-13 18:44:51,bctq5b

&#x200B;

I spoke to my bf the day after I responded to a lot of you. I decided I was going to talk to him one more time and set a boundary about these 'jokes' or tell him I wasn't moving in with him and that maybe we need to reevaluate the relationship. I told him I wanted to have a serious discussion and he immediately asked if I wanted to break up with him because he figured it was coming. I was taken back because I didn't expect that reaction. I didn't say anything at first, but then I told him that I wanted to talk to him about his jokes and, honestly, his behavior in general when it comes to people and making fun of them in such a mean way, especially when they ask him to stop. I also did a little reading on verbal abuse and abuse in general and things were a lot more clear. 

So, he listened to me and then told me that he didn't like people trying to ""change him"" and that his last girlfriend had tried to do the same and she couldn't accept him for who he was; he thought I would be different because I was more understanding and fun. I'll admit, that is probably one of my flaws, that I try to understand everyone's position about most things and give them far too many chances, there are exceptions, but for the most part, I will try to understand someone and work with them on it. I asked him if she, his ex, and the overweight friend were the only ones who had left him over this behavior and he told me that he'd lost a lot of friends and dating was hard because women tended to cut out pretty quickly, again, in his words, because people are too sensitive and want him to change how he is. He seemed very stuck on being accepted as he is and angry about people trying to change him. I changed direction and asked him if he actually thought anything was wrong with what he said, I used my experiences, specifically, and told him about how I felt when we were looking at places and he said what he said to the potential landlords. He, of course, said they were jokes and that he'd never think less of me because of how much money I made because he kind of figured I didn't make a lot because of how I tended to do things. I asked him to elaborate and he said how I was always on things like Groupon or using coupons at stores or wanting to go out when places had specials or something and he was never around anyone who needed to do that type of thing. So, I told him that I did think he has a problem with people who earn less and don't live a similar lifestyle to him and that, maybe, he just didn't see it. That, sometimes, we are trying to be ""good"" because we have these thoughts of how we should be on the surface and we try to follow them, but when it's more close to home, our real feelings come out because we're faced with it more and I told him that was okay, but that I didn't think it would work for us, that he might be more comfortable with someone who makes the same amount as him and can contribute how he'd like. He interrupted me and told me he didn't want someone like that because he couldn't be himself around someone obsessed with money and material things (not what I said, btw); that they'd be too concerned with money and he liked me because I wasn't that way. I kind of ignored that, but it kind of told me that he either doesn't want someone who has as much ""power"" in the relationship as he has or he thinks women who want more/expect more of him are gold diggers or someone trying to take advantage in some way, I don't know. Anyway, I continued and told him that even if he felt they were just jokes, they were wearing on me and my self esteem and I couldn't live that way. I also told him that it's natural for people to not want to change when they've been a certain way for a long time and so it seems right to us, but that change can be good; that maybe therapy could be good at helping with that. I told him that it's wonderful to be accepted for who you are, but if who you are is, well, jerk-ish, people are a lot less likely to accept you unless they are also jerks and nothing good can come from a bunch of jerks getting together because they'll be toxic to other people, as well as to each other, and I told him I think he's better than that, that he deserves much better. That any woman he truly loves deserves much better than being verbally abused and made to feel like they aren't his equal or worthy.

He sat there and didn't say anything for a while, just looked at me and sighed a lot. He finally said he was disappointed in me for wanting to abandon him because he thought we were true soulmates and he couldn't believe I was saying such abusive stuff about him. I was shocked he was calling me abusive because I didn't think I was being abusive by telling him why I don't want to continue if this is how he will act and that the way he acts is not, well, good. Maybe I went a little far in saying anything about a future girlfriend, but I guess I wanted to impress on him that, if his friends and partners keep leaving because of this behavior, everyone will keep leaving. The only partners willing to stay will be someone who dishes it just as well as they take it, and he knows he's actually very sensitive and wouldn't like that or it'll be someone who lacks any self esteem and he'll make her feel even worse about herself until she breaks down. Like, I could feel myself getting to that point and that's why I'm so angry and frustrated. Not only with the fact that he was now turning all this around to me being abusive, but that he still didn't really seem to get what I was saying about my feelings; it made me realize, yes, I need to leave this situation and I do feel bad about it because I do feel like I'm abandoning him, but at the same time, it just doesn't seem like my feelings or anyone's, are important to him, so why should I stay with someone who doesn't seem to get that his behavior isn't exactly such that gets people to stay in his life? I realized I probably wasn't going to get to him and the conversation itself had me shaking because I was upset and disappointed, myself. However, looking back, I could see signs that this is who he is, other people's feelings just don't mean a lot to him and doing some soul searching, I realize that I, stupidly, thought he would change over time, but waiting on that is wearing on me and our last conversation tells me that he doesn't see anything wrong with what he does, so it's unlikely he will change. 

He didn't seem interested in saying anything else besides that he was sorry I felt the way I did. I told him that I thought we needed to give up on things and find someone better for ourselves elsewhere. He didn't say anything, so I just left. A few hours later I got a confusing text from him telling me that he ""hadn't seen who I was and that I had abusive tendencies"". I didn't respond and just blocked him on everything. I'm sad things ended the way they did, but it was probably for the best. I'll either be good alone or I'll find someone who I work better with. And I want to give a huge thank you to everyone who commented on my last post and sorry if I didn't get back to anyone. I've been quite torn up over this, even though it was my decision. I miss him more as a friend than a partner, but I don't think being friends would work out too well, either, so I'm just leaving it. 

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Tried to have a talk with my bf, didn't go well, so we broke up. Oh well.","When he started saying *you* were the one being abusive, I got scared for a second that you'd believe him. 

I think he told himself you are the abusive one, so that he doesn't have to accept responsibility for the breakup in his own mind. 
""She suddenly became abusive! I was just being myself!""

In any case, good job on getting out of there. This guy had issues and wasn't willing to better himself.",5325,229,2019-09-28 04:07:04,dab8yj

As it turns out, the guy I was seeing found the Reddit post, clicked that it was me, and talked to me about it. Turns out he actually felt the same way in terms of low intensity but he liked that, and I decided to keep dating him for as long as we kept having fun together. 

Well, I’m happy to say that last week we celebrated being together for six months, and that we are quite madly in love with each other :) 

After we talked I took the advice of some of the commenters and tried to just enjoy my time with him instead of worrying about the depth of my feelings. I soon realised that he’s a kind, thoughtful, intelligent person and we totally get each other. He makes me laugh with the most inane stuff and he thinks my dumb jokes are funny too. We can talk for hours and hours about anything at all and I rarely feel like I have to justify or explain my point of view at all - he just understands me. One of the first times I knew I was really falling in love, we were chatting in bed, and suddenly it was 3 in the morning and I realised we’d been chatting for three hours without a single awkward pause. I’ve rarely had that with anyone else, and never with a previous boyfriend. 

I think most of the commenters were right. My other longest relationships were all built around toxic intensity and wild passion, and while this relationship definitely isn’t lacking in the bedroom, I’d say it’s much more built on a sort of close friendship and respect for each other. It’s certainly not as filled with longing and deep passion as other relationships I’ve had, but honestly I prefer being with him. I feel like I have not just someone to go out with or to cuddle up to, but a genuine life partner - somebody who supports me, who I can talk to about anything, someone who makes me want to be a better person. It just took me a while to realise how much better that calmer, more peaceful love is instead of the rollercoaster/intensely toxic relationships, and I almost made the mistake of thinking that it was boring and throwing it away. I really just needed time to get used to dating someone who doesn’t play games and displays his affection openly and frequently. 

We did have some slight issues with communication to start with - mainly me being afraid to bring issues up/suggest things because of other boyfriends overreacting terribly in the past - but after we talked a lot he’s been very supportive and proven himself to be a mature enough adult that he can handle occasional criticism without getting super defensive. It’s been really refreshing to be in such a drama-free relationship where we can argue or talk about issues in a really healthy way. 

Thank you to everyone who replied - you all helped a lot and I’m really glad I took your advice and didn’t just break up with him. I love him a lot and I can see us being together a long time. Thanks :) 

**TL;DR:** Turns out I just needed to adjust to a healthy relationship. Boyfriend is great and we love each other a lot. Everything is awesome, basically.","5 years ago I started to date a guy and felt like you did in the beginning. 2 days from now we are getting married!

The thing is that the excitement it lacked in the beginning came later and I keep falling deeper and deeper in love him! Now I feel butterflies when he texts me and get all excited getting home from work to see him.",5291,93,2019-07-31 18:25:41,ckccmq
relationships,Update: My [25 M] boyfriend’s [26 M] anxiety comes out severely during intimacy.,"Original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/am3mwy/my_25_m_boyfriends_26_m_anxiety_comes_out/). 

I'd like to begin by thanking everyone who left some input; I was overwhelmed by the response. Just know that I did read every single comment.

It hasn't been very long at all; I know that. And I truly don't know what the future holds. But here's what has happened in the past ten days or so. 

I admit, I should have talked to Charlie earlier before heading ""to bed"" again, but I was embarrassed about broaching the subject and still ruminating over the advice. 

And so, his anxiety flared again during sexy time that night. Rather than immediately falling into comforting him, I began asking him why he was feeling like he was and resisting the instinct to ""make it all better.""

It was a little more tough love than I've ever been with him (and we haven't been together all that long), but it got him to open up. 

I did flat-out tell him (in a nice way) that this was getting in the way, that we had to solve this sooner rather than later, and that I didn't like him accusing me of being untruthful in-bed. 

And he responded to that, apologized, and agreed that we could not go on like this.

What actually started coming up as we talked were some things I hadn't considered. 

He was tired at the end of work, distracted by stresses from earlier in the day, finding it challenging both physically and mentally to stay focused and creating this self-fulfilling prophecy, where the fear of being distracted and unable to be a satisfying partner was doing just that.

He was also very embarrassed to not be in the mood sometimes, and I do think that was tied in to the ""failure"" mindset. If he didn't feel like getting going, he was failing me as a partner. I asked him to be open with that.

I also told him that we didn't have to go all the way every time if there were other ways to enjoy the moment. 

And then on to concrete solutions. 

Long story short, Charlie and I have spent the last ten days or so just relaxing together at night and reserving early mornings for intimacy (thanks, /u/NerdWithoutACause). Less stress, less fatigue, and it's been a rather amazing physical solution.

No anxiety flares yet on this revised schedule, when we can do it first-thing and not be under the stress of a long day. But time will tell if this will keep up, I suppose.

Charlie did have therapy three days ago, and he allowed me to look at the notebook he had brought with him. 

He'd brought this all up, and there were some more ""in the moment"" solutions for when his anxiety flared. He's been very open about making the greater effort to control his symptoms on his own without relying exclusively on me.

Waking up to him this morning, he also rather bashfully told me he was feeling under the weather and would prefer if we just cuddled. So we did. And other PG-13 stuff eventually came. It was nice, and I think I have hope.

tl;dr: Resolved to stop comforting boyfriend in bed when his anxiety flared, and realized that outside stressors were part of his flares. We do it in the morning now when there are less of those stressors, and he's working harder in therapy and being more vocal about what he's feeling in the moment. I'm a happy camper for now. 


",This is an excellent update. You're a great partner.,5273,43,2019-02-10 21:15:10,ap8ipb
relationships,[UPDATE] My (20M) friend (22M) wants me to “step aside” so he can date my not-girlfriend (18F),"Original post summary: I have been in an exclusive relationship with (called “L” in post) for over 3 years, but we didn’t use titles (bf/gf). Friend (“K” in post) that knows the history of our relationship asked me to “step aside” so he could try to date L.

[link to original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ckqgjc/repost_my_20m_friends_22m_wants_me_to_step_aside/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)

I wanted to thank everyone that took the time to respond to my post and update anyone who might be interested in the outcome.

I have been staying with L for about a week now, since the initial confrontation with K and thanks to people here, I was sure I wanted to ask her if she wanted to make things more official. She ended up making things even easier for me, as luck would have it. L asked me if it might make things easier if I just told K that she was my girlfriend. I jumped on that opportunity and asked if I could tell everyone she is my girlfriend, and she said yes! She and I are going to look at a few apartments this week, since I obviously need a new living situation, and we want to move in together.

K and I had a few brief discussions after he told me he wanted to be with L. I had told her everything K had said to me, and she was not the least bit interested in him, which I had assumed. I also told him that she is officially my girlfriend now, so that should satisfy his concerns about me not committing to her. He refused to believe any of it without confirmation from her, in person, without me around. She initially agreed to meet with him on Sunday, with the plan that they would meet at her house (since she lives with her mom and stepdad), but he rejected that, saying he wanted to meet at the apartment, without me there. She told him she wasn’t comfortable with that, if he wanted to meet up without me or her parents there they at least had to be somewhere public. He got pissed that his threatening behavior made her feel threatened and went on a tirade, called her every name in the book. She told him she wasn’t going to see him again at all and blocked his number. He has tried reaching out to me a few times ranging from sad to aggressive, and I’m about a text or 2 away from blocking him as well. Hopefully he’ll just move on and it won’t come to that.
Again, thank you to the posters who helped me navigate this situation!

TL;DR- L is now officially my girlfriend and we are going to move in together. K made unreasonable requests when L agreed to discuss their friendship, then blew up at her, so she ended up blocking him.

EDIT:  To clarify, we both wish him well, but neither of us want to continue a friendship with him under any circumstances. Since posting this I have also blocked him. I agree with posters that there is no point in keeping any lines of communication open anymore. I have also reached out to some friends to help get the rest of my stuff out, but I was already able to get everything important when I first left. He can make a shrine out of my old shirts if he really wants.","Dude, this guy is a creep and it sounds like he wanted to do something bad to L when they were alone tbh. Just cut him out of your life.",5269,96,2019-08-06 15:07:32,cmrrhv
relationships,"My birth parents (60s?m, 60s f) who bailed on me (30sf) are flaunting my success around town. How do I get these fools to shut their traps without bringing attention to it or sounding like a drama queen?","Hi, my brother (a year older) and myself were products of an affair. They wanted my brother. 

My father stayed married and my mother took off with my brother leaving me with friends as a toddler. She says it was because I was ugly. Father informed but not interested when I went into foster care and I stayed there until I found out who they were at 18. I've read the court papers as to my foster care.  They just didn't want me. My childhood was horrific. My father maintained contact with my mother and brother. 

I have always lived 30 minutes away at most from my birth parents in the same area. 

My grandmother was coincidentally my neighbour. She found out who I was through gossip and would send photos of me growing to my birth parents as a joke. She knew about the abuse and did nothing. She's dead. 

I left 'home' at 17 was homeless and have done everything myself. My full and half siblings from both sides have been well looked after by my parents. 

At 18+ I reached out to them and my father was remarried and made plans to see me repeatedly he never showed up for. He said it would upset his new family.  My mother had a lot more children and had forgotten about me really. I contacted them when I had my son and that was it and I heard nothing back.  

UNTIL. I've been in the media a fair bit and my friends have told me that my parents have been bragging about me and taking credit for how I look and my successes.  My mother's side of the story is now that I was cruelly ripped from her breast and forced into foster care. She compares herself to the irish homes of unwed mothers and forced adoptions. Oh WOE IS HER. My father is now an example of the injustice of the court system against fathers and how this is just further proof!  Oh WOE IS HIM. 

They talk about how I look like so and so and that I wouldn't be here without them. That my nieces and nephews Ive never met are 'just like me' and how I should give them the same opportunities I have had in my career. How that's what we do for 'family'. How I need to 'grow up' and get past it. 

I blocked contact after they wanted things, but this nonsense spreads easily and I am sick of being whispered about.  I don't want anything off them, I want to be left alone. They want me to meet their other grandkids at parties and they've apologised for the govt/family/god possibly/ the great spaghetti monster keeping us apart.

If I contact them it is further fuel for the fire. If I don't stand up for myself I look heartless and cruel. 

I don't want to leave just yet as my son is finishing school soon, I just want them to stop. 

Any advice?

tl:dr parents terrible taking advantage of my successes how to stop them.","Do a Mariah: ""I don't know them.""

You wouldn't be lying, you only share genetic material with these people, that's about it. If you are asked for your opinion, you can honestly state that you were raised through foster care, because your biological parents made different choices and you worked your way up from a disadvantaged position alone. Be factual. They can share their perspective, you can share your own. He said/she said, but you're the owner of your side. As the person who's achieving things in the media, your story will be more emphasized.",5214,176,2019-07-05 08:15:52,c9dg8e
relationships,[UPDATE] my (23f) bf (28m) checks out EVERY SINGLE WOMAN,"[original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/b9aeqt/my_23f_bf_28m_checks_out_every_single_woman/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)

Hi! So this wasn’t a terribly popular post but I just wanted to share the happy ending. 

The evening after I wrote this post, I went over to his house after work and we hung out and ate and stuff. While we were just laying on the bed, he faced me and said “baby, there anything I can do to be better for you?”. It was the perfect opportunity to share how I felt about that. So I just went ahead and said “idk if you know you still do this but you check out a lot of people when we’re out together. Mostly woman and I worry that it sexualises them and it makes me uncomfortable.” He seemed a little fake surprised and was like “really? Oh I didn’t know I did it so much and so obviously.” I didn’t want to push the agenda so much because I know he’s a thinker and will think about it even if we don’t discuss it further.

The next day, we were on our way back to his house and there was a girl walking towards us who was quite beautiful. I saw him glance at her then he turned and looked at me and I was already looking at him and we both burst into laughter. I said to him that I see that he’s struggling and we just laughed it off but he very clearly got the message because since then I haven’t seen any overt staring at both men and women.

Thank you to everyone who gave me to confidence to deal with this head on.

TLDR managed to speak to my bf about this issue and I’ve seen effort from him dealing with him","Unfortunately we all notice attractive people, but it’s all in how you react to it. It sounds like he’s more aware of it and if he can be more aware that a few moments of checking someone out is not worth the insecurity you will feel, then I think you’ll be all right!  

I really like how receptive he was to this though. This is a good sign for future communication! My husband and I have been together eight years and have had to have some uncomfortable conversations but it’s all in how you approach it and how you react to their response.",5168,85,2019-04-12 08:55:36,bcbbn7
relationships,"UPDATE:My step sister (20F) texted me (21M) last night asking why we aren't close anymore and I said its because how bad we treated each other growing up, should I feel bad for not wanting to be close with her?","After our text convo that led to my dad calling me asking whats wrong between us I texted her about a meet up at my place.  This was the first time we actually met/hung out outside of a family gathering.  Before she came over that realization gave me a new look on our relationship.  The whole sit down went well, we actually got along and there wasn't any name calling or anything ""mean"", we talked about how we treated each other and this was the first time I've ever heard her apologize for how she treated me growing up and I did the same.  We talked about how the text convo went, and I came to the conclusion that I still had the old image of how she was when I last saw her at 17 and was using that to picture her now.  She still kinda acts the same (kinda moody but can hold it in so much better now) but its a lot better.  We talked it out and spent about half the day together just hanging out and I will admit I enjoyed it.  I don't think we will be super duper close but its a step in the right direction and there isn't a wall of tension between us anymore.

Thank you all for the advice and comments it really came in handy and I appreciate it!

TL;DR: Me and my sister talked it out and it went pretty well.

relationships,Update: How do I [32F] protect my work relationships from a bad nepotistic hire?,"[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/cziqqi/how_do_i_32f_protect_my_work_relationships_from_a/)

Since my story got way more interest than I anticipated, I thought I'd give an update.

The CEO didn't want to talk to me about Donna and I didn't bring it up in the meeting a few weeks ago. However, everything kind of came to a head last week when Gavin started telling other people on the team that a few of us, including me, were making his wife feel awkward. I think some of the original commenters predicted this would happen, albeit in a slightly different way. He didn't tell me directly and I found out from the other people who had been accused.

I then decided to talk to the CEO about Gavin. \*I didn't mention Donna or her work quality\* but I wanted his advice and input on whether I was making anyone uncomfortable. I also gave my side of the story, focusing on how the accusation dampened my morale and pointing out that I feel like outsider sometimes since most people in the company are old friends. Fortunately for me, he didn't see things the same way Gavin did and said he would speak to him.

After the meeting, the CEO quietly took Donna off my projects and reassigned her something small and not really connected to the core business objectives to work on. He's also now interviewing someone from outside the friends and family circle to take on the lion's share of what Donna was originally assigned to do. Gavin has been told to provide more direct support for Donna, which he seems annoyed about but obviously isn't going to fight.

TL;DR: I'm lucky my CEO is a wise dude. All in all I think this is a good and fair outcome for everyone, though things with Gavin and I will almost certainly get worse.

Thanks for all the advice in the original post.

OMG thanks for the gold kind stranger!",That's an awesome outcome. Although how Donna still has a job in any capacity boggles my mind,4705,19,2019-09-19 09:51:34,d6brma
relationships,"[UPDATE] Stepmom(45F) acts like I'm(19F) the ""other woman""","Original post: [https://ud.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6o8r2i/stepmom45f\_acts\_like\_im19f\_the\_other\_woman/](https://ud.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6o8r2i/stepmom45f_acts_like_im19f_the_other_woman/)

&#x200B;

Two years after posting this, I can safely say that my family is irreparably fractured. My relationship with my Dad is never going to be the same; in fact, there may not even be a relationship. My younger step-brother (7) has been largely poisoned against me by his Mom. My sister (19) mostly stays away from my Dad's home because it is so uncomfortable. My other sister (14) feels the need to create even more drama, just so she can get a scrap of attention. It has gotten so unbearable that I don't even feel sane anymore.

&#x200B;

When I wrote my last post, I really thought there was a solution to my stepmom's behavior. I had many calm discussions with my Dad where we talked about how damaging stepmom's behavior is. Over time those discussions have gotten more heated and mean. We had gone over it over and over and over to the point that I feel like a broken record. Every time we talked about the issue, he would acknowledge that her behavior is terrible (not in those words because he can't say anything bad about her) and tell me that he didn't know why ""she is like this"".

&#x200B;

I'd ask him why she never liked me over and over again. ""Why did she never try to get to know me? Why is she so cold? What the hell did I do to deserve this?"" are the questions I asked him pretty much every time I saw him. He never had an answer. All he could say in her defense was the he could see ""both sides"" (even though the issue started when I was a fucking kid and did absolutely nothing) and that she was so stressed because she had to clean up and sometimes no one would eat her dinner. Which is an absolute joke because when I raised my younger sisters by myself starting at age 13, they did the exact same thing to me. My 13 year old self NEVER treated them anywhere close to the way stepmom treats me.

&#x200B;

I even tried confronting the source of the problem a few times, but it never helped. It probably made things worse. She would just deny any responsibility for her actions and act like I was absolutely insane. It always devolved into shouting because I would get unimaginably frustrated that no one cared or recognized the borderline abuse. And the terrible part is there was nothing that I could really confront her about. There isn't one big thing that she's done; just 7 years of acting like I am not my father's daughter and like she was the victim of a hate crime. It is so hard to put that into words when someone asks you what exactly stepmom has done that is so irredeemable. I would much prefer that she had done something big; knowing someone hates you but will never show it in any other way than coldness is so much worse to me than anger.

&#x200B;

It got much worse when I had to move back home about 6 months ago because of my financial situation. Also note that I am not freeloading. I have a full time job, I pay my own car bill, I rarely eat their food due to stress-induced appetite loss, I buy all my own clothes, pay for everything related to my dog, and until it got bad I paid rent in the form of using my lunch break to drive my sister home from school (10ish miles from home). And I swear, when I moved in I tried so hard to make things better. I tried so fucking hard to be her friend. But she has just hid away in her room for the majority of the past 6 months, avoiding me. There were some times when it was ok, we'd have friendly conversation, but it never lasted more than a few weeks. I'd either do something unknown to upset her, or she would do something that upset me. 7 years of tension would just bubble over any time anything happened.

&#x200B;

3 months ago, I stopped trying with her. I realized no matter what, she will always hate me. There is no relationship to be had with my stepmom. Ever. And it made me so angry that my Dad didn't care how much I was hurting. He didn't care that the situation made me feel like I was back in that house with my abusive Mom, 13 years old and utterly powerless. So not only did I stop trying, I started being kind of mean. Every time she said something passive aggressive, I'd rudely call her out. Not like it mattered anyway since she rarely talked to me, but I stopped talking to her. I made sure to leave as much as my stuff in the way as much as possible. I stopped doing anything to help stepmom and Dad during my work hours (8-5 M-F, I work from home and used to use my lunch break to drive my sister home from school). I rarely ate her dinners. Stuff like that.

&#x200B;

I'm not necessarily proud of my behavior, but I'm not ashamed either. I hate being mean and it actually doesn't make me feel any better, but I also refuse to just keep ignoring how she treats me. I just wanted something to be different, you know? I didn't care if it made things worse because then maybe someone would finally help me. No one did. My Dad and I began to grow apart and now I have a hard time seeing how he can love me and still let this go on for years.

&#x200B;

And last night, he let it slip my stepmom is trying to manipulate him into kicking me out. She evidently told him she would move out--OF HER OWN FUCKING HOUSE--just to get away from me. It's the most manipulative thing she has ever done. And it absolutely broke my fucking heart to hear that 1. someone hates me that much and 2. that my own father didn't think that was unacceptable thing to say. Yes, for the past 3 months I have not been nice, but I have not been evil. I have certainly not done anything she herself hasn't done for years. There is nothing wrong with me and I have to keep reminding myself of that. I have certainly done nothing to deserve her making my Dad choose between his daughter and his wife. The conversation ended with me reminding him that under state law, he can't kick me out unless he wants to go through eviction proceedings. I never want it to come to that, I only mentioned it because I have a dog that I am responsible for and I will not let her live on the streets. And that's where we left it.

&#x200B;

The past few weeks have made me realize that he will never stand up for me. He will never admit that there is nothing that made his wife hate me other than her own crazy. He will never admit that she 100% started this situation out of jealousy or something else when I was a kid. He will never admit it's not my fault (except the escalation that happened when I moved in, something I freely admit I 100% had a big part it). He will never leave her, even though in desperation I have asked him how he could love someone that hated his daughter so much. He won't even admit that my mother abused me for 10+ years, even though the state literally took his children away from her and the investigative report done by CPS was the most scathing, one-sided report that judge had ever seen. He will never love me enough to protect me, and it's devastating.

&#x200B;

Thank you for reading this very long update. I am about 90% sure I have a place lined up to move within the next week. I will be leaving this house and never coming back unless their marriage ends. I still love my Dad but I am so disappointed in him. I'm not cutting contact out of anger, I'm cutting contact because it is too painful to have my Dad prove to me every single day that he doesn't care how bad anyone treats me.

My family is full of tech illiterate people.  Since I was in high school I've been the go to for fixing tech problems.  If there is an issue they will usually text or call me and they can drop it off for me to look at if its something I can't fix over the phone.  However now I work in IT so I am spending 8-10 hours a day fixing other people's tech issues and now I don't want to spend more time outside of working doing the same thing. 

I explain that if it is something super quick I can help with over text then I'll try, but that anything more than that and I need them to look it up themselves or go to a shop to get it fixed. Most of them were very understanding.  Some were not.  My aunt actually pretended to not see my message explaining my situation to her and she showed up at my doorstep with a box full of things she wanted fixed.  I refused to take them and explained that I don't have time to do these things for them anymore.  She called me selfish and said I don't care about family anymore before she threw the box in her car and drove off.  

The next day I started getting texts from a few other family members that wanted things fixed telling me I was selfish and that ever since I got that new job I've been acting like I'm too good for family.  This really hurt.  I've even been uninvited to a family party I was looking forward to because it is at Aunt's house and she doesn't want me there.

Is there anything I can do here?  Or do I just have to accept that some of my family sucks and move on?

Hey everyone! I wanted to thank you all once more for your help and support on the situation with my brother and his now ex-fiance. I took your advice and let him know that I support him and just want him to be happy, him and the ex fiance had a huge fight and we're getting all his belongings picked up today. 

He's doing really well and it will probably take him a long time to heal from this but he's the happiest and most relaxed I've seen him in a long time. After everything blew over I showed him my post and he left a little message for you all. 

Heyoooo (its the brother in question) gotta say the one thung my brother got wrong was the reconiciliation for the past month. With the wool removed from over my eyes i seen what she had done to me AND👏I👏GOT👏THE👏FUCK👏OUT👏 thank you all for the support and the advice yall amazing inspiring people yall amazing i love all yall peace ✌

Tldr: Brother got out of his toxic relationship!","Don’t be surprised if she tries to come back saying she’s changed and wants a second chance. Unless she’s gone through months of therapy and really worked on herself it’s a lie and things will just go back to the way they used to be. 

Stay strong. It’s awesome to see a family really support each other.",4630,34,2019-08-05 11:19:31,cm9p77

I was looking through my old posts out of boredom and realised some people asked for an update on this. Life took some turns! 

I never got around to asking him out as he went on sick leave due to stress shortly after the math exams. I didn't want to pester him when he was already going through something. I didn't, and don't, know him well enough for that to feel appropriate. Unfortunately I have no idea how he is doing now, but I hope he's okay. 

The exams went terribly for me, speaking of. I did pass, but nerves got the best of me! Luckily the rest of my grades keep me at a good average.

Anyway, it's not all bad. In the summer after my post - and after some horrible Tinder dates - I fell in love with one of my long term friends and fortunately he with me as well (to be fair I always thought he was beyond amazing)! 

So, I'm in a great relationship now, we're moving in together and I will be a fully fledged teacher come January :)

Thanks for all your replies though, they were really helpful at the time!

Tl;dr - Didn't ask him out in the end as he went on sick leave, but life moved on and I'm in a good place, hopefully he is too.",I remember your original post.  Glad everything worked out so well.  Good luck with the teaching gig!,4523,32,2019-11-14 19:57:00,dwevbt
relationships,UPDATE: My [26F] boyfriend's [25M] friends [20s Ms] keep telling him to break up with me while I'm grieving my mother's death.,"Original post:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/aqcc5k/my\_26f\_boyfriends\_25m\_friends\_20s\_ms\_keep\_telling/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/aqcc5k/my_26f_boyfriends_25m_friends_20s_ms_keep_telling/) 

My post didn't get very much attention, but I thought I'd post an update anyway because I like them so much.  I'm also hoping it might be therapeutic to write this out.

I did break up with my boyfriend, albeit not immediately after Reddit resoundingly told me to.  A lot of people were saying to me that by doing this to me (especially at this time), Andrew was expressing a lack of commitment to me and consideration for me.  I think part of me knew that as soon as it happened, but I just wasn't ready to accept it yet.

We ended up staying together after the incident I described in my post, partially because he apologized profusely and reassured me, but mostly because I had just lost my mom and I wasn't ready to lose him too.  I don't regret staying with him these past few months; he's provided me a lot of support that I would have been to afraid to ask for from anyone else in my life.  But as time went on, his lack of consideration for my feelings and our clear incompatibility continued to resurface.  We talked about breaking up a couple times, and I finally decided to pull the plug last night.  Unsurprisingly, he was pretty relieved.  He admitted that he has wanted this for awhile, but has ""wronged"" me so many times in our relationship that he felt an obligation to ""do right by me"" and not end things until I was ready.  

It's hard to take this kind of loss while I'm still dealing with the loss of my mother, but I know it's for the better.  Thanks for the advice, Reddit.

I decided to follow the advice of everyone on Reddit, my family, professor, etc. and take the job. It is an amazing opportunity in a beautiful city with a reasonable cost of living. It is a job doing exactly what I want to do with a team I really liked and on which I feel my contributions would be heavily valued.

The BF and I have amicably ended our relationship. Unfortunately, I'm going to be stuck here for the next 3.5 months because I can't afford to move out there (2500 miles away) more than a few weeks before the job starts, even though all my classes this semester are online. I can't really go out to many local social events during that time, since I know I will see my now-ex, and it would feel like a dagger twisting through my heart to see him with a new girl. I still think I'm making the best decision for my career (and likely my future happiness); the next few months are just going to suck.

TL;DR: I accepted the job offer like everyone told me to, even though it ended my 7-month relationship.","Oh thank god, I was getting a little worried there based on some of your comments in the original post. You absolutely made the right decision. ",4433,107,2019-01-29 23:02:05,al5zdu
relationships,[Update] I (28f) am tired of fixing everything for husband (32m),"[https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9wnsk7/i\_28f\_am\_tired\_of\_fixing\_everything\_for\_husband/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9wnsk7/i_28f_am_tired_of_fixing_everything_for_husband/)

It's been a few months since I posted about being exhausted by my husband's lack of ability (will?) to makeup after arguments and/or saying cruel and hurtful things. Despite a brief period of ""improvement"" he quickly went back to his habit of what I considered abusive tendencies.

I joined a support group shortly after my original post. A few weeks after that my coworker walked into our shared office and found me crying at my desk...again. I've been friends with CW for a while, careful to talk as little about my home life as possible and for some reason that day I just broke. I let out years of feelings on the poor man and he just sat and listened. Him just being a kind human made me realize how bad I had let things get. Simple kindness is strange to me. People asking how I am and actually caring is a foreign concept that I distrust. I felt (and feel) stupid and pathetic.

In the past month I felt myself very drastically distancing myself from my husband. He became suspicious, went through my phone, and read my Ejournal. He was furious when he read that I spoke to CW about my feelings, accused me of cheating, and threatened divorce. This time I just said ""fine"". So we're done. I moved into the guest room

A few of the original commenters called BS on the autism excuse he used, they were right. A few nights after I moved into the guest room he stumbled in (very drunk) and said that he had been cheating on me. I don't even care if its true. The second I agreed to the divorce I just felt relieved. I also feel guilty for being relieved but the second I agreed, I realized his s\*\*t isn't my problem anymore.

I'm made regular appointments with an abuse counselor at my college who's helping me sort through the nonsense I put myself through. I blame myself largely for enabling his behavior, maybe if I had tried harder to communicate earlier in our marriage we could have fixed it. Or if I had not been so afraid of the fighting and avoided raising issues, we could have made it. I'm not sure but it's not really relevant anymore.

TL:DR: Original commenters called it, he just didn't care enough. Husband didn't change, threatened divorce again, I said ""fine"". We're over, and I just feel relieved.

PS: Bought a lock for my bedroom door as well

&#x200B;

Small edit: I realized that I failed to mention a few things on why I'm staying in the house: We do have a daughter (9), and kids make things a little trickier. I am in an intense nursing program and only work (very) part time as a tutor. He works nights so our interactions are limited to the two days he has off. I leave before he gets home and when I'm getting home from school, he's out the door. I know it would be best to find a place to stay but the resources in this area are extremely limited. My college is literally in a cornfield.

I also want to thank you all for the support, I have felt so lonely for months and to have strangers be so kind means a lot to me. I'm definitely going to download  that book, "" Why Does He Do That?"", and make the time to read it. 

We were married for 10 years and one commenter did the easy math....Yeah I was 18 when we married, 17 when we met. I was fresh out of a physically abusive relationship, and he was so nice to me.  Again, the kindness and support means more to me than I can express, I'm determined to be a stronger person and trust myself again.",">I blame myself largely for enabling his behavior, maybe if I had tried harder to communicate earlier in our marriage we could have fixed it.

Nope. It's more likely that abusers prey on people who are like you: people pleasers who want to go with the flow, who make up excuses when people treat them badly, who have porous boundaries that are consistently violated, and who are empathetic and desperately want to believe in the best of people so they give second, third, fourth chances. 

Just like a lion on the plains can sense the weakest, slowest gazelle, so can abusive people sense potential victims. ",4397,63,2019-03-21 06:28:27,b3n6y7
relationships,My (31m) wife (34f) is ghosting our marriage,"My wife left me on April 9. She came home from work early for the first time in months, said we needed to talk then said we love each other, we care for each other and we’ve never had a lack of affection, but that she’s unhappy and she’s leaving me. She packed a bag while I was trying to talk to her and she left. 

We’ve been together for nearly 10 years. Nothing happened. We weren’t fighting, no skeletons in closets, she didn’t meet somebody else. We’ve both been digging in and trying to get through the grind lately but she did this completely out of the blue. She’s barely talked to me since. She never replies to me, only comes with prepared statements, says them (writes them) and ghosts again without actually talking to me. 

All I can think is that last October her dad died and they were extremely close and it has been really hard on her. I’ve been trying to help as much as I can, I encouraged her to go to a therapist and tried to make her feel loved and comforted at home but instead she’s been throwing herself into work nonstop for probably 6 months at this point. I’m talking 6 am until 9 pm every day.   

She’s not only pushing me out but she’s pushed anyone who asks about us away too. From what I’ve been able to gather from mutual friends she’s working even harder now, and destroying her reputation at work while she’s at it because she’s micromanaging everyone. 

Since she left I’ve been asking her to go to couples therapy with me but she won’t. She refuses to even try and save the relationship. She said it’ll just hurt like this again when it happens next time, but I can’t convince her that there doesn’t have to be a next time. That no matter what we aren’t the same people we were before she left me and that if we try and work together we can grow from this and be stronger. She can’t see any of it and I’m afraid she’s completely ignoring what she’s doing by working so much she can’t think about anything else. 

I hoped her mom could talk her down but she threw me under the bus the second she realized if she pushed back my wife would cut her out, despite the fact I took a lot of time off of work last year to help her after the funeral and after she had some surgeries. My wife’s best friend from work and another of her close friends messaged me separately and both said she’s not acting like herself but they can’t say anything to her or she’ll push them out too. It’s like everyone is just giving her room to self destruct.

I keep telling myself it’s going to be ok, she’s going to realize she doesn’t have to do this, but it’s been 20 days and I’m starting to lose hope. I don’t know what to do. I have my finances in order I know what I can and can’t do on my own, but I can’t leave because I’m not giving up on her but every day I wake up surrounded by the cold remains of “us” and it hurts so bad I can hardly breathe. 

Tl;dr my wife is having a depressive episode (I think) and left me.

Edit -
I think I might have misrepresented what I'm doing. I've cut contact. I'm not spamming her or trying to make her talk to me anymore. The first few days I tried everything I could think of, but I do respect that she needs space and I've since cut all contact unless I absolutely have to talk to her and even then it's only about logistics.

I've examined my financial situation and I've made plans on how to move forward and I plan on doing it. I'm going to the gym to help with the anxiety and stress, I'm eating healthier, and I'm trying to find a therapist for myself. I'm doing everything I can to actually move on and get through this.

The problem is just that I feel a lot of guilt about, what if she's actually in crisis and I leave. Everyone else is ready to just let her self destruct so they can pick up the pieces later and I feel like that's not what she needs. The other side is she won't let me help so I don't have a choice but to go and that hurts too.

I also know I'm being unfair to her mother and friends in this post. I have told them all during our separate conversations that I understand why they're doing what they're doing but it still hurts all the same. I do want them to be there for her if she'll let them.

Also -- I 1000% agree that this is very one sided. I'm literally just saying what I understand to be happening and I fully accept that I don't know her reasons for doing this and that's part of what makes this so hard. I thought we were good at communicating to one another but apparently I thought wrong or something changed and took that communication with it and I didn't see it.","Unfortunately you can't prevent someone from blowing up their own life if they are really determined to do so. People in depressive episodes often cut away their support network and that seems like what she is doing. It sucks, but at this point you need to worry about protecting you.

relationships,UPDATE: I left and you can do it too!!,"UPDATE: I left and I just wanted to shout it from the Mountaintops!

My first and only Reddit post  is here [I need to leave my husband](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/d1licq/i_know_i_need_to_leave_my_husband_but_im_feeling/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

And I am just so thankful for the insights I gained there. There was some blunt reality but it felt loving and it’s a big part of what made me realize I was fooling myself in thinking my husband would change or that his habits and behaviors wouldn’t negatively effect our kids.

I was encouraged to start seeing a therapist which I did. The first one I tried ended up being a beautiful fit which I regard as nothing less than a miracle. She was blunt and insightful and gave me the courage I needed to face my guilts and fears and put my kids first. 

He’s an addict. That is a lifelong battle. And because of everything else he has put me through and let me do alone, I just do not have the love necessary to want to face that battle together with him forever. 

It took me just under 3 months from feeling totally conflicted to conquering my doubts, making a plan, and getting the hell out. Making that plan was seriously my biggest obstacle. And I let it be, I think I used it as a crutch. Finally, I sat there for 2 hours and went through every possibility till it just clicked and I went “duh! That can totally work!” 5 days later I took all my stuff and the kids while he was at work. 

Here is what I want to share with those who face similar situations: my therapist let me know as kindly as she could that although I did a great job of protecting my kids, there was no way I could guarantee 100% that they would always be safe there. And if they ever got into any of those drugs or were harmed because of them, my kids would also be taken away from me for staying in a home where I knew those dangers were present, for subjecting them to it. 

That shattered my perception of control real fast. Because its true. We cannot watch every movement every minute. 

I just wanted to stand proudly and say that after 7 years of desperately clinging to any chance at happiness, equality, and a partnership, I was finally able to leave the man I have been in love with for 16 years. I truly believed with every fiber of my soul he was my one true love. 

And I almost didn’t make it through the first week away...it was much more difficult than I expected having grown to hate him so much...it still hurt...but I did make it through and already I am so much happier, so much freer, my kids are more loved (he is finally giving them attention), and I can see hope for us all. 

I made excuses for his behavior because I felt I could see the nuance of it all...But what others helped me realize is that some behavior needs no nuance to it. Some stuff is just fucked up no matter how you slice it.

So I just wanted to encourage anyone else who is in a similar situation, you might need to start talking more about your problems so that others can help you see how little control you have and how horrible it really is. Then put yourself first, don’t let them manipulate you back in, and get the hell out if you know in your heart you should.

TL;DR my husband is a lazy, selfish drug addict who I could just never quite convince myself to leave. But I finally shared my struggles with others who helped me see the real problems and accept the solution: taking the kids and GTFO. Already we are so much better off ☺️","Congrats on getting out of a toxic, unhealthy environment! How is your relationship with his family now that you've left?

relationships,(UPDATE) My [23F] boyfriend [29M] keeps making my depression about him and it only makes me feel more hopeless.,"Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9q3b3p/my_23f_boyfriend_29m_keeps_making_my_depression/

Not sure anyone would care for an update, but I figured I'd make one anyways.

After my post, things kept going as they were. He kept making my depression about him, not really listening to me or empathizing with my feelings. I just got a little too overwhelmed by him. He started to blame me for my feelings ""affecting"" him so negatively. He was upset that my depression was making *him* bummed out. I started going in to a downward spiral of depression. 

The long story short is that we broke up about a month ago. It started off as a ""break"" so I could just deal with it on my own without ""affecting"" him, but now it is permanent. 

Anyways... About two days after the break started, I immediately started noticing I wasn't feeling as depressed anymore. I know the depression will always come back in swings, but at least I don't have to deal with him digging in the way he was. He's upset that we won't be getting back together but I feel infinitely less stressed.

TL;DR: Boyfriend was digging in and making my depression about him. We split up and now I am no longer in a downward spiral. ","> About two days after the break started, I immediately started noticing I wasn't feeling as depressed anymore

Funny how that happens when you get away from someone who is toxic FOR YOU.

Stay the course, and be proud of yourself. You've got this.

relationships,"[UPDATE] I'm (27F) scared my friend (50M) is becoming isolated during a long hospital stay, but the stigma surrounding his illness (AIDS) limits what I can do","In the original post, [I described](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/bmb8j3/im_27f_scared_my_friend_50m_is_becoming_isolated/) the predicament of my dear friend, a >30-year HIV survivor who suffered massive inexplicable treatment failure and was alone all day in the hospital because his husband was at work and he'd kept his condition a secret. I also described my quixotic effort to become his one-woman T cell cheerleading squad.

I'm sorry to report that my friend has died. After all that could be done was done, he went home and passed away surrounded by his loved ones.

His suffering is over. That's supposed to be the important thing. In the original post, I avoided talking about the suffering. How his intestines had filled with abscesses and bacterial films and Kaposi sarcoma and God knows what else to the point where he vomited fecal matter. How he weighed \~80 pounds and had a bedsore that showed bone.  How the virus had invaded his brain in a way that might have condemned him to Alzheimer's-like deterioration had he lived, even with the newest and best drugs. He'd stolen three decades from HIV and that bastard was out for revenge. Call me a sweet summer millennial child if you like, but it was the worst thing I've ever seen.

Nonetheless, I'd be lying if I said I was taking his death well. I'm writing this  from inside the Pillow Fort of Grief I built in my living room. Redditors have no way of knowing, but he was a wonderful, special person. I opened my heart to him for a reason. The world is a worse place without him.

I'm grateful for the advice of some of those who commented on the original post. I did ease  up on the presents. When I visited the hospital, I focused on just spending time with him. We watched a lot of HGTV, and I would try to  make him laugh by making fun of the questionable taste and skewed priorities of the couples on House Hunters. I held his hand, brushed  his hair, stuff like that. The last time I saw him, I told him I loved him and kissed him on the forehead. He could speak faintly at that  point. He said, ""you're so good to me."" You probably have no idea what that meant; I've always thought of myself as a robot and a moral failure, and he knew it. He was the gift-giver in the end.

On social his husband is maintaining that he died of freak complications  from routine surgery. I wish I could tell him he didn't have to do this, but this very week an authority figure in town went viral for a deranged homophobic rant in which he said, among other terrible things, that AIDS was God's punishment. I feel like I'm trapped in an '80s time warp, but minus all the fun parts with the synth music and crazy fashion. 

I don't know what happens now. Clinical depression? Volunteer work? Befriending the husband? There's a big old void right in the middle of my life. It's the price you pay for caring, sometimes.

TL;DR rest in peace my beautiful friend

&#x200B;

\*\*\*EDIT\*\*\* Wow, this post exploded. I am overwhelmed by all the condolences and well wishes and unusable throwaway karma coming my way. You're all the kind heart of Reddit. And you like my writing? That's too much. Stop it. 

People are asking why I think I'm a bad person. The answer is that I was diagnosed (probably correctly) with an autism spectrum disorder in my teens and told that my social deficits were caused by failure to develop the capacity for empathy. There is now tons of pushback on this theory of autism, but it was dominant at the time. I was vulnerable and impressionable and I thought, ""Oh no, I'm a sociopath. I'll have to spend the rest of my life hiding how rotten I am inside."" I mope about my moral fiber the way other women mope about their weight. I'm doing it right now, fretting over whether this post is narcissistic. 

My friend showed me another side to myself, a bright mirror. He changed my life. Losing him is heartbreaking.","I'm so sorry for your loss. Any terminal person wants to be surrounded by friends and loved ones til the end, and you were no doubt one of the people he was happy to have. You weren't afraid to touch him and give him simple physical intimacy of held hands and a kiss to the forehead. That must have meant so, so much. 

I'm also sorry your town has a case of the Terminally Stupid Ass-Pustule in the form of that homophobe. I'm a vindictive little queer so I'd like to think that he probably won't die surrounded with love and attentiveness like your friend.",4279,118,2019-06-20 06:06:04,c2sc74
relationships,[UPDATE] I [24M] think my girlfriend [25F] is cheating on me,"To see the original story, I’ve linked it
[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/dihwh9/i_24m_think_my_girlfriend_25f_is_cheating_on_me/)

[MOVING UPDATE]: She left an hour ago and got all of her things. She brought her friend, who was also my friend too, and they were packing her stuff.  But also giggling like a couple of teenagers? All I did was sit and catch up on some emails from work, not paying attention to either of them. After about 3 hours, she had all of her things in boxes. She tried to take some things that were mine, and I told her calmly that she didn’t pay for it, so to please leave it with me. I contacted the nice couple we rent our house from and they were extremely supportive and are letting me change all of the locks, so my buddy and I are going to do that tonight. He is also helping me move my desk and electronics to the spare bedroom, since my ex used it as a closet and storage space. When she left, I finally saw some remorse, but I think she was just being nice to me because she was happy to be going to that guy’s house. She hugged me goodbye, and I let her because that’s my way of getting physical closure. Whenever she hugged me, she would run her fingers through my hair, and she did it for the last time today. As she left I felt sad, but I also felt optimistic because I can now live in peace without carrying that burden of wondering if she is cheating on me. From now on, my life is just me, my family and friends and of course my pets. Thank you all for the kind words and encouragement. If anything else happens, I’ll try to remember to update. But until then, I’ll see you all around. 

Edit #2: Wow thank you guys so much for the words of wisdom and support. To answer some frequently asked questions, since there’s too many responses to reply to individually I’ll post them here. 
1. After this, I don’t have any intentions to ever get back together with her. She made it known who and what she wants, so I am going to put all of my energy towards my job and family and friends. Even if she does come crawling back, I will not have her number and she will have no way to contact me.
2. I wasn’t her first boyfriend but I was her first serious one. We got together when we were 19. I met her while I attended college and she worked at this restaurant just outside of campus. We were each other’s first couple milestones. Such as moving in together, getting animals together, giving a good part of our lives to each other.
3. I know there is better for me out there. Thank you guys for picking me up. For now, I will only focus on furthering my career and being the man of my family since my dad passed away in July. When it’s time for me to date, I will know. In time, I will find the right one, a great one. 
4. With the suggestions of my friends and most of you, I am going to get tested Monday morning. I don’t think there was anything being passed around, but you can never be too careful. So yes, Monday morning I’m going to make sure nothing is wrong. 

Edit: I appreciate the advice about how NFP is not a form of contraceptive, I get that. It’s definitely not something to do if you don’t want children. However before this cheating and sneaking around began, we were headed towards marriage (me planning on proposing for our 6 year anniversary in January) and wanting to start a family right away. For us and the state of our relationship at the time, and specifically for my latex allergy, we were comfortable with doing that. We were committed to it and had no problems or scares during the 5 years we were doing it. It doesn’t work for everyone, so please be careful. Please, guys, the last thing I want is to be scolded that I shouldn’t have used that method. I’m just looking for some pick me ups and kind words. Let’s put all that other stuff aside. Thank you.


So update as of yesterday, I asked her how come she had grown so distant. She didn’t give me any sort of answer, so I just asked. “Is there another guy?” I got her to confess she had been seeing a guy she met on tinder. She told me that I just wasn’t the one for her. She got no satisfaction from me anymore and that I was just a weight in her life that kept her down. For the record, I haven’t stopped her from pursuing her dream career, even though we sacrificed an income for her to do so. I have always been respectful of her needs and wants. I like to think I have been a decent boyfriend to her. She asked for an immediate break up, because she was gonna move some stuff into the new guys house. I told her that was fine. But she had to get her stuff out at once. I didn’t want her to come back two and three times a week to get her things. She wants nothing to do with our pets so I am keeping the cat and giving the dog to my mom, who could use some company since my dad passed away a few months ago. It’s really hard to see how cold she was. No tears or sense of regret. So tomorrow (Saturday) she is taking all of her stuff in her dad’s pickup truck and moving to that guy’s house. I asked her how long this had been going on, and she said 2 months. It’s a little bit nauseating because we had still been sleeping together in that time. I appreciate those of you looking out for me, telling me to use condoms, thanks! But we were doing that Natural Family Planning, where she tracked her fertile days and all that, so we weren’t gonna get pregnant unless we actually tried. I’m sad because this is a woman I’ve grown to love and essentially have grown with as an individual. I just can’t believe how much she’s changed over these past couple of weeks. Hopefully she finds what she truly wants and is happy.

TLDR- my girlfriend I suspected of cheating on me confessed. We broke up and she is moving in with her new guy.","lol she’s moving in with a guy she met on tinder after being with someone for 5 years?

when she realizes the mistake she made and begs you for another chance, remember how you’re feeling right now",4257,213,2019-10-18 15:36:47,djp7r1
relationships,UPDATE: I've [M26] decided to break up with my fiancé [F26] of 8 years. Need advice on how to proceed.,"Link to original post https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/bylrpo/ive_m26_decided_to_break_up_with_my_fiancé_f26/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

I appreciate all of the advice on my last post. i didn't expect to get so much attention on it. But things went about as expected. She cried, I cried, she begged. It wasn't pretty. But for two weeks we've been broken up and she moved out today. The first few days were aweful. But afterwards we were able to talk to each other like normal people. And I helped her with everything I could. I let her take the room while I slept on the couch so she could have space and I tried to make myself as scarce as possible.

It's been a sad time and a sigh of relief. She also admitted to me that the reason she never tried to fix anything was because she didn't believe I would ever actually break up with her. She apologized and promised to work on herself. Which I appreciate. I told her there wasn't a chance we could get back together. We just aren't right. And she even said she is willing to try being friends after a while and I told her she is free to talk to me anytime but I won't bother her while she is getting over things.

I'm going to have to work things out properly with my financial status. But this is all for the best and I'm glad It happened. I only wish I could have done it earlier.

Thanks again for the advice. It helped a ton.

TL:DR I went through with the breakup and we are both doing fine now. Thank you for your help.","> She also admitted to me that the reason she never tried to fix anything was because she didn't believe I would ever actually break up with her. 

She deserves a lot of credit for not only realizing but vocalizing this.  Most people either don't realize it or are too proud to admit it.",4254,43,2019-07-01 18:52:23,c7y2iu
relationships,My [26F] sister in law [31F] always goes into my bedroom for no reason. How can I get her to stop?,"Before anyone says anything, I know how stupid this sounds. But hear me out. 

I have my own home with her brother, and all three of our bedrooms and our only bathroom is upstairs. The only reason anyone has to be upstairs is to go to the toilet, or possibly to my daughter's room if their kid is playing there too. 

I've noticed whenever my SIL comes over, she just walks on through to our room, which I kinda feel like is an invasion of privacy. All the clean laundry comes to our room, and if we have visitors we tuck away a few things in our room so it's invariably the messiest room in the house and the one we least want people in. But no matter what she's always in there, and seemingly for no reason at all. It's usually to 'see my paint colour' (it hasn't been painted in over a year) or 'see the cat' or 'look out the front window'.

The worst was today - I came home from work early as I'm feeling ill. I knew she was coming over with her kids and my partner kindly said I could stay in bed and not worry about coming down to be sociable etc, especially with the kids over it's a lot when you have a headache. He said he just wasn't gonna mention I was home at all because the kids would come try and chat and play if they knew I was here.

So I'm listening to them play in the next room and SIL comes up to check on them and sees they are all fine. THEN SHE OPENS MY BEDROOM DOOR. I've stuck my head under the covers and she hovers then closes it again. Wtf?? Why is she always opening my bedroom door like what is she expecting to see? 

I just feel like because we're all adults it's an unspoken boundary, you don't just hit up someone's bedroom without having an invite to come see or a legit reason. 

Am I weird for thinking this is irritating and not being able to make any sense out of it? Also I know that everyone is going to suggest I just talk to her about it but how awkward is that? 'Yo I know you're in you're 30s now but please stay out of my room?'. I have tried in the past to hint that I hate having folk in there because that's where all my laundry goes for ironing and all the spare toys get stored to create extra play room. She don't give a shit. 

**TL;DR: SIL always enters my bedroom unasked and this is where I hide all my messy shit when people are over. How can I ask her without sounding weird and accusatory?**","My sister was like this. She has a habit of wandering about, aimlessly looking through things. I just told her bluntly, ""Hey, could you stop looking through my stuff like that? I'm an adult now, I need some privacy."" She was actually very apologetic. She didn't realize what she was doing and has since stopped completely. There's something to be said for direct communication.",4208,244,2019-03-26 15:05:55,b5qsvw
relationships,"My boyfriend (30M) very clearly informed me (28F) that I'm not ""The One."" Should I move on?","Hi everyone! My boyfriend and I have been together for 2 years now. Last night, during a conversation about our future, he disclosed that he would never marry someone that didn't believe in God. He is Muslim and, although I grew up in an extremely religious family (i.e. cult), I am an atheist. Although I'm not sure if I want to ever get married or have children (both of my parents have married 3+ times), I do want a long term partnership. BF admitted that he would not be willing to be in a long term relationship without eventually getting married. Which obviously will not happen with me. 

I really love my boyfriend and thought we were in this for the long haul. I actually quite love his commitment to his religion as well, because I ask too many questions to have that type of faith.

Then save up a GOOD chunk of money (if you're interested in getting the tattoo changed as well, you could consider going half in on it with her to get more money together in half the time) and get a new awesome tattoo to cover the old one",4055,182,2019-02-02 18:32:12,amguq0
relationships,How do I (33/f) stop resenting my husband (33/m)?,"My husband and I have been together  15 years and married for 11. He’s a physician in the US which, as most everyone knows, comes with a hefty price tag. We got married right out of undergrad and the summer before he started medical school. I had to change which masters program i was going to last minute but i was able to get in and get a job and was able to support the both of us with this job (that I loved) while he finished med school. When he graduated, he got a residency in another state (and barely even consulted me about it before he applied and interviewed and decided. I put it behind me and packed up and moved with him and was luckily able to find another job that was better salary wise but I hated and was able to fully support us both while he was able to put all of the money he made in residency towards his student loans. After he finished, I was able to get a different job thats better than I ever could’ve dreamed of and got a major promotion near the end of 2018.

Since January 2019 my husband has been pushing for us to start trying for a baby. He also doesnt want strangers “raising” his children so he doesn’t want to put them in daycare or have a nanny when we have them. We also don’t have any family close by nor do we have any friends that would be able to take on that responsibility. He also doesn’t want to quit his job or go down to part time in his job to take care of said kids, but he expects me to be a stay at home mom. I’m not ready for a baby right now.  I’m not ready to sideline my career and leave my dream job that I have worked my ass off for.  I told him as much which resulted in a fight where he told me that I should leave my job because his is more important than mine since he “saves lives everyday” and I don’t and ultimately most people could do my job with a “little bit of common sense” whereas his is way more than just sitting at a desk all day (which I don’t even do). When the subject of kids came up years ago, he said no because he wasn’t ready and wanted to finish his education. Despite what I wanted, I accepted it and moved on because I understood where he was coming from and respected his feelings.  When I brought this up he said I was throwing it in his face and making him feel guilty for wanting to pursue his dreams. 

I had to walk away because I was so furious and hurt by what he said. And since that fight, I’ve been thinking about it over and over and have found  myself thinking things i probably shouldn’t and wanting to bring up how my unimportant career supported his ass while he accomplished his dreams but he didn’t complain about how unimportant it was then. I supported him mentally, emotionally, and physically too and if he was up at home studying I was up helping him study, I made sure his clothes were clean and that he ate and slept and was comfortable when he came home after he had a long day despite me also having a long day. I dealt with my father passing away on my own because he was unavailable due to his training. I gave up my dream program, my original dream job, the place I loved and wanted to live forever and my desire to have kids so that he could accomplish his goals. I was depressed and miserable for years at a job I didn’t like, in a city that I hated because it meant he was able get what he wanted in life. I know you’re not supposed to do things with the intention of being paid back or “keeping score” but I did all of those things because I love my husband and expected that, at the VERY LEAST, he would respect me and my career and be understanding and supportive of my wants and needs like I have been with him since the moment we got married. It just seems like I’m the only one sacrificing and being selfless in our marriage. And not only that but my job is important. I may not be an MD or “saving lives” in the moment but I am making a significant difference and change in the lives of my patients and helping improve their quality of life and leading them to be healthier overall and work alongside several physicians who have recognized the positive impact I’ve had on the lives of many people yet the one who matters most to me doesn’t recognize or believe this and it hurts like hell honestly.  I’m mad and hurt right now but I know that if the resentment fully sets in it’ll be the worst case scenario. How do I stop this from happening and how do I stop feeling this way towards my husband? 

Tl;Dr: Husband is being a jerk about my career and I feel myself starting to resent him and don’t want these feelings to get any worse towards him. How can I stop having these thoughts about him and our marriage?","I’m not sure that you *should* stop having these thoughts about him or your marriage, because you’re absolutely justified in feeling this way. He’s marginalized your career - the same career that was good enough to support him through med school - and expects you to give it up to raise your children... you know, the ones he’s too busy and important to raise himself. 

Have you considered marriage counseling? Does he know how you feel, and why you feel you’ve accommodated his dreams all this time only for yours to be brushed off like this? Does he understand that he’s basically saying that what he wants is more important than what you want is?",4060,230,2019-06-02 01:50:20,bvsdrb
relationships,UPDATE ‘My (28f) partner (28m) is convinced I am cheatinh,"Original:
https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/bh5tlh/my_28f_partner_28m_is_convinced_i_am_cheating/

So it got a bit of attention so I wanted to do an update. Plus shit hit the fan over the last few days, so buckle yourselves in.

After we spoke about the original issue, things did get better. Then, little fragments of other controlling behaviour started to come out.
I thought we could work through them.

Until when things came to a head. I found out he had, in fact, cheated on me.
When I attempted to leave him over this, he became very, very abusive to the point where he was arrested. Three things, screamed, threatened me, trapped me in the house.

I’m crushed, but relieved I found out now. Staying with friends currently. Trying to process.

So, I guess, if there’s a moral to the story - don’t ignore signs of abuse?
But, I can’t help the sense that the escalation came out of nowhere, and how - before - if you’d tried to tell me this would have happened I would have laughed in your face. I guess I don’t know what I could have done to prevent this. 
The original issue seemed to be able to be worked through, but was masking... this.

Thank you to everyone who offered advice and support in my previous post.
Apart from that one guy who thought I’d had a Freudian slip in one of my comments and became convinced I had, actually, cheated on my partner. Like I was a Scooby Doo villain. In retrospect, you can go fuck yourself.

Tl;dr boyfriend thought I was cheating, he was cheating, became abusive, got arrested, I eacaped",I'm so sorry that happened to you. Thank you for the update and reinforcing the idea that cheaters project their behavior onto innocent people,4049,64,2019-05-21 09:13:59,br84x0
relationships,"My (36M) wife (34F) gave up a high paying, high stress job for a lower paying job that she enjoys. Now she feels like she doesn’t “contribute” enough in our relationship. How can I help her get past this?","My wife (34F) and I (36M) have been together for 5 years, married for 3, and have no children.  For our first few years together, she was a full time attorney working 50-60 hours per week.  At that time, her income was approximately 40% higher than mine.  The income disparity did not bother me at all (I mean, who doesn’t like more money… hah!), but neither of us was happy about the amount of hours she had to spend at work.  When we met, she was already pretty burnt out and unhappy with the stressful job.  I tried my best to be supportive and encourage her to look for other jobs that would be less stressful.  She was open to it, but knew it would be a big pay cut.  She said she would rather stick it out for a while longer so we could pay off her student loans and save money for a new house.

Once the loans were gone and we had moved into our new home, she found a part-time (\~15 hrs/wk) job working from home doing something more in line with her interests.  Her stress level went way down, and so did her income.  She still makes very good money, but her income is about a third of her previous job.  This is absolutely not a problem financially.  My income has steadily increased and she’s still bringing in plenty.  We are doing great and have no money problems.  I have no regrets about any of it.

The thing is, every once in a while, she’ll mention that she feels sad that she doesn’t “contribute” because her income is so much lower than mine.  I tell her this is absolutely not true.  Not only does she still have great income, but she contributes in so many other ways.  Since she has a very flexible work schedule, she is able to do most of the household chores, takes care of errands during the day, does a lot of the shopping, etc.  She basically keeps our household running.  But I think in her mind, the work she does for our household does not make up for the loss in income.

She recently found out we are eligible for health insurance through one of her attorney organization memberships.  She sent me the details, but it turned out that our current plan we have through my job is still a better deal.  I texted her and said I looked into it but we should stick with what we have.  When I got home from work, I could tell she was feeling down.  She told me she had gotten excited at the possibility that we could use something through her work and that she would be providing something major.  She was crushed when I told her we shouldn’t use it.  I felt terrible…

I’m sure part of the problem is that when we met, she was independent and doing very well on her own.  I think she now feels like she has become dependent on my income, and that makes her feel bad.  Also, she went from working 60 hours/week to around 15.  So she has much more extra time to enjoy life, but I think she feels guilty about it.  I’ve told her many times that the money is not important to me, she contributes so much more than a paycheck, and I’m much happier now that we can spend more time together.  I think she understands that, but she is still hard on herself about it.  She’s not a money-grubbing person, but she has said she often thinks about all the money she has given up by quitting her high paying job and how much better off we would be financially if she stayed there.  But, luckily, she remembers how awful the work was and knows she does not want to go back to such a stressful job.

I was wondering if anyone might have some advice on how I can make her feel better about her contributions to our relationship.  She knows that I’m so much happier with our current situation, but she still has issues with it internally.  I don’t know what else to do other than to keep telling her how much better things are now, even with less income.  If anyone has experienced this (on either side), I’d love to hear how you dealt with it.

Thank you!

TLDR: My wife’s income decreased quite a bit.  While we are doing fine financially, she said she often feels sad that she doesn’t contribute as much anymore and feels that she has become dependent on me.  I’m looking for advice on how to convince her that she contributes more than her fair share.

&#x200B;

Edit: I wanted to say thank you so much for all of the replies! Also, there are a couple of questions I figured I’d try to explain here:

Why did she cut her hours down so drastically (60/wk to 15/wk)? 

While she was working at her old job, we decided we wanted to start a family. The ideal situation was for her to get a low-hour, flexible, work-from-home job so she could be a stay at home mom with a little bit of income on the side. This job popped up and it seemed almost perfect for us. Unfortunately, the baby has not come as quickly as we had hoped (which we knew was a possibility). So we are kind of in limbo where she doesn’t want to quit her current job or start a new full-time job because she could get pregnant at any time. 

Can she increase her hours from 15 to XX? 

Without going into much detail, her job essentially gives her “tasks” each week. They vary in difficulty, but usually take her about 6-7 hours each. She normally gets two a week, but occasionally they have an extra for her. Unfortunately, her employer does not have enough tasks to steadily give her 3+ each week. So she’s kind of maxed out where she’s at. They are flexible in that she can request to only get one (or even zero for a short time) task a week.","I'd also remind her that there's more to ""contributing"" to the relationship than just money. I had a job some time back where I earned a great living, but the stress levels were so high that I literally had panic attacks some days! I eventually left that situation for my own sanity, and now I'm in a place where I earn less, but I'm so much happier. 

The lower stress made it so I could be a better husband and father. That was (and is) worth so much more than money!

relationships,I [25f] asked my SO [25m] what I thought was a reasonable question. He thinks it was loaded and unfair.,"So I've been with my boyfriend for about a year and a half. He's quite stoic, not very emotional. He has a tendency of just saying or doing anything to keep the peace and hates conflict. We've sort of fallen into a pattern of me wanting things (to talk more, to do more things etc) and him doing them 'to make me happy'.

Nearly every time he does these things or I bring up that they're important to me, he says that those specific things are not important to him. Here is a list of things he's stated are not that important to him:

* Physically being in the same place. We've recently gone long-distance (not far though, about two hours away from each other) and when I mention I would like to see him more or be together more, he says that being physically together isn't a big deal for him, or not 'as important as it is to me'. He says that he 'doesn't mind' going to see me, as long as it's not inconvenient.
* Sex. Our life has dropped off since we first started dating (not significantly, about twice a week now instead of five or six, not a big deal). He's mentioned before that sex just isn't that important to him. It's fine and he likes it, but not a priority. He rarely initiates anymore.
* Physical affection of any kind. He's not a cuddler at all, he doesn't care much for kissing (he'll mostly do it because I want it, I feel, though he hasn't stated this expressly).
* Communication. Since we've been together he's stated that he doesn't feel the need for any type of meaningful communication or to talk much. He will do it to please me.
* Doing activities together. He doesn't feel the need to do anything specific together. Doesn't see the point of dinners out, doesn't see the point of social events.
* Holidays together. He hates holidays, doesn't see the point in them.

This list goes on but these are the main ones. Also, these things came out slowly during the course of the relationship. He would do the above activities, and only later tell me he did them for me. The only activity he's ever said he enjoys doing (with me) is watching a movie together at home. He also enjoys buying little gifts for people in general) and will buy me little thoughtful gifts.

Last night, he told me that he can't afford to come visit me (it is about a $50 flight) because he's decided to go to a wedding (his friend's ex-girlfriend's sister's, whom he has never met, don't ask) where he will spend way more than that. I've come to visit him twice in a row and can't travel during the period we're both free because my own sister is visiting during that time from Europe (he's close with my sister btw, and him not visiting will mean he won't see her as well). I said that two months of not seeing each other is long for me and that it sucked. I wasn't angry, but definitely upset, and I said I didn't want him to not go to the wedding (I actively encouraged him to go) but that I feel he doesn't ever put anything in our relationship on priority.

He then told me again how the same things that are important to me in the relationship aren't important to him. So I said okay, you've told me many times about the things that aren't a big deal for you/aren't a priority, and that's valid. So what IS important to you within the relationship? I said it doesn't have to be the same things as mine, but surely there is something within the relationship that is sacred or a priority for you? He said that was a loaded and unfair question and refused to say anything. He then said that some of the things I stated were important to him, just not as important as they are to me, and not something he would necessarily sacrifice other things to do. I just said goodnight and hung up after that, and now don't know what to say.

He is a kind person and I appreciate that he does things to make me happy, but I wish there was anything he did just because HE wanted. It must be tiring for him to constantly be doing things he doesn't want to do, and it's tiring for me to know it's always, always a chore for him. I don't know if it was bitchy of me to put him on the spot or if it's something valid that should be addressed. We are so different, but I enjoy being around him and I really do care for him. I'm just starting to feel that we are too different and want very different things.

tl;dr my boyfriend has a list of things he doesn't consider super important in a relationship. I asked him during a semi-argument what he DOES consider important. He thought I was being unfair and has still not answered.

edit: I really didn't expect this to blow up the way it did! Thank you to everyone who has taken the time to leave comments. I want to go through each one properly, sorry if I haven't replied to yours yet! The consensus seems to be that this isn't a relationship he's invested in and that I should cut my losses. I think this is something I've known subconsciously for a while, but to have nearly a thousand people reaffirm it makes me feel like I'm not the crazy one for once. I also think I need to visit this whole issue in therapy and explore why I feel the need to just be in a relationship, why I don't expect more for myself, and why I don't think I can do better than this.",Jeez. I don't want to sound rude but I don't know how you date him. Everything he said he feels isn't important for a relationship is incredibly important for pretty much every relationship. I also think you asking him what his list of important things is  reasonable as he certainly isnt a conventional man.,3970,138,2019-12-12 15:05:09,e9op2w
relationships,My (20F) BIL (30M) is an asshole and yesterday was the last straw,"Edit: Thank you so much for your advice and kind words! I don’t think I need any more advice for now. Will probably post an update at some point.  
I think I will be meeting my sister to discuss this and probably avoiding him as much as I can. Also, I will try to clean my shoes again, and if that doesn’t work I will tell him to buy me another pair and that I won’t be tolerating his abusive behavior anymore.

For context: My sister (27F) is now pregnant with their 2nd child. Me and sis started really getting to know each other 4 years ago. Prior to that we didn’t really have any meaningful connection because of the age gap and other family issues. Her and BIL met and have been a couple for 5-6 years now, so he’s always been around. 

He’s basically “the clown type” as I may say. He makes fun of everyone that’s not on his “superior  level” (even of my sis, calling her names when I’m around- she says she doesn’t mind). He also constantly makes fun of our father (because he’s very conservative) and jokes about him every time he gets the chance to.

I’m really busy with school, but on a good month I’d probably hang out with them (at their place mostly) once a week. Me and my sis are getting along just great, have a lot to talk about and I love her a lot. 

Ever since I met BIL he started making fun of me in a way that made me really sad, like “why are you so shy/ skinny/ sad? Nobody will ever like you. You have no friends because of x thing.” In a somewhat jokingly manner so that if I ever said he was being mean, he would say “oh, I’m only joking, don’t be so sensitive”.

For a couple months now he started making fun of my appearance- “you have Dumbo ears”, “your nose is like a skiing slope”, “you’re as fat as a cow” (I gained a little weight but nothing serious). I think I’m fairly good looking but his words really bring me down and I start questioning it. He also started pulling pranks on me- he painted my face pink when I was about to head to a party with my other sister, and because he is much heavier then me I couldn’t get away and had to redo all of my makeup.

Yesterday, I was hanging out with my other sister (18F) at their place. My BIL’s wife was at work and he came home to grab something. He enters the house and says “your belly looks like Jabba the Hutt when you laugh, you’re so fat OMG”. I didn’t say much thing back and just started packing my bag to head out. When I’m about to put on my shoes I notice he has written my dad’s name all over them in red marker. 

For the first time ever, I got really mad and yelled at him. I told him that it is too much and very mean of him. So he started rubbing my shoes with alcohol and the writing is gone, but they’re still red from the marker and look like shit. I just grab them and tell him “I never want to see you again, I hate you” and left.

When his wife found out, she texted me that she’s sorry for what he did- but I just didn’t reply. I’m so mad about it all. I still want to be around my sister (especially since she is pregnant and their other son always asks to see me +I love them so much). 

TL;DR: my BIL makes fun of me and has pulled a really bad “prank” on me. I still want to see my sister, but not him.","He sounds like an insecure twat and if she wants to put up with him and that behaviour, that’s on her, but you don’t have to take it. Hang it with her elsewhere but don’t go to the house.

relationships,Update: Am I [32F] being unreasonable with expectations of my husband’s [37M] parental and household responsibilities?,"Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/a63it9/am_i_32f_being_unreasonable_with_expectations_of/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/a63it9/am_i_32f_being_unreasonable_with_expectations_of/)

My original post didn’t get tons of attention but I figured I’d provide an update for those interested. 

**TL;DR:** I talked to my husband about how our household responsibilities are far from equally shared. He was very receptive to my input, open to change, and apologized for slacking off and being lazy. He also thanked me for communicating everything so well. 

After finally a month when the kids were laid to bed and there was more quiet and less chaos. I sat down at the table and discussed with my husband how I felt burnt out and exhausted assuming nearly all of the household chores and mental load. 

This came after I came prepared with a written sort of cluster diagram of every chore that I do and all the mental “inventory” I have to keep track of in the house (e.g. shampoo, groceries, diapers, kids clothes, toilet paper, etc) I explained that I have to keep all the balls in the air, if I don’t, then it negatively affects how easy the household is run and will negatively affect other people. For example, if I just boycott keeping track of things that run low, such as toilet paper or diapers or laundry detergent, it’s not good for anyone. A kind of “emergency” situation would arise. 

If my husband fails to do his chores, he was oblivious to how it implicitly places the burden on me to pickup the slack. His time spent on leisure activities and not his household responsibilities shifts more chores on to me, while diminishing *my* free time that I could have. The household is like a business and everyone has to chip in and do their part. 

After explaining all this, my husband was very open and apologetic of the fact he was so unaware of how his behavior and lack of action was negatively affecting me. He confessed his “radar” for seeing things on the floor or that need to be put away just wasn’t there and he really needs to keep working on making that better. 

He also apologized for prioritizing his fun hobby projects over completing his chores first and then, consequently, leaving no time for his chores due to the interruptions of our kids. He also apologized for his lazy behavior and said he’s really going to make a better system for himself to get his household tasks routinely done that doesn’t require me asking. 

In the end, he said he really appreciated me bringing this up in the way that I did and reaffirmed that everything I do “Does not go unnoticed” and that he is so thankful for all that I do. 

It feels good to talk things through calmly as adults and come to a healthy solution that comes with concrete action. Here’s looking towards a less-stressful future ahead :) 
","I'm glad you and your husband were able to discuss the situation calmly and he responded positively to what you have to say! I am curious however, did y'all actually come up with a plan to divide the household labor? I believe you when you say your husband *intends* to do more work around the home, but as they say, ""The road to hell is paved with good intentions."" 

A plan such as a chore chart, timeline for doing chores (e.g. mop the floor every Wednesday, load the dishwasher every evening) takes away a lot of the need to develop ""radar"". Responsibilities are clearly and explicitly laid out which sets everyone up to succeed.",3910,41,2019-01-12 20:05:26,afb24y
relationships,Update from original post of my bf (24M) not wanting me (22F) to take antidepressants.,"Here is a [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/89h4nt/my_22f_boyfriend_24m_is_very_against_me_taking/) to the original post.

&#x200B;

It's been a year, ""Eli"" and I are both a year older now than before, imagine that.

&#x200B;

I began taking my antidepressants a few months after the original post was made. I went through more therapy to be absolutely certain that I needed the medication. My therapist used the same multiple choice test on my feelings and symptoms twice (pre-test and post-test) to determine that nothing had changed/gotten better really over the course of 3 months or so. I began taking 10mg a day of an antidepressant and sensed a change fairly quickly. It took 3-4 weeks to fully kick in, but I think I started feeling it around 2 weeks. I am so much happier than before and I do not think about my life ending 3-5 times a week anymore. Now that I write that, I rarely think about it at all now. The things that used to seem like mountains are now just little mole hills. I cannot fully express how I wish I would have considered taking medication earlier. I feel like I wasted years of my life being so disgustingly unhappy.

&#x200B;

Just earlier this week I broke up with Eli because I will be moving away for a job and I was no longer happy with the way the relationship was going. I still care about him immensely, and because I care about him so much I knew it was best to cut things off if I could not see the relationship progressing further after 3 years of dating.

&#x200B;

I'm super excited to start a new chapter in my life!

&#x200B;

**TLDR: Took meds, broke up with boyfriend. Feeling insanely better! :) Thanks so much to all who originally commented and gave me advice! Or tough love!**

relationships,A girl [20F] from my [20F] bf's [20M] class sent him pictures last night.,"Hi all. 

I'm a law student, and met my boyfriend Tom through mutual friends around the start of our first year. We've been together for eight months now and its the happiest I've ever been. Tom is a medical student, and we're both the first people in our families to make it to higher education. 

In Tom's class there is a girl called Isabel. Tom told me she's top of the year and word is going around that she's a ''future world changer'' or something like that. They weren't close friends but she used to help him study sometimes, he says shes so smart that ''anyone would be an idiot to turn down her help''. 

Anyway I didn't meet her until me and Tom were grabbing some food and she came into the same place with her girl friends. The first thing I noticed about her was that she was absolutely gorgeous. Literally a solid 10. They started chatting and she asked who I was. Tom said (and thinking about this makes me smile) with a huge smile that I was his girlfriend, and Isabel's response was to say ''Thought you had better taste than that?''. I was a bit hurt and Tom was confused, but neither of us thought much of it. 

Anyway, we didn't deal with her again until a month or so later when Tom's flatmates left the place to him so he invited me over. We were watching a movie when Tom got a call from Isabel, who was crying, saying she'd been kicked out of a club for being stoned and it was nearby his place, asking if she could stay the night until the morning. Tom wanted to say no but I didn't want to just leave her out there. 

When she got in she was absolutely drunk and high as possible. Giggling and laughing and reeking of weed. Her clothes were ruined from where she'd spilt her drink over them. I helped clean her up. I always bring a change of clothes when I stay away, but I gave them to her to make her more comfortable. Instead of saying thank you she tried to say how ''cheap'' my clothes were and how she wouldn't be seen dead dressed like that. I tried to tell her not to speak to me like that but she just made fun of my accent and how I speak. I put it down to the alcohol/drugs and didn't hold it against her. 

Ever since then Tom started to distance himself from her. He still accepted her help with work but nothing else beyond that, and even that came to an end after she told him she'd only keep helping him if he went out with her. The final straw came not long after we came back for second year. Myself and Tom went out clubbing. Isabel and her friends were there. Tom got extremely drunk and was being sick in the toilets. He could barely stand up and was confused. One of Isabels friends came up to us and announced to him that she'd seen me kissing another guy while he was being sick. Tom got hugely emotional and wanted me to confirm/deny it. It took a lot for me to calm him down and convince him it was a lie, by which point Isabel had already ran over to ''comfort'' him. He realised it was her that made up the lie and shouted at her to leave us alone, and she started crying and went to the security accusing us of acting aggressively towards her, at which point we were both kicked out. 

Ever since then she has left us alone. We spent Christmas with our families but were together for New Years. After watching the fireworks, we were snuggling in bed when Tom got an insta DM from Isabel. She sent him a few pictures of her with dyed hair and the words ''New Year, New Me.'' Let's just say those pics reveal much more than just her new hair colour. Tom was fuming. He swore at her and blocked her on everything. 

That's good, but when we go back to uni she's still going to be around. Her and her friends frequent most of the places we go to, and she's still in his class. What's going to stop her from bothering him again? He's said he wants nothing to do with her, but she obviously doesn't feel the same way. 

TL;DR: A girl from my boyfriends class acted unpleasantly to me and then tried to break us up, before sending him pictures last night.","That chick is toxic and obsessive. Your boyfriend took the right steps here and has been behaving just the way I would expect a good man to. So bravo to him for how he's handling this.

No more kindness or ""benefit of the doubt"" should be given to this woman. Assume all behavior from her is going to be rude and manipulative. If you or Tom are out somewhere and run into her, if you do not HAVE to be at that location, then LEAVE. Make sure your mutual friends in his program know the history you posted here, and that they make sure you guys are not invited to the same events she is. I don't know a lot about medical school, but if there are group projects or schoolwork that Tom and Isabel are assigned to do together then make sure professors know about her behavior and ask to be reassigned. 

If she continues this behavior, make sure you have as much documentation of these incidents as possible. Take it to school administrators as evidence of sexual harassment. Make sure the university steps in if the behavior escalates. 

Other than that, keep ignoring and block/delete anywhere you haven't already. Eventually she will either get a clue, move on to someone else, or escalate to the point where university administrators have the authority to get involved. Good luck! She sounds like an absolute psycho.",3881,169,2019-01-01 16:12:11,abjake
relationships,"My (27F) friend (27F) of over 12 years wouldn't accept finals as my reason to not attend her out of state Bachelorette party. I agreed to make it work, but now there's absolutely no plan even though its in 4 days and I'm starting to feel bitter.","\*\*EDIT: Wow, I had no idea that this would get as much traction as it has. I wish I could go and thank each of you for your thoughtful comments, but time isn't really something I have a ton of right now ;) And for those of you who said you relate, might I encourage reading ""Boundaries"" by Cloud & Townsend. Obviously this is still a huge struggle for me, but I'm thankful for the example others who have figured it out can set for us ""people pleasers"".

One of my best friends of over 12 years is getting married in October and chose a college friend to be her maid of honor. There was just one weekend thrown out to have both a bridal shower and bachelorette party, in a city 600 miles away from me. Unfortunately, it is the weekend that my finals and group projects are due for graduate school and it's the first week of school for me, as I work as a behavior therapist in a school. Once I discovered this, I immediately drafted an email explaining the situation, including several other weekends that my husband and I could come up to celebrate, and apologizing profusely. I get an email back about how everyone's ""busy"", but she thought I would be the one to understand since I just got married (about a year ago) and how she went to all my festivities. Against the wishes of my husband and therapist, who I'm working with to say no during this busy time in my life, I agreed to make it work, and have made arrangements to take finals early and have working with my group to try to finish our work before we leave.

The party is this coming up weekend, 4 days away. I have not been told a schedule, don't know where we're staying, how much anything will cost, etc. The MOH has been flaky with email, didn't tell me which airport to fly into (since the initial thought was bridal shower in one city and bach party in another, but who knows what the plan is now) so now I'm driving 8 hours on Friday to get there. Since the MOH hasn't been answering me, I had to text the bride asking for a plan and she said she knows nothing either, but asked if I could potentially drive people back from Bach location to bridal shower location, which would add 2 hours to my already 8 hour drive. I have no idea when I'll have wifi to look over my group project and already have to change my work schedule during the first week to accommodate this party, of which, there is literally no plan.

Originally, my plan was to just suck it up and not add drama to the situation by chalking the rude email up to wedding stress and just not saying anything; however, now I'm at the point where I'm feeling such bitterness toward my friend and basically want her to know how much I'm sacrificing to be there for her and this terribly planned weekend. Do I talk to her about it? What do I even say?

TL;DR Friend guilted me into attending bridal shower/bach party in a city 600 miles away from me even though I told her I had finals and it was my first week of school, as I work in a school. The party is 4 days away and there is no plan and now I'm starting to feel bitter and don't know whether to say anything or if I should, what to say.","I wouldn't go if I were you. 

Tell the bride that MOH didn't organised enough in time nor given you enough information to allow you to find a workaround with your job, which is true right? And that *real* celebration is the wedding. If you are invited and attending, you can make sure you made a HUGE fuss of the bride on the day (if she even notices)

If she shows lack of understanding still then I'm afraid that shows the level of friendship you have with the bride. A true friend, close or not, would understand or at least tell you so and grin and bear it no matter how upset she may be.",3743,245,2019-07-29 11:40:37,cja3l8
relationships,[Update]Friend [37/F] is about to be turned-down for a promotion she has dreamed of for years. I [36/F] know it's coming and don't know how to support her or what to do.,"[Previous Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/b47frm/friend_37f_is_about_to_be_turneddown_for_a/)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Lordy. Where do I begin. I need more help. 

&#x200B;

The guy they wanted took the job - way more than they initially wanted to spend. My friend was devastated. I followed the advice here and told her she did a great job and how proud I was of her, but the other guy did an amazing job and I didn't know what would happen. She was confident that she was going to win - she had more experience with the company vs. his experience & education. At 4:55 she got a call thanking her but that they went in a different direction. HR offered to meet to discuss how she could improve and to stabilize working relations with the new guy. Shortly there after it was announced company-wide he had agreed to take the job and they were thrilled. She took the following couple of days off and didn't respond to text or email. She just completely took some time away (fair enough). She returned mid-next week and found-out that he wasn't going to start until a couple of weeks later and that she had time. Then a company-wide email went out announcing that not only had he finished the final requirements for his MBA and took first place in his final case competition beating every other school in the country but that he was starting sooner than anticipated. A lot of emphasis was placed on his Ivy League education, which really irked Tina. 

&#x200B;

He would come in occasionally (before his start date) to meet with senior executives and his team members and pushed them to get unvarnished thoughts - a lot of them really complained about working conditions on the team and major obstacles they faced. A few really told him the unvarnished truth. 

&#x200B;

His start date rolled around there after, and the hype was real. He hit the ground running and his first week was incredibly busy. On day one he held an open meeting where he came in and immediately banned weekend emails (some teams were expected to check/respond to emails 7 days a week), gave staff commensurate working hours to the rest of the company (we never got summer hours or flex time, which he immediately changed) and followed-up on promises made by previous staff. He rolled out new processes, budget models and is a far more effective at advocate for the team - so much so that all the old time staff have become his ""followers"". A lot of people were worried about being fired (performance had been way down) but we're already seeing a glimmer of hope - the cuts he made preserved his staff, meaning they have a little less cash to spend but a lot more bodies doing the work. All told, they're better off now ( three weeks in) than we were this time last year. The staff love him, he's very approachable, informal and because of his connections to senior leaders in other departments, that team gets a lot more attention than we used to. Our old boss was sweet and kind, but she was incredibly ineffective. I'm considering transferring back into that unit because the working environment is better than where we are. 

&#x200B;

The problem has become Tina. She's tried to question his leadership, she's openly annoyed with colleagues and feels like she's the only person who doesn't ""see"" the truth. The value in the new guy is his ability to change - our teams work in close collaboration and their team is a lot more productive now than before and are getting better quality work done - they've started conversations with old clients and the business funnel has grown. VPs openly comment that he'll be moved up in short order. Yet, Tina holds are horrible grudge. It's obvious with how she interacts with staff and colleagues; she complains when he's not in the office and complains when he is in the office. I know of a least a few people who are growing weary of this and two have asked me to say something to Tina (since we're friends). Another threatened to go to HR. 

&#x200B;

For all his connections and Ivy League education, the guy is also a really strong performer. He has an activity board up showing process and change and people feel less dour, except Tina. She's complaining non-stop. It's impacted our relationship to the point where I've been avoiding her. It's been two months since she found out and three weeks since he started, and I feel like ""enough is enough"" that said, she's a single mom and I don't want to see her fired for being silly. 

&#x200B;

I'm really not good with confronting people, I don't know what I should say. 

&#x200B;

tl;dr the new guy started and the hype was real. he's been great but Tina took rejection so badly that I'm worried she's going to be fired. I'm not sure how to handle this. She's going to get fired if she doesn't stop complaining and people want me to speak with her.","Tina’s only hurting herself in the long run. When this guy moves up in the organization, Tina’s the next logical candidate for his current role - as long as she quits acting so unprofessionally. I’m not saying she has to become the guy’s biggest fan; just quit moaning and whining.

The way Tina behaves now is what upper management will think of when they’re looking at her for other roles. If she can show that she can be professional with someone she doesn’t like, she’s laying the groundwork to show she can be a good team leader in the future.",3718,118,2019-05-27 16:33:39,bto2oo
relationships,[UPDATE] Girl [20s?F] who my [23F] ex [23M] cheated on me with reached out to me. Not sure how to respond.,"**TL;DR: The girl my ex cheated on me with randomly messaged me a couple months back, turns out she was pregnant! Kind of got closure, am very happy.**

Link to original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9mb89u/girl_20sf_who_my_23f_ex_23m_cheated_on_me_with/

Hi all, my initial post didn't garner much attention, but I wanted to give a short update.

I never responded back to Jessica and basically told her that while I understood she was guilty there really isn't anything she can and should do for me. Just that she has to make better decisions now and hopefully her guilt would mean she wouldn't hurt another person like that again. 

During the Holidays, my ex's dad greeted me a Merry Christmas. I was also told of the news that Jessica was 4-5 months pregnant with my ex's child. :O It lines up now, and I guess that's why she messaged me, because they found out around that time. Just wish she was really sorry lmao. 

After that my ex and I had the chance to talk. While of course I was still not ok with the fact that he cheated on me, I wouldn't wish ill on an unborn child. He has a lot of growing up to do, and is not the most financially stable person. It also turns out the girl is quite young. I told him that I wished him well despite everything. His dad told me that he still believes he can make something of himself. 

When my ex and I talked, he admitted to me that the reason he cheated was because he knew I was already going to break up with him. This is partly true because months before, I sat him down and talked to him about issues in our relationship, and I had wanted to bring his attention to the fact that things really were no longer healthy. I guess it was my prelude to an amicable break-up. He told me that there really was a better way to break things off, but that he was too scared to be alone after breaking up. So he made sure he had someone to run to when we finally broke things off. I just really wish we could have ended things better, he was my best friend. 

The news shocked me, but in a way I guess I was able to get closure. I'm currently in a good and healthy relationship and starting the year with a really great outlook.  

Thank you all for the advice! I wish everyone had a great holiday!

**EDIT:** Oh wow, I really wasn't expecting this to blow up! I thought my post was locked but glad I checked. I was sick last night and only had the chance to see it now!

Just a few clarifications because a lot of people have questions. I'm sorry I wasn't too clear on the details, as I didn't want to submit such a lengthy post. I realized after re-reading my post how confusing I was! My apologies :)

First is that yes, I did respond back to Jessica (the message I detailed in this post) ~~before~~ after (sorry I made a mistake!) the reddit post, but she responded again. I no longer messaged back after, hope that's clear.

You are all correct, based on the timeline she did get pregnant after we broke up/I discovered his cheating. What I didn't mention or was fully clear with yet is, around 4 or 5 months ago, my ex talked to me and told me that she and Jessica broke up, because they realized that they were in a relationship for the wrong reason. We talked for closure, but I realize now he was also testing the waters with me. I could be wrong tho! 

There are a number of people who also question why I kept in contact with people in my ex's life, or why I even talked to him after everything. I agree that it isn't the most healthy or mature, and I call myself out on that a lot of times. It was just really hard to detach from his family, who I grew close to. When my ex's dad last talked to me, he told me that things will never change and he still loves me like a daughter. :') And while a lot of people don't agree with my last communication with my ex, I think it was helpful for both of us in the process of moving forward. I think we left the conversation clearing out that we don't have hate for each other, just wishing each other well. 

Also, I have to admit that I don't have the most positive image of Jessica, and I watch myself a lot of times not to be hateful. It's hard to judge when you only have the negative things shown to you. She did a lot of hurtful things to me (outside the cheating), but in the grand scheme of things, I really don't know the full story anyway. With how the chips fell, I think all I can do now is wish them the best. 

2018 was a tough year. Went through a break-up, was cheated on, lost my sister, had to re-contact my ex to get things my sister used to own back (these are the things I referenced to in my initial post), and basically had to pull myself back up after all the pain and losses. 

But I am glad to leave it all behind in 2018, and I am starting 2019 strong!

Thank you for all the positivity and warm wishes everyone! To a healthy year of growth ahead! :) ",2019 is going to be your year!,3700,46,2019-01-07 08:45:11,adftvf

**a. Him saying ""I have a job"" involves a specific tone and inflection which is where the rudeness comes from.**

**b. This is not his first job, nor his first job working these hours by any means. Nothing about this job is new beyond a different industry/company and the payraise.**

**c. He goes out almost every night. To the bar. With or without friends. I am typically invited. I see him about once a week because of me needing time alone to do work / study, not him. I do not live with him.**

**d. Him saying ""I have a job"" in this manner to our friends - not just me - is what made me see this as less of a ""he doesn't respect my job/work"" and more like a ""he doesn't realize how he comes off"" situation.**   

**e. Yes, he is a functioning alcoholic. That is another conversation**.

I'll try to add more as I realize what I've missed and respond to people. Thanks again.



Relationship: off/on for about 2 years.

I’ve been working from home for a while (freelance) so that I can take classes I need as prereqs for a graduate program. It’s been taking like... years (3?) but I’ve also been working. I finally took on freelancing/working from home so i could take certain classes that typically conflicted w normal work hours. It’s great. It also has created a less predictable sleep/work day. 

Recently my bf also got a new job which pays better and also requires more hours out of him. He used to wake at like... 10am-11 and leave work around 5 with a flexible schedule. Now he gets up at 6/7 to get to work at 8am.

This is a bit of background to explain my interpretation of bf’s behavior. 

My bf started saying “I have a job” as a response to things, questions, comments. Things like “You should stay over at my place” or “Are you going to bed?” or especially “Are you going to the bar tonight?” even, which he does every single night and drinks with whoever there. I used to think this kind of response was just directed at me due to my working from home and working to start a new career. And yes, I find it insulting.

Just last night we were at a friend’s house gathering, sitting around the fire drinking, and he kept saying he wanted to leave (yet filled a cup full of wine for the Uber ride home), so we started to get up to go. A friend made a comment like “awww you’re leaving! I wish you’d stay!” Or something similar. 

His immediate response: “I have a job!” ... almost like an incredulous response. 

This friend had a brief moment of confusion and said, smiling, said I have a job too!”. My bf just kept going, saying “I have to be there at 8!” And she again responded “I have to be at my job at 8am too!” and having this look on her face like... thinking this was funny in a way? Like she’s in grad school and working and hearing him say this to her. Like, man you’re talking to a bunch of 30 year olds not some fresh college grads. 

I tried to tell him that it doesn’t make sense for him to keep saying that to people... like who here doesn’t have a job? That it sounds condescending and it doesn’t make sense.

He just gets offended and pissed and shuts down. I don’t know how else to explain it to him. Help?

**tl;dr bf keeps saying “i have a job” as a response to  people’s comments which is weird and condescending, and he gets offended when I try to tell him this. Don’t know how to proceed**",[deleted],3652,151,2019-11-01 16:34:27,dq6oky
relationships,My f(27) and my fiance's m(27) friends have tried to convince him to leave me due to my disability,"Hi everyone,

I'm finding all this very overwhelming so I will keep it short.

They have been our shared friendship group since we got together 8 years ago. I've had a disability for about three years. 

I recently found out three members have tried to convince my fiance to leave me on multiple occasions, purely due to my disability. They basically said they don't see the point of staying with a disabled person and they want him to be happy. He assured them each time he is happy and it is his choice to stay with me. 

They are all acting as though it is normal that they would try to convince him to leave, and that I'm overreacting by being upset. They've also stated they wanted ""what was best for both of us"" which I think was pretty obviously not true.

I'm just trying to get some clarity here because I'm feeling very confused and worthless. I have myself given my fiance the option of leaving many times and said i wouldn't blame him, but he always said he wanted to stay.

Is their behaviour normal? Is it OK for me to be upset?

Thanks in advance

Tl;dr : group members have tried to convince my partner to leave me due to my disability. Is that normal, and is it OK for me to feel upset.

Edit: a lot of people seem to be interested in precisely what the disability is. As explained below it is rare enough that given the friends in question are redditors I think it would possibly stop the post being fully anonymous. To answer in depth questions: it is a physical disability, no it is not at all weight related, I am following all the medical guidelines possible regarding healing though not everything is known about this condition. Yes I am trying my best, no I am never abusive towards him, yes I am able to emotionally support him when he needs it. Yes he has to help me physically sometimes for example pushing my wheelchair and making the majority of meals. No it is not expected to get worse over time although nobody can know for sure. Yes he has to emotionally support me too when anxiety or grief about this condition get to me. Hopefully that now gives everyone enough information to go off.

Edit 2: thank you for all the lovely validating replies. It is nice to know not everyone thinks about disability in the way they do.

Edit 3: I was not expecting the scale of this response! I have spoken with my fiance and we have both agreed to get a lot of space from these people. Thank you all so much!","If both you and your fiance are happy with each other, the rest of your friends can go fuck off. You guys are already engaged, and no one gets engaged on a whim. Your fiance's got engaged to you because he values you. 

Don't let someone else make you miserable. Don't let them dictate upon you or your fiance's happiness.

Again congrats on your engagement.

As for your friends, why are you still friends?",3621,214,2019-05-03 11:43:42,bk7hn9
relationships,An update on a post from 7months ago about my partner's (f27) depression and its impact on my (M27) life.,"7 months ago I posted about my girlfriend, her struggles with depression and how it was impacting my life and my personal needs. I got some really helpful and empathetic replies which I was really thankful for. Post can be found here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/aajrls/my_depressed_partner_27f_and_the_effect_it_has

I wanted to write abit of an update, partly for those who helped but also to show that it can sometimes get better. 

A couple of months back my partner was due to get her contraceptive coil removed. She struggled with irregular periods whilst on the coil so she decided that she didn't want a replacement and wanted to get back to a normal cycle. 

Honestly, her mood changed almost immediately. It was so quick. As soon as it was out, she started feeling better. Her want to do fun stuff has returned, and the sex drive is slowly increasing. We have already had wayyyy more sex in 2019 than we did in the whole of last year. 

She is now off meds, and even though we are going through stressful times (moving house man... NEVER AGAIN!!!!), Her moods recover to a norm far quicker.

We do more family stuff now. I'm typing this from a camping holiday together, and my stepdaughter is doing well at home and at school, bringing home a brilliant report for the end of the school year.

I don't want this post to come across as bragging. I just wanted to point out that it seemed that the cause of my partner's illness was a hormonal imbalance that was exacerbated by her contraceptive coil? I'm unsure of the science behind that but we are certainly doing better. 

Thank you to all those who helped our situation before. 

TL;DR My partner struggled with depression until her contraceptive coil was removed. Our lives have improved alot since. Thank you to all those who helped and commented!",This is amazing! I think it’s shocking the effect birth control can have on women’s bodies. So happy she is doing much better now,3568,101,2019-08-09 20:48:47,co8b4l
relationships,"I [25F] said something really stupid to my GF [24F] by accident, now she doesn't believe I didn't mean it","EDIT: Ok you guys I didn't expect nearly this much attention over my dumb brain lmao. You were probably right that I take this too seriously. I did get her flowers and told her again how I really meant it and she said it's fine and it just sounded weird in the moment. 

Also it's kind of annoying how many people missed that we are two women and start talking about how I said this because I'm a man or make other gendered theories, sorry but you're wrong. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

Anyway it's all fine and I probably didn't need to make this post but oh well now I have silver so that's nice.

Ok so I'm a dumbass. She's actually my first relationship and the first person I had sex with ever, and we are like ridiculously sexually compatible. We've been dating for 5 months now but we knew each other for 2 years as friends before that, and had already developed feelings for each other for a long while. So it definitely feels quite serious already.

Basically we were having sex, actually just got finished, and I just wanted to express how good it was, yknow? So I said 'babe, you're so good you're gonna ruin everybody else for me'. Basically unintentionally saying I'll definitely have sex with other people after her. big oof

Like 1 millisecond after saying it my brain went 'wait.. hold on a sec.. that doesn't sound right' and she was already looking at me weirdly... she said 'wow way to ruin the moment' and then kinda tried to laugh it off and I apologized a thousand times and explained I didn't mean it that way. She tried to just laugh along and play it off like she isn't bothered but she's not a very good actress and I know she's hurt. How do I make up for saying dumb stuff I didn't actually mean that way?

\_\_\_

\*\*tl,dr:\*\* I said something stupid to my GF after sex and it ruined the moment and hurt her. How can I make things better and make her believe me?","I think:
You're being to hard on the situation. Yeah you kicked up some dust with a bad phrase. But rehashing would just make it worse. 

You've apologised already and that's the best first step. Follow it up with a romantic gesture in your style, flowers, paper crafts, a gift... What ever it may be, but something simple. Finally move on. Be a good partner and continue with integrity.

Certainly a foot in mouth moment but demonstration of commitment will prevail.

I never ended up calling the cops. I mean, what would have been the point? But my sister called me again the other day. I know our mom's whole plan had made my sister see our mom in a different light (she and my other siblings were always treated better than I was).

My mom was supposed to visit in January.

Then it was March.

Now it's October. 

Apparently my mother, after years of alcohol and chain smoking, its starting to catch up to her. According to my sister, my mom's been using a mobility scooter and an oxygen tank for the past couple of months and cites that as the reason why our mom is having difficulty ""visiting"" me. My sister isn't sure that our mom would even be able to travel in October anyways. 

I want to feel bad but I don't. 

TL;DR: Psycho mom was going to fly across the country to ""surprise"" (i.e. harass) me but apparently can't due to recent health problems.","dodged a bullet there!

Several months after I made this post, I made the final decision to apply to postdoc positions all across the US.  I received many great offers and decided to move several states away to work with a well known PI in my field whom my advisors greatly respect.  After enduring a couple months of long distance and uncertainty, we learned today that my (now) fiance got his dream job in the city I moved to.  Not only does he get to remain a government employee, but his salary is also significantly higher than what he was making before.

&#x200B;

Thank you so much for all your encouragement and replies.  It gave me the push I really needed to take that dive to move cross country for a new job.  In the end, it really paid off and we finally get to move on with the rest of our lives together.

relationships,I (33f) keep getting steamrolled by visitors to my house.,"Tl;dr Visitors to my home keep ignoring my specific instructions to not do things, is this just how older people visiting are, or how can I be more assertive?

My boyfriend (36M) and I (33F) bought an older house four years ago near a town where we moved. We're from 2 different countries, and we're living in another one. When we have visitors, they have to stay a while because it takes a while and a bit of money to get here. 

I'm running into a recurring problem when we have older visitors coming, from both our families.

The house we bought is not perfect and needs some work, but it’s perfectly liveable. We know we have some large expensive chuncks of renovation that will need to be done (new roof, better isolation) and we've been saving up for these. There are other problems that are small or more cosmetic that would cost some money to fix, but we chose to set these aside while saving up for the rest.

My issue is that when older visitors come (and it's only older people), they decide to go off and fix my house even when I ask them not to.

Example 1: Boyfriend's parents come over for a visit. There was some ivy growing on a wall outside that would need a trim within a couple month. However, our ladder is broken, and my boyfriend knows he can get a ladder from his work in a couple weeks. My father in law decides he's going to trim the ivy, and I explain to him that we don't have a safe ladder to do so, and I'll get to it in a couple weeks. I leave him alone a few minutes to take a shower, and come back outside to find him having built a completely unsafe table to stand on to reach the top of the ivy (like, even less safe than he broken ladder) and trim it. I asked him five times to come down because I could see the structure wobbling and I was terrified he'd fall and get hurt. He ignored me, and when he eventually came down smiled and said ""see, nothing happened"". I was furious. I told him I was angry at him, and even that didn't get through to him.

Example 2: My dad visits with my aunt and uncle. One of the small issues with the house is that the water pressure isn't great. I know the cause, and I know it will take a plumber to have it fixed - we need to replace some pipes that are placed in a way that we need a professional. It's actually not a big bother - just don't do the dishes at the same time someone takes a shower and no one even notices the problem. my dad and uncle decide that they want to fix it anyway. I tells them not to - and explain why I know it will take a professional. Same as with my FIL - I go do something else and before I know it, they've cut the main water to fix the pipes. I go tell them to stop and they don't. Short of me physically pushing them away, I try everything to stop them, no luck. Exactly as I had planned, though, the problem can only be fixed by a professional, and long story short, they mess things enough that we have to cut the water to the whole house until a plumber can be called. It's Sunday night, so I only got someone coming around the next morning. I had to dip into the structural changes savings fund to pay the plumber, and the long term issue with the pressure is still there - we still have to replace the pipes some day. Again, I was furious at my dad and uncle, and they didn't even apologize.

Example 3: my mom is over this week. She was making food in a very nice iron pan we have that we have been seasoning for over a year. This means the bottom of the pan is blackened. If this was a teflon pan, it would be a sign it's unusable, but for an iron pan, it means it's just right. I told that to my mom multiple times, but would not believe me and tried to scrub off the seasoning behind my back, causing small specks to go in the food. Again, these are not dangerous, but we do need to redo the seasoning on the pan now. She nearly destroyed the pan and would not believe me until I made her read the manufacturer's website. 

I am a very conflict-avoiding person. It's already taking a lot of going against my nature to stand up to all these people and say ""no, don't do that"", but I do it every time. I'm sure there's an element of sexism here (this only happens when my boyfriend isn't home). I want to figure out how to make myself more assertive, and for all these people to just listen to me in my own home. I'm tried of getting steamrolled, and I am coming to dread those visits.

Tl;dr Visitors to my home keep ignoring my specific instructions to not do things, is this just how older people visiting are, or how can I be more assertive?",Your dad and uncle need to be footing the plumbing bill.,3484,170,2019-07-28 10:55:20,ciuine
relationships,[Update] I'm (32m) trying to set boundaries with (34F) unhealthy jealous spouse and she refuses to budge,"Forgot to put the update in the title initially.
[Previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/dma9rh/im_32m_trying_to_set_boundaries_with_34f/)

Wife was extremely jealous one night and said I had wandering eyes when I can barely see without my glasses that she broke. Ended up sending me to the ER and she was arrested. She is concerned about what I need to do to correct her predicament when she was the one that threw the blows.

Today was one of the pretrial court hearings. She was upset all night last night, saying it was my fault that she was in this situation of a felony for assaulting me and that her stress was all of my fault. She scoffed at the deal that the state was offering saying it was a death sentence for her career and our marriage. It was my understanding that a NC order would be in place while classes are being completed but would be lifted after. She was under the impression that it would last through her probation.

The night prior she was upset that I was doing research on marriage counseling, saying I was thinking we were to far gone even when we talked about finding a counselor a few days before. Late nights/early morning she gets more paranoid as her medication wears off(effexor) and I try to bear her verbal assaults trying to calm her down. Having a feeling a split was imminent I packed my clothes and belongings from the place she was staying at during her NC order period while she was finishing up at court. When she got out we had another argument about what she said I needed to do to fix her situation, saying I need to spend more money on two apartments so she isn't stuck with her friend.

To put her jealousy into perspective, she was uncomfortable with me having the default female google assistant that she demanded I change it to a male voice. Also she says I have wandering eyes, accusing me of checking out any woman that is anywhere and constantly questioning me if I am cheating on her. She has no respect for the privacy of my phone and searches through it, deleting so past evidence of her jealousy (breaking my glasses) and refuses me to search through her own phone trying to point out the onesidedness of her actions.

When I called her out on her jealousy of the default google voice she demanded that I leave, that I had no respect for her friends house and that I had no place to argue there. After I decided to put out feelers for a divorce attorney and have started organizing my notes/evidence of her financial, physical, and emotional abuse over the course of our marriage.

I have a therapist I have been seeing about some of this going on and have another appointment tomorrow.

It's depressing that someone that I love would say/do things to hurt me just because of a paranoia or unhealthy jealousy. I've tried getting her the mental health help that she needs but she refuses to take the steps and initiative after getting her the information. My mom recommended me going no contact after my talking with her today and after she mentioned that my wife called her the other day, ranting about me and my faults as a husband.

I have no friends locally and I feel like with the internet that the anonymity and the disconnect with personal relationship provides a cathartic relief for my situation.

TLDR: Called abusive wife out on unhealthy jealousy and she told me to leave and I left.

edit:  Thank you everyone for your support.  It means a lot to me since I generally feel unnoticed or cared about by anyone.","> she told me to leave.

Bruh.   Take her advice and go.

You're in an emotionally and physically abusive relationship.  There's no coming back from this shit.   As long as you're with her you'll never be happy.",3480,212,2019-10-29 14:31:01,doqmn9
relationships,[UPDATE] My (26F) father (55M) contacted me out of the blue yesterday after 13 years. He wants to reconnect. Is it worth even trying?,"Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/brh5h8/my_26f_father_55m_contacted_me_out_of_the_blue/

Hi all,

Thought I would update you on what happened since my last post. And I want to thank everyone again for all the advice, it really helped me make a decision.

So, I decided to email him back, to try and find out why he was coming back now, after all these years, out of nowhere. And oh boy, am I glad for not having jumped all in...

Instead of telling you guys what happened, I think simply translating the emails (with all names redacted of course) will make it much easier to follow. So here we go.

Here's the email I sent him, in response to his first messages to try and reconnect. Not a very nice email, I know, but I wanted to see if he had really changed and if he was actually ready to apologize or at least recognize what he'd done wrong.

- - - - 

Hi,

Email not easy to read (nor write). Just trying to be honest here.

I don’t have an answer to give you yet, I’m thinking about it, I can’t get past 13 years and tell myself “let’s forget everything and start from scratch” in 2 days. I need to think, given the situation.

But I do have a question for you – why now ? Your answer won’t influence my decision, I just need to understand. My first reaction when reading your emails was ""is he dying ?"". Try to understand, 13 years with no contact and I receive this on a Monday morning, out of the blue, it brings up a lot of questions in my head.

And it’s not like nothing’s happened in these 13 years. Maybe it would be easier if that were the case (or maybe not, I don’t know).

The last I heard anything about you, via other people, was 2 years ago when gran was ill. 2 years. That’s not long ago, and I’m still recovering from that period. The last 2 years may have been the most difficult years of my life. 2 years of depression, thinking about gran every single day, being mad at you for not contacting me, hating you for not even telling me when the funerals were gonna take place, and because of all this, I won’t ever be able to get closure. And yes I also have some blame in there, don’t think I haven’t been mad at myself during the last 2 years as well. I will be mad at myself, and at you, probably my whole life, this story is not something I will ever be able to just forget.

Trying to reconnect at that time, 2 years ago, might have seemed more logical to me. When a family goes through this kind of thing, with a family member very sick, they have to get closer to each other, around that family member. At least, that’s what I thought. But instead, I had people telling me you got angry at them for just letting me know gran was sick. Like I didn’t have the right to know about it ? At that time, it seemed very clear to me that I wasn’t part of your family at all, and that you wanted me to stay as far away as possible. I felt your hatred, which I never managed to understand.

Whatever happened between you and me, I’d always hoped, until then, that if whatever happened for gran, I would receive a quick email, or a message on FB, anything, just to let me know what was going on. But no. So I’ve had to try and grieve gran without being able to say goodbye, and I’ve had to accept the fact that my dad wanted nothing to do with me. It’s far from easy, hence 2 years of depression.

All the arguments around money, the stories between you and mom, or even the stories between us and [new wife], all of that is very old for me. So old that today, I can’t remember everything that has happened. So it could be easy to forget about these, if there was all there is to it. But what happened with gran is something I am still feeling today and is much harder to get past.

So yes, my question is, why now and not 2 years ago ? I will wait for your answer.

I know reading this email can’t be easy, as I said before, it was far from easy to write as well. But if you truly want to reconnect, on my end I need to understand before I make any kind of decision. 

- - -

He then replied, and his email made me the angriest I had ever been before. Since my following reply includes his whole email (I replied inline), I'll just paste my reply and you'll have his email at the same time. Here goes.

- - -

HIM: Ok, let’s be honest and speak freely : let’s talk about gran, poor her, my she rest in peace. I think your relationship with her was more than occasional and that at one point, she got tired only of only being contacted for your birthday,

ME: >> So already here, no. Just, no. My relationship with gran was very good at the time. I was at Uni and I would go spend the weekend at her place very often. We would play Yams, I would make pizzas, etc. I have lots of good memories of that period. So, no.

HIM: that’s why the last years of her life she had cut contact with you (yeaah, still a money argument !).

ME: >> And no again. I remember perfectly the last conversation I’d had with her. I was calling her to tell her I just passed my License Degree. And she was mad after you told her that we had apparently “stolen your money”. And she just hung up. So no, I am not to blame here. You’ve taken enough from me, I won’t let you tarnish my memories of her.
And what you probably don’t know, is that she asked for my forgiveness, when I went to see her 2 years ago. She knew perfectly what happened, and knew I wasn’t to blame in the story. So, just, no. When I went to see her at Uni, I would always try to avoid talking about my relationship with her, to try not to make her sadder that she already was. While on your side, you decided to bury me and break my relationship with her. So if someone is to blame here, that’s you, certainly not me. MY fault, was to accept it without saying anything, and not trying to reconnect after a while. And yes, I blame myself for that. But for everything else, you’re gonna have to wake up at some point and accept the consequenses of your actions.

HIM: By the way, quickly on the side, not having any contact with me, ok, but why did you cut ties with [new kids], they didn’t have anything to do with the situation, [new wife] has always felt really affected about this.

ME: >> I wasn't against them. But you lived together. If they’d tried to contact me, I wouldn’t have said no, far from it. But here again, you’re putting all the blame on me, that’s quite easy.

HIM: Getting back to gran, indeed, I didn’t warn you when she got sick, nor when she died, because, and I’ll be perfect honest here, I imagined you coming out of nowhere, without warning anyone, without having taken any news from her for years, and I imagined you coming to do the inventory.

ME: >> Funny, that’s EXACTLY what I told [gran’s best friend] at the time. It’s crazy how you’re turning the situation around to your advantage. Let’s be clear, right now. I DON’T GIVE A CRAP about your money. And when I heard about gran, no, I wasn’t the devil you created in your head, I just wanted to see her, for me, and for her. NO SHITS GIVEN about the f***ing inventory. If that was what I cared about, no need to go see her, I could have just found you or taken a lawyer. 

HIM: It’s because you cut ties with gran that I didn’t want you there and that I didn’t try to reconnect back then. We were very shocked at the time, with gran’s best friend, about the way you acted. So no, it was absolutely not a question for me to try and reconnect with you then.

ME: >> The way I acted. Nobody thought that maybe, just maybe, I needed a moment to process what was going on? Years with no news, and the whole situation gets thrown at me out of nowhere, with no warning. When I received the FB message, 2 days later I was on a plane to go see her. Afterwards yes, I took too long to call her again when I got back home. And yes, I blame myself for it. But here again, it’s very easy to paint me as a devil, without having even tried to understand what was going on in my head.

HIM: To answer your question, « why now », well I’m asking myself the same. It’s been weeks, months that I’m thinking about it and I’m trying to let my heart speak instead of my brain.

ME: >> Your heart ? Seriously ? I don’t see anything in this email that shows me you even have one.

HIM: And at the same time, if I didn’t do this, would you have done it ? I’ve gone through my past, persuaded myself that I needed to stop banging on about my resentment towards you which also had consequences on your sister who didn’t do anything.

ME: >> Here congratulations, this is the best I’ve heard all year. So you’re basically trying the blame the fact that YOU cut ties with her, on me. I must be dreaming. Nobody ever prevented you from taking her on weekends or during holidays, when I decided to stop coming. By the way, legally, you HAD to continue seeing her. But no, you’re right, that must be on me again !

HIM: It’s not only during « grand happenings » that you’re supposed to get news from your family or try to reconnect. By the way, I am to blame regarding your sister, for not continuing to reply to her messages since 2008. 

ME: >> Oh, wow, you’re actually accepting part of the blame. It’s gonna snow.

So, to recap your email :

· You have absolutely not changed one bit. You stay the manipulator you were 10 years ago.

· You are a First Class mythomaniac. You’ve invented a diabolical version of me, your daughter, and truly believe your own lies.

· Obviously, you’re pushing all the blame onto me (why not, after all, I am a devil who wants to take all of your money).

· And, of course, you’re not apologising for anything.

So my answer is an absolute no. I officially do not want anything to do with you anymore. If at your age, you still don’t realise that the life you invented for yourself is a huge mass of lies, sad for you, but on my end I will continue living, knowing you once and for all out of my life. I managed the last 10 years, I will live even better now that this whole thing is finally over. So, maybe, thank you! Thanks for proving to me that I was right about you, and that I shouldn’t spend even 1 more second thinking about you. My goal with yesterday’s email was to see if you had changed, I have my answer.

Don’t even try to reply to this email. I am blocking you, and if that doesn’t work, I will simply delete every single of your messages when they come in, without reading them. I won’t give you the chance to explain yourself, you just did, everything is clear as day on my end now.

I’m going to bring back a sentence you sent me years ago, when I had tried to reconnect. You said “if for you, I don’t have a wife, then I don’t have daughters anymore.”. Well today, I am telling you : if you don’t have a daughter, then I don’t have a father anymore.

Do not EVER try to contact me again. I hope that is clear. Not tomorrow, not a year from now, not even on your deathbed. For me, you died today.

- - -

And there we go! Yes, I know, I've been downright nasty. But honestly, I think I needed to get it all out. After reading his email, I felt like I was going to burst out in flames, he reaaaaally pissed me off.

And I feel so much better now. It's like, maybe I needed to push all my anger out, to feel 'free' in a way. I don't know how to explain it, but I feel so much lighter now, I haven't felt like this for years.

Feel free to comment of course and let me know your thoughts on the email exchange. And again, thank you all so much for the support. I wouldn't have managed to do this without you guys.

TL;DR: I replied to his email, telling him how I felt about the whole thing and especially about my gran. I wanted to see if he'd changed. He very much did not.",I'm sorry he brought up these old wounds and tried to make it your fault.,3457,117,2019-05-24 21:47:25,bsmrxg
relationships,UPDATE - My (30f) sister (33f) periodically fires verbal abuse at me and blaming her psychiatric disorder (BPD). I can't bring myself to forgive and forget.,"Link to original post - https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/as8ijf/my_30f_sister_33f_periodically_fires_verbal_abuse/

I'd like to say a massive thank you to everyone who took the time to respond to my post! I was over the moon with how many people replied. The advice I received was very insightful and useful. I used bits of everyone's answers to compose a letter to my sister before speaking to her on the phone. The letter consisted of sentiments of love and understanding, but also emphasised how her behavior has to stop, and that she needs to seek DBT therapy. I also set very specific boundaries in place and asked her to agree to them. I gave her a heads up via Whatsapp that the email had been sent to to ask her to read it and think on it before we spoke.

Her reaction was very positive -

""I just want to say thank you, thank you from the bottom of my heart, for writing this letter. I am so incredibly grateful and so moved, that you would do this for me after all I have said to you and on top of that having to deal with being sleep deprived and having baby issues. I honestly I am in tears right now because I truly thought that I would have to try and rebuild our relationship on my own and honestly I haven't got the tools or knowledge to know how to do that and I've been so stressed not really knowing what to do or say but knowing that I need to resolve things. I also knew that we needed to set some rules and understandings to help you cope with the situation should it happen again and so I know the consequences if things get too bad and this will hopefully help me to get myself out of it. We'll talk more about this on the phone but this is so good for me. Sorry I haven't covered everything in your email but I don't have much time, just on my lunch break. But I wanted to thank you for taking the time to research and then write down your thoughts, it does mean a lot because you mean so much to me and I don't know what I would do if we didn't keep in contact, not saying that to hold you emotionally hostage or anything, I would be ok, just know that you mean alot and it's incredibly important to me that I stay on good terms with the family. We can discuss the therapy thing when we talk. Hope you have a good day xxxx""

I'm so happy that she didn't misinterpret anything from my letter and that it went down so well. Good people of Reddit, you may very well have saved my friendship with my sister! I'm very grateful! Let's hope what she says is more than just words and are turned into actions. Have a lovely day, everyone!

TLDR - After receiving Reddit advice, I wrote a letter to my sister. She was very happy and has agreed to improve.","I love a happy ending like this! It might not be smooth sailing as your sister does have strong emotions, but this is such a heart warming response. Yay for sisterhood!",3428,48,2019-02-22 10:51:50,atg5kc
relationships,"My [17M] rich girlfriend’s [19F] family invited me to go on a vacation with them, but I don’t think I fit in.","I’m not trying to be rude at all or anything, I just don’t want to be a burden or anything. My girlfriend [19F] and I [17M] have been dating for a year now, and things are super great. She comes from a very wealhty family, while I come from a really poor family (not as poor anymore). She lives in a 2 million dollar home, her family drives new cars, and she is just wealthy, but she is not a person who feels in entitled because of her family’s wealth.

I’m also Latino and her family is American/White (sorry if that’s rude I don’t mean it in a rude manner). I do get along with her dad and her mom very well and they helped me with getting in a good university since my family couldn’t really help since I am the first to finish high school. I am respectful towards them and all and since I work in construction and landscaping, I do some work around their house. 

Her mom and dad invited me over for dinner and they told me they wanted me to come along with them and my girlfriend on a resort vacation lasting a week. It sounds nice and they said they had paid for me to go with them, but I feel real bad about it. Like, I wouldn’t be able to afford to go, but I saved a few hundred dollars from the past weeks of work. I do have some money to buy stuff over there, but I just feel bad and kind of emberassed that they are the ones paying for me to go. What should I do? Not go? Go with them? Apologize ? Or what?

TL;DR My girlfriend’s rich family is pyingn for me to go on a vacation with them, but I feel like a burden about it.","If they didn't want you there I can assure you they wouldn't have invited you, or let you work around their house. You have obviously impressed them enough to trust you and you should definitely go on the trip and enjoy yourself. Make sure you go out of your way to say thank you for the invite to both of her parents. A card and flowers probably wouldn't hurt for her mother as well.

relationships,"My family expects me (30F) to leave my family (and small child) indefinitely and move across county to care for my mother (66F), and I don’t know how to react. No expectations fall to my drug-addicted (36M) brother.","My mother is disabled due to a neurological illness. She was diagnosed in her late thirties and I remember her mostly as being sick and needing help. I used to really look up to her as super-mom who could overcome any obstacle. That was until my father died. My father passed over a decade ago while I was still in high school. My brother (36M) and I lived with my parents at the time.  I got a job while in high school after he passed, cleaned the house, mowed the grass, bought food with money from my job, paid bills when I could (minimum wage isn’t much), and made dinner most nights for my mom and me. My brother was rarely in the home unless to sleep or because he wanted money. 

Over the years, my brother has been in and out of prison dozens and dozens of times for everything from drunk driving to drug possession to stealing from our mother to assault. He is currently incarcerated. No one mentions him or expects anything of him, except my mother who, in violation of a court order for her own protection that she herself asked for, sends him money and speaks to him weekly as well as sends letters. 

Back to my father’s death (a seven month bout with illness). 

Nearly two years after my father passed. I graduated high school and left for college out of state. I would send my mom money while in college and I distinctly remember, for instance, using my stipend I received in December to buy my mother and brother Christmas gifts because I knew they wouldn’t have anything if I didn’t. No one reciprocated, but I didn’t expect it. Honestly, I didn’t care either until it became a pattern over the next decade. That particular Christmas, barely 18 years old, and I was scraping together pennies to buy a cheap fridge after I came home on winter break with gifts only to realize there was no food in the house.  My brother, in a drug-fueled rage, tore down the Christmas tree I had bought and decorated and threatened to kill himself unless I gave him money because “no one loved him” and it would prove that I “cared.” It is important to note even at this time my mother continued to let my now-felon brother back into home. 

I’ll try to skip through the college and graduate studies years but suffice it to say I met my now-husband and I spent less and less time at home. When I was home or when my husband and I visited, it was as follows: clean my mom’s home, buy my mom food, cook for my mom, take care of my mom. I was and remain very clear with my mother that I will not let my brother into my life as he has threatened to kill me (over prescription cough syrup!), thrown me down my stairs, and broken down a door to get at me (and the little bit of cash I had on me at the time). I have no doubt he would try to hurt my child, my husband, or me to get what he wants. He has told me he will find me and he “get me” for his perception that I have wronged him (for not giving him money), and I have ZERO contact with him. I have blocked all numbers that have any correlation to him including friends he has call from outside prison. Note: My mother let him get my number off her phone. 

I have told me mother for years that I cannot have my brother in my life until he at least goes one year drug-free. To date, he’s been unable to do so. He has stolen tens of thousands of dollars from her. She always says she won’t let him back in her house, but she in the end forgives him and the cycle repeats. Next year, when he’s released again, she has told me under no uncertain terms that he won’t live with her but she admits she remains in contact, sends him money, and thinks this is “the Devil” in him that makes him a drug-addict. He will move back in. 

I have offered to help my mom move closer to me as I live many states away. My husband and I even had a realtor come out and start the process of listing our home so we could find a home with space for my mom. My only condition was that she not bring my brother into my son’s life. She has adamantly refused same. She has also refused to look at assisted living facilities, even though I reached out on my own accord and found great recommendations from her doctors.

Now that she had surgery this week, I have had family come out of the woodwork. Honestly, I am resentful of this. I’ve had people who can’t even send me a reciprocal Christmas card tell me that I am “neglecting” my mother by refusing to take time off work and travel to her to take care of her. They do not care that I don’t have the vacation days and would likely lose my job. One even stated that “I wouldn’t care about putting groceries on my table. I wouldn’t work for an employer like that.” Easy words to say; tell that to my hungry toddler. They have said, “Who do you think cared for you as a baby?” and, honestly this one gets to me, “Sometimes you have to learn to deal with life. You can’t just ignore it.”—because “dealing with life” includes losing my job, moving away from my toddler in his formative years, and caring for my mother, I guess? 

You can probably tell at this point that I am fed up. I am in a no win position where literally the ONLY surviving family members are telling me to leave my job, my family, my small child, to come care for my mom and help her. They also refuse to put a timeframe on this; it would be “as long as she needed.” I am expected to care for her 24/7, no questions asked. I also strongly feel like they are taking their own resentment at my mother asking them for favors out on me, though I have explained multiple times that I offered for her to stay with us and have the surgery here (at no cost to her, mind you) and she declined. They tell me in response she has a “right to be near her friends.” I have also tried to explain that by bending down to her every beck and call, they are enabling her, but they don’t want to hear it. They do not seem to hear me when I try to explain that, for example, helping her check out of physical therapy facility a week and a half before her doctor’s recommendation, is enabling her and in the long run, not good for her independence. She has grown accustomed to everyone doing everything for her (example, on this past visit, she got very upset with me for not taking her to Wal-Mart because she had to go there at nearly the toddler’s bedtime. This wasn’t an emergency. She wanted to “look around.”). 

My mother in all of this mess has taken the position that although she doesn’t “want me to lose my job,” a good daughter should care for her mother. I honestly have a lot of animosity toward this proclamation because my mother has not, since before my father died, called me on my birthday; tried to establish any relationship with my son (I am always the one trying to get them to FaceTime or speak on the phone); and in the last twelve years, I can count on one hand the number of times she has called me just to check in on me or my son or ask how we are doing. If she does reach or and contact, there is always an ulterior motive (money for my brother or for her because she’s given my brother everything). 

I am at my breaking point. 

I can’t work full-time, care for my family, and also be expected to hear multiple times a week how I am a shitty person for refusing to abandon everything I have worked so hard for to care for my mother. Despite everything, I love my mom. My husband and his family have all seen this unfold and multiple people have remarked “Why do you even try anymore?” (meaning try to schedule calls to allow her to talk to / see my son). I invited her to my home earlier this month, scheduled the plane tickets, assistance though airport, etc., only to watch her play on her phone or spend time playing fetch with her dog rather than read a book to my toddler, who just wanted her attention. 

Today, as if a final straw was needed, I called to check in on her and she proclaimed she was going home against doctor’s orders because her dog NEEDS her because the dog is sick. First of all, he has a very minor skin condition that is nearly 100% resolved thanks to her friend  giving him the prescribed ointment. Secondly, my toddler got sick this week (meaning out of daycare for three days sick), and even after I told her of same, she never once called to check on him, just like she never called to check on him when he got the Flu last year, or when he had a mysterious week-and-a-half long illness earlier this year that resulted in four doctor’s appointments and a 104 degree temperature.

I can’t stand it anymore. I am literally writing this as a last resort. My husband is saying to go no contact with everyone (this is ALL the family I have left, except one aunt on my father’s side) because he sees me crying when the hurtful comments role in and the guilt trips. He sees me trying to hide it from my child. But then I feel like I am giving them what they want, right? Look at LittleMissPotatoe, such a crappy human being and so inept at “dealing with life,” she just chose to ignore all of us. But I can’t spend my days defending myself to extended family members I have seen in over a decade or, in some cases, over two decades. 

Nothing I say is good enough. And nothing I say ever
will be. 

TL;DR: I have been told in no uncertain terms that I am a horrible person for refusing to abandon my husband and small child and move across county for care for my mother.

EDIT: Thank you for your comments and those who offered support. There were a few recurring questions. 

(1) I am not covered under the FMLA. My employer is not large enough and my state offers no comparable law. I have one vacation day left due my son getting sick earlier this year (my husband gets nearly triple the days off than me and has taken off many, many more days to care for him). All-in-all, I don’t want to lose my job or find another one. It’s a good job, just one confined by the limits of being a small company.

(2) She has refused: moving in with me by either my husband and I building a mother-in-suite or moving to bigger home; any assisted care facilities or nursing homes; moving closer. She has flip-flopped on whether she will allow home care but contradicts herself on this point, telling me “insert name” can help her if she needs anything or she has “friends” she can call or, most common, that she “does fine” and can care for herself. She wants assistance but only *when* she wants it and only on her own terms. 

(3) She told me she will not cut ties with my brother. I’ was able to get her to agree to counseling after my brother assaulted her, stole her car, and pawned *all* of her appliances. She moved into a domestic violence shelter, yet she refused to press charges. This occurred when I was going on seven months pregnant and when I refused to travel 20+ hours in a car, I was told essentially the same thing I am being accused of now. 

(4) She excuses my brother’s behavior. He has “got in with the Devil” and she “can’t abandon him.” I have spoken with counselors, Adult Protective Services, and it boils down to, she’s an adult, she can make her own decisions. Her doctors, although they seem to agree she could use help taking care of herself, have refused to state she lacks the capacity to care for herself.","This is the point in your life that you learn to live with a few assholes thinking you're a bad person.

relationships,Update: I [27f] dumped my boyfriend [27m] for using cocaine. Now his friends hate me.,"[I posted a few weeks back about breaking up with my boyfriend many months ago for drug use](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/bv8ike/i_27f_dumped_my_boyfriend_27m_for_using_cocaine/), but wanting to hopefully start seeing him again as he started seeking a more sober and healthy lifestyle. One struggle was his friends pretty actively painting me as controlling, and someone who doesn't love him for who he is. I was also very worried about the ease of getting away from that lifestyle.

&#x200B;

I've been amazed at the continued push-back from his friends. They had a ""guys weekend"" last weekend where they'd purchased quite a lot of cocaine, plus other misc drugs (adderall, vyvanse, LSD...) He originally had been tasked with the buy for the weekend, but ultimately opted not to go. I was going camping with my friends and told him he was welcome to come along. I told him I trusted him to go, but he chose not to go with his friends. Of course, this led to his friends calling me being controlling, and that I am changing him to meet my own interests. One of his close friends in particular has been a huge instigator in creating as much conflict as possible around this... namely attacking me on twitter, and having him removed from their friend group chats for picking a girl over friends.

&#x200B;

It's really hard for me to understand all of it and why a select few of his friends have so much opposition to this. I guess I don't see drugs as a personality trait so much as a lifestyle choice, but in their minds, i'm alone in that. I fear this sounding judgmental, but the friends with the firmest oppositions are two dudes who are 29, deliver pizzas, and spend 99% of their time high, at raves and other events like that. 

&#x200B;

We've been back seeing eachother for 6 weeks now; he's been essentially sober with the exception of a beer here or there. He's been joining me at yoga, we've been doing stuff outdoors like rollerblading, riding bikes, cooking out together, etc and he said he feels a lot more level. I can tell he's bummed feeling ostracized from his friends, but i've repeatedly told him I trust him and will support whatever decisions he makes, even if it means us not being together - just that I expect honesty.

&#x200B;

It's taken me a few weeks to let go of caring what his friends think about me, but I know my intentions are good. Still sucks feeling hated, but I'm not really sure what else I can do.

&#x200B;

I really appreciated the advice and sort of reality-slap that those people are largely toxic. There was a lot of really good wisdom that helped me come to the realization that it's not worth my energy to care what they have to say. 

&#x200B;

Tl;Dr - updating: I'm not regretting seeing my bf who i dumped for cocaine use after he decided to stop using. His friends hate me, but I don't really care.","It sounds to me like his friends are the ones feeling judged. That kind of hard-partying drug lifestyle really isn't cute when you're in your late 20s and not a rockstar, and they probably realize that. It's easier to paint you as controlling and judgmental than it is to admit your boyfriend is taking the grown-up path and they're not.

Is he standing up for you? If he's still associating with these people at all he needs to make it very clear that these are his choices and talking poorly about you is unacceptable.",3350,148,2019-06-17 18:52:12,c1rg8l
relationships,"My (25M) girlfriend (27F) opened up about her past while drunk, not sure if I should talk about it or ignore it","A little background: I've been dating this foreign girl for a little over 2 months and we've had an absolutely wonderful time so far. Quite early on she already opened up that she has quite severe anxiety, but had medication and counseling to control it. Since coming here it's been really stressful for her with finding a job, a place to live, all the paperwork etc, but on top of that some of her medication is not freely available here, which she has run out of now. Once she has her medical insurance all set up, she'll be able to get other medication and go to a counselor.

This week she had a couple of drinks and got drunk. She called me after and we talked about some normal things, but after a little while she began opening up a bit more about her past. She said there have been periods where she's been depressed and at times had suicidal thoughts. I didn't really know what to say, so I said that I'm real glad she didn't because otherwise I wouldn't have met this wonderful woman. She talked about missing her friends etc and I tried to comfort her a little bit.

I'm not sure how to handle this situation. She apologised for saying those things over the phone, which makes me think to just forget about it. But on the other side, I really want her to know that I care a lot about her, that I want to be there for her, that she can talk with me about these things and that it won't scare me away. Let her know that I'm in it for the long haul.

TL;DR: girlfriend opened up about past depression and I need advice how to deal with it.","Imo: You should let her know that you are thankful that she talked to you about her problems. It must have always been in the back of her mind. Tell her that she is a strong person and that you'll always be there if she needs someone to talk.

relationships,"UPDATE: I (32F) got broken up with tonight by someone (29M) I thought I was gonna go the distance with, and I guess I just needed to tell someone.","[Link to original](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/e0smwt/i_32f_got_broken_up_with_tonight_by_someone_29m_i/)

Yesterday, I noticed the key to his house that he had given me early on in our relationship, so of course I was very sad thinking of how close we had been and how much he had seemingly wanted me to be part of his life. Then, I noticed something special of his that his mom had given to me, that I didn't feel comfortable just throwing away. I broke no contact to ask if he wanted it back, and let him know that his key was in the mail.

He responded and said I could get rid of it. Knowing that he was looking at his phone, I ventured even further across the no contact line to let him know that this was so hard for me, since he had played an equal part in how close we were, and driven the relationship just as much as I had. Then he put up an emotional wall and ditched me without a real reason.

His response?

""I'm sorry for shutting you out. I used you for companionship until I didn't need it any more. I don't have any more answers for you.""

It's a strange hurt. It gave me what I need to never look back and fully know that I would never ever go back to someone who is so emotionally out of touch with themselves. Someone who could do that to someone. But it also is making me question people. We were good partners, and took care of each other. We never bickered and enjoyed our time together, and he just pulled the rug out from under me and revealed an incredibly selfish person. Who was I even dating?

As much as I want to tell him how selfish he is, I think he knows. When I responded, I told him ""You broke my heart in the process, and this is going to be a hard wound to heal. I do appreciate the honesty."" And I think I will leave it at that, because I will never regret taking the high road. I shared so much with this person, and suddenly that person doesn't exist. At least I can intentionally move forward now.

Tl;dr: Ex boyfriend who dumped me after seemingly wonderful relationship told me that he used me for companionship until he didn't feel like he needed it any more.

Update 1: I want to be clear that I wasn’t looking for any specific answer, or to rekindle things. I was looking for ANY reason that would make this easier to process and move on. Thanks so much for all the comments so far. ❤️

Update 2: I in no way feel that I was manipulated. The original post was written 30 minutes after being dumped; the 2nd after 2 weeks of reflection. He is a good guy, and a decent human being. His parents have a really fucked up marriage and that has to affect his view. Either way, he clearly told me with his actions that he didn't want to be with me. My brain was stuck on his words. We talked about futures. He called me legs after ONE DATE because he felt like it was ""going somewhere"". He told me how excited he was about me, and how he had never connected so efforltessly with another person before. I don't think it was all my delusions. There was fault and hurt on both sides; nobody is a bad guy here. Everyone needs to sit down.","""I used you for companionship until I didn't need it anymore"" such a harsh thing to say. Just be grateful that things didn't get too much further before finding out how apathetic he is",3334,156,2019-12-09 13:18:58,e89ukg
relationships,UPDATE: My (22f) Aunt (50f) might be getting baited by a guy she 'met' on instagram and I don't know how to talk to her about it.," 

Original post here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/anrfe8/my\_22f\_aunt\_50f\_might\_be\_getting\_baited\_by\_a\_guy/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/anrfe8/my_22f_aunt_50f_might_be_getting_baited_by_a_guy/)

So, a couple people asked for an update. Hope I'm formatting it right.

After making the original post, I couldn't get the situation off my mind - it was driving me nuts and really just stressing me out. I talked it over with my mom, and asked my aunt to send me some pics of 'Andy'. She asked why, and I told her that I wanted to compare them to the painting of him she'd started.

So I acquired the pictures, then did a reverse image search as many of you suggested. Thank goodness she sent me more than one picture of the guy, because only the last one got a hit, but from there, it was smooth sailing. Turns out the REAL guy is a poplar instagram model. He's got info about him being a Marine, and having a dog with the same name as Andy's dog right in his bio. This dude was so lazy he just lifted the real man's basic info.

The DOG even has an instagram, and I found more photos Andy sent to her. And to make my life even easier, the real guy has a series of videos up in his Highlights section labeled 'SCAMMERS'. I watched them and basically it was him addressing what to do if someone is being catfished with his pics. I was super nervous, but confident I had what I needed.

So from there, I slept on it, and then asked my aunt if I could come visit. My mom helped me stay calm beforehand, and the worst part leading up to it was standing in their house saying hello and just waiting to drop the bomb.

I started off with saying 'there's actually a reason i'm here. I have something to tell you, and you won't like it.'

I explained my motives for getting Andy's pics, the reverse image search, and finding the real guy. I pulled up his profile, and the dog's, and let her scroll through it while answering questions she and my grandma had. She tried to call Andy, text him, and just...it was weird guys. She used the phrase ""I'll go psycho on his ass"" in several variants. She never struck me as that type of person, but she was just blowing him up, and of course, when she FINALLY got ahold of him, and asked him to explain what I'd found. ugh, his voice. She had him on speakerphone.

""Baby, what you saying?"" (this was basically his answer to everything she said.)

""Baby, we don't need this. You just gotta trust.""

I wanted to grab the phone and tell him to cut his crap, but didn't. I stayed a couple more hours, answering questions, trying to console her. Apparently they'd actually been talking for like...two years? I'm torn on whether or not to believe that, bc as much as I love my aunt, i know from experience she can bend the truth to fit delusions sometimes. Anyways.

My grandma, who was there the whole time, was being her usual brusque self, so I pulled her aside and tried to explain that this wasn't the time for tough love, but for the band-aid-and-kisses type of motherly support. She agreed, and thanked me, saying that she's been seeing my aunt 'change', but she didn't say how. After we went back into the main room, she was trying to be a little more sensitive, but it doesn't come naturally to her.

From there, I needed to go to work and take care of something before the work day ended.

Since then, unfortunately, it seems that despite my warnings that she would not get anything that could be guaranteed as the truth out of Andy, she insisted on 'demanding explanations' and now he's got her convinced that everything they had was real, and that a friend had dared him into the deception. So now, according to her, ""they are talking, and there's a lot of trust to rebuild.""

I'm saddened by the turn of events, but I did my job, and she's an adult who has to make her own choices. I'm trying to let go of the outcome, which obviously wasn't he one I hoped for, and to not feel hurt. I know she's going through a lot emotionally, and that it was silly to hope my intervention would change things. Hopefully, she'll see the truth of it sooner rather than later, and I can have played a part in that.

Tl;dr: I found the instagram of the real guy that Andy was stealing pics from, and took the information to my aunt to tell her she was being catfished. She cried, asked questions, I comforted for a few hours then left, advising her to cut off contact with him. Unfortunately she didn't, since then, he's told her 'it was a dare' and they are 'talking and rebuilding trust.'","Good on you for telling her, which had to be a hard experience.

relationships,My [25/F] boyfriend [30/M] has been texting nonstop with his friend’s wife [30s/F] for the past 2 weeks... weird or fine?,"My boyfriend has this group of friends who he has been friends with since middle school. I’ve been dating my boyfriend 7 months.


His friend is engaged to this girl and getting married this weekend. My boyfriend apparently said to his friend something like “Hey, I want to congratulate your wife-to-be and welcome her to the friend group, since you are like my brother, now she’s like my sister.”


When he initially told me this, I didn’t see it as a red flag. But last night, he comes out like this- “Babe, I need to tell you something. I’ve been texting with her every day” then proceeds to tell me she’s basically been gossiping and talking about random stuff to him. The way he said it sounded borderline confession-y imo. He started getting defensive and acting weird. I didn’t say anything to trigger that really, I just said “you know it’s interesting that you guys talk to eachother’s wives/girlfriends”(in a nice tone.)He goes “what do you mean by INTERESTING?!?!!” And proceeded to grill me and accuse me of being insecure over it. I said “let me make myself clear, I’m fine with you talking to her, text her as much as you want babe.” But his whole vibe continued to be off.


I wasn’t suspicious but now I’m starting to be. This isn’t the first time there’s been an issue with him excessively texting another girl all the time. I want to trust him but his behavior/attitude is making me uneasy. What do you think?

TLDR; is it “normal” for him to be texting her this much?

Edit: Everyone is saying to tell the friend and... As much as I would like to, there is no chance in hell. I can think of 99 ways that’ll backfire on me

Edit again: side detail- he asked me if I would be OK with my friends texting him. I told him I would not be comfortable with that. I told him if it works for some other women in their relationships, then that’s great and I respect that. But he should also respect that I would not like it if my friends texted him constantly. He proceeded to get heated and try to convince me that I’m wrong. I told him his vigor on the topic was bizarre because he’s never even met my friends and maybe i would re-evaluate when the time came.",[deleted],3315,209,2019-09-20 12:45:03,d6uds0

While I was in the home, we were mentally and physically abused by our stepfather.  We lived in trashy houses that were covered in actual garbage, including animal feces,  and just stuff EVERYWHERE. 
I havent heard from my youngest sister since May. I am pretty sure she has been told to cut contact with all of us (us being her older siblings). My second to youngest sister is overweight with spinal issues and is supposed to be dieting and seeing a specialist that they do not take her to see. 

I told the social worker that I wanted a check up on them because if previous deplorable conditions, and because I am not sure about any physical or mental abuse still happening in the home. It genuinely concerns me. I told them what happened with us (slammed into walls, things thrown at us, cussing, belittling our character... etc....) And told them repeatedly I really just want to know my little siblings dont have the same living conditions we had. 

My husband supported me through the call, and agreed it was the right thing to do. My siblings all discussed it ahead of time with the exception of my eldest sister who moved out before things got bad and the two who live in the house. We all agreed it would at the very extreme least let them know that they were being watched and we didnt just give up on them... and maybe my Mother and SD would keep a clean house, clean nose etc..

CPS contacted my mother very quickly.  Much faster than I anticipated. I mean within 3 hours.
Following this my eldest sister who lives states away and hasnt contacted me in months calls and shes freaking out on me because she ""knows Im the one who called"". I denied nothing and simply said, ""If they have nothing to hide, then they dont need to worry. Itll be over and done with pretty quickly "" to which she replied ""And if it isnt? If theyre taken away?"" I said ""Hopefully it doesnt come to that, and if it does it isnt on me. I didnt maltreat them. I didnt spread animal feces through the house. If they are clearly neglecting them, why should they have to stay in the house?"" I asked ""Would you let your children live like we did?"" She didnt answer.  I asked again, and she said ""No. Id keep a decent house but its not your job to tell someone else how to parent"".  I said ""Okay. So if this is all you called about, I think we're done here"". She told me we all needed to ""Get over what happened to us and move on with our lives!"" (She moved out long before the abuse started and wasnt around for any of it)

Regardless of my personal experience, I can't help but feel like I did something wrong. I have limited to no  contact with my Mother because of her husband, and she denies any abuse ever happened to any of us... My sister asked ""Why dont you just pop in and see the conditions?"" I told her ""I cant be around (my stepfather). I refuse to subject myself to that negativity again"" 

 While by husband and siblings agree it was the right thing to do... I still can't help feeling wrong for it.... like it ""wasnt my place"". But if it wasnt my place, whose was it? 
I really would like a third party outside opinion about what I did. 
Am wrong for reporting my family? Honestly, should I of just kept my mouth shut?


I don't mind having no contact with my Mother or eldest sister.  They dont even know Im nearly 4 months pregnant because of how very very little we talk as it is.  So the potential of never really having a relationship doesnt bug me really. What bugs me is not knowing if I was in the right. 


TL;DR
I called cps on my mother based on previous experience with being abused mentally and physically from our step father. I havent heard from my younger siblings in a while because communication had been cut. We lived with deplorable conditions, animal feces, garbage and clutter everywhere, being hit, having things thrown at us, etc. I told cps that I wasnt sure if anything was for sure happening still because again, we dont have contact, but that I wanted them to check on my siblings.  Was I totally out of line?


Edit - 
I really appreciate the overwhelming response. I didnt expect this to get much attention. 
I will post an update as soon as there is an update to post. Again, I really really appreciate the responses","Your sister has to believe that it wasn't your responsibility or purvue to call CPS on your mother, because otherwise she would have to confront the fact that she never did this to protect you, when you were abused. She has to believe that it wasn't so bad for you after she left, because otherwise she abandoned you and your siblings. 

And she can't face that guilt. You have to be the bad one to her, so she can preserve her sense of self and innocence.

Thank you and a hug from an anonymous internet stranger. You are a great person for taking action!

relationships,My sister (17f) is weird about my (20f) relationship with my younger brother (14m),"My brother and I hang out a lot. We are both very into playing video games, sports, and movies. We play smash together, we go to the movies about once a month, and once in a while he stays over at my house to play video games and watch TV with me. My sister and I aren’t as close. She is more into makeup, and isn’t interested in video games much if at all. She also works as a waitress when she isn’t at school, typically 6-8 hours a day on the weekends. I still love her just as much as my brother, I just don’t think we have many common interests at this point in our lives, and our availability doesn’t match up much. I found out from my mom today that the last time I hung out with my brother, she told my parents that she feels like I don’t like her because I don’t spend as much time with her as I do with my brother. How can I make her feel more included in what my brother and I are doing, without making it too obvious that I know what she told my parents? Or should I just take her to lunch one day and tell her I know what she told them, and that she is always welcome to hang out with me?


TLDR: Sister is feeling left out because my brother and I hang out often and she doesn’t/isn’t able to join. How do I make it clear to her she is welcome to hang out with me/us any time?

EDIT: Thanks for all the input guys. I reached out to her and we are going to a cider mill this week together, just her and I. I appreciate the insight/perspective and ideas for things to do with her","It's just easier for you to bond with your little bro because you guys share so many interests - if you are interested in building a stronger relationship with your lil sis, maybe try doing something she likes once in a while....or just take her someone to walk and talk, and when you think you can slip in that you'd love to see her over at your place more often, and that she's more than welcome - she's invited, if that's what she needs to hear! - to come over.",3240,79,2019-10-07 15:09:45,dekqs8
relationships,“UPDATE” I (20f) am seeing red flags in bf (20m),"Original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/e7dvso/i_20f_am_seeing_red_flags_in_my_current_partner/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

So I got the courage to talk to him over text (I didn’t want to wait any longer because I haven’t been sleeping past couple of nights). I told him I wanted more communication in the relationship and told him that we could work on it together if he wanted. Essentially he told me he wanted to breakup. Didn’t want to be with me at that time because he needed to find himself and didn’t want to drag me down. Said he needed to do it by himself and he didn’t want me help. So I said that if he really wanted to end it we need to talk on the phone. So after he got off work, he called and we ended it. I told him that I’d be there for him if he needed someone to talk to. Told him he was a good guy and that I liked him as a person. He told me he wasn’t ready for a relationship right now, but he might be in the future. I put my foot down and said that I wasn’t going to wait for him. I needed that phone call for closure and to move on. I need some encouragement advice lol.  I know I’ll be fine as I’ve been through breakups before. It just hurts right now. To me, he seemed like a decent guy. But I guess things don’t always go our way.

TLDR: broke up with bf of 4 months. Said he didn’t want to be in a relationship right now. I am heartbroken.","You recognized the red flags, opened a dialogue, discussed them maturely and reached an amicable conclusion. Honestly you're doing fucking great, and you  should run this sub cause you're a hell of a lot more mature than some people here.

You sound like a strong, grounded and aware person. It sucks right now, but you're gunna be fine. And when you find the right person, they're going to be very lucky.

relationships,UPDATE: Is it wrong for me(F20) to choose my friendship with my ex(M22) over the guy I’m dating now(M23)?,"Original Post is here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ae6inj/is_it_wrong_for_mef20_to_choose_my_friendship/

Thanks to all the people who gave me their advice and perspective on the matter, it was greatly appreciated and helped me sort my priorities out.

 First, let me clear up some things I probably should have made clearer in the original post:

The thing with the mind reading is not really meant to be taken as a soul mate situation. Ben sometimes struggles to get a point across but I seem to get it most of the times and can tell people what he meant to say. So I think this got blown out of proportion a bit. I should have phrased this differently, sorry.

Also, many people referred to Chris as my boyfriend in their comments, which he was not. We were dating for a month and weren’t an official couple.

Another thing I should have talked about is how Ben and I ended up dating for a second time. An acquaintance told us that it was a shame that us dating never worked out and we decided to test the waters again. Not even a month in I said that it did not feel right, he agreed and said how relived he was that I felt it too and we went back to being friends. That was considerably easy since we hadn’t even had sex in that month. Chris knew that the second time wasn’t all that serious.

One comment was suspicious of why Ben hadn’t moved on so I probably should‘ve mentioned that Ben had a girlfriend from February to June 2018. I liked her and she was always lovely to me. She left him because, ironically, she still had feelings for her ex. So I thought it‘d be safe to assume that he‘d be over me as well.

None of my close friends talked about my history with Ben and they didn’t joke about us at the party. They genuinely want me to be happy and most of them instantly liked Chris. However something did happen at the party that ended up causing all this mess. So buckle up folks.

Now that that’s been said, let’s move on to the shit show that’s been my life for the last couple of days.

After reading some of your comments I texted Chris back and agreed to talk about things that night under the condition that we both will be civil and adult about it. He was fine with that and I came over to his place.

Chris started the conversation by immediately apologizing for how aggressive he reacted and how stupid he felt for not being able to keep it together. He said it wasn’t fair of him to mistrust me and that his jealousy was ridiculously overblown considering we weren’t even official.

I told him that it’s okay if he gets jealous or uncomfortable but I just wished we could have talked about it before things escalated. I apologized for not being sensitive enough to realize that no matter what he said to me, he wouldn’t exactly be thrilled with the situation. I could have made more of an effort to reassure him and adapt situations so that we could both be happy.

We both made it clear that it would make us sad if things ended before they had even begun and we’d probably end up regretting not giving this another shot. After all, we have this crazy chemistry and got along so well.

Now all that seemed to stand in the way of a happy ending was an awkward conversation about my friendship with Ben. But before I could even get into it Chris dropped this bomb:

So at the party he overheard Ben and his best friend talking. Ben said how awful it was to see me with another guy and how unfair it was that we weren’t an item.
Chris did not know what to do with that. He said that that’s where what little jealousy and insecurity he had went from zero to a hundred and he couldn’t help seeing red. He weight his options and thought that if he’d tell me it’d end in a situation where it’s his word against Ben’s and I’d believe Ben more. He also didn’t want to be “that guy that ruined a friendship“. So he swallowed his feelings until they burst out when I casually mentioned hanging out with Ben.

As he told me that, I put my guard up and took it with more than just a grain of salt. That story sounded almost cartoonishly convenient. Some people in the comments warned me that he could try to manipulate me and I had to look out for myself. I told him in all honesty that I‘d have to talk to some other people as it was hard to take his word for it given the current situation.

Chris was very understanding and told me that to whatever solution I‘d come, he‘d have to accept it because as he put it he “lost the right to be involved in this with throwing a jealous fit“. I disagreed but he was adamant about me having to find my truth.

We ended the night with me telling him that I really wanted to trust in what he said to me for the sake of salvaging our relationship but it was just so hard and I was so confused. He again said that he understands and that I should take my time to sort things out. Then he gave me a long hug (yes, this one was actually long) and I left to figure things out.

And oh boy did I figure things out...

The first thing that came into my head was that at the party in September, the one where I was dared to kiss Ben, guess who thought of the dare. It was Ben‘s best friend, who, if I‘d take Chris’ word, would know if Ben still had feelings for me. Ben’s friend was also the person who suggested playing truth or dare in the first place even though he usually doesn’t like that many drinking/party games.

Then I thought about how weird Ben acted when I asked him about Chris. At the time I was convinced that he just didn’t want to hurt my feelings but what if he just saw his chance of getting Chris out of the picture and held an inner debate whether he should act on it or not.

My head was in bits and pieces as I overanalysed basically every interaction I had with Ben for the past months. I had to rip the band aid off and talk to Ben directly. So I asked him if he’d be free after work and he came over. We usually don’t spend time alone at each other’s place so he knew that something wasn’t quite right.

It was very awkward but I had carefully thought about what to say beforehand which made it a bit easier. I told Ben that I value our friendship but had gotten the suspicion that he might want more out of our relationship than I could give him and asked if this was true. Ben is a bad liar so he got defensive instead and asked me if Chris wanted to separate us. He used that phrasing. “Separate us”

I told him that it did not matter if Chris was involved in this because I just wanted a clear answer on whether us being friends was enough for him or not. He avoided the answer. Asking again if this was because of Chris. He spun in circles trying to change the subject and ended up saying some mean things about Chris not being a good person and what not (Reminder that their first and only interaction had been at the party). I however stayed focused, as I wanted an answer. Given, his avoiding of my question was answer enough but I was getting angry with him and I wanted him to spell it out.

After some more back and forth he finally snapped: “Fine! I thought that we’d eventually get back together and it was only a matter of time until you realized that we were meant to be! You should be with me then we wouldn’t have to deal with this.” His words still echo in my head.

Like, what…? I could have handled him having a little crush on me or if he felt that some things were left unresolved, but this? It felt like my entire world was shattered. All these years of friendship he just stuck around to one day get back together with me? Everything we’ve been through and everything he did for me was just so that I’d eventually realize that we should date again?

I told him that I couldn’t return his feelings. Not now and not in the future. We had tried twice, it didn’t work out, at least for me it didn’t, and I saw nothing that could change that. I wanted us to be friends but I don’t think it is possible under these conditions.

He got pretty worked up about it and it was like watching someone go through all stages of grief except acceptance. “We can still work this out!” “This is unfair!” “Nobody will ever love me!” “I’ll change and we can try again in a few months!”

It took a lot out of me but I remained calm and told him that it’d be better if we stopped seeing each other for quite some time. Then I asked him to leave. I was exhausted and honestly creeped out. I felt so betrayed. This person that I was so close to and that I trusted so much was always acting with an ulterior motive.

I called my best friend and once she heard me sob through the speaker she got in her car and came over. I told her what had happened and she was horrified. She had no idea. As word spread in these last two days it turned out that my friends didn’t know about his feelings either and most of them were shocked and repelled by how he acted.

I got some amazing support from my friends and they were great at helping me not losing my head over this so far.
Chris and I talked yesterday and I apologized for putting him in such a horrible situation. I hadn’t wanted for us to start out with this level of drama. He believes that I wasn’t to blame but I still think I should have realized some things earlier... it’s been five years of “friendship” for Christ‘s sake...

Chris was very sweet. He ordered food from my favourite take out place, we watched a movie and cuddled up on the sofa. He said that he was glad that we came out okay and somehow everything was worth the struggle in the end. He also asked if I wanted to be his girlfriend and I said yes.

So tl;dr: Ben had feelings for me for years and expected that I’d just get back together with him one day. I told him that I couldn’t be friends with him if that’s what he wants. Chris and I are now an official couple and can’t wait for a drama free relationship.","Honestly, this is a pretty comfortable example of how easy it can be for an unbiased stranger to look at a situation and see what's really going on.

relationships,Update to: my(28) girlfriend(29) moved in and quit her job,"https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ai95d4/girlfriend29_moved_in_and_quit_her_job/ 

Well last time I was here my girlfriend had to quit her job. But Had said she would still be able to pay rent with her residual income. The time came and she was late. And only paid a third of what she needed to.

Well I can’t move right now. Luckily my name is primary on the lease. And She is legally subletting with me. I went over a new lease agreement. And it has a weekly amount she has to pay me to catch up on rent and continue paying rent.

If she preaches this contract in accordance with my state law. She will be evicted. She refuses to talk to me. She refuses to leave her room. I told her that I don’t hate her and I still deeply care about her. But she has to pay or else she has to leave and I’ll find someone else to rent the second bedroom.

The place we rented have rooms for each of us so that we could have a private space as well as time with each other. If she’s not able to pay I’m planning on affecting her and finding someone else to rent.

My heart is broken. With the planning this for over a year. And I know she’s depressed. But she could go back to work tomorrow and make double what I do a day. With a career she’s in she could still go back to work even after having quit.

I loved her so much. And we had built detailed and amazing plans together. But she’s just stopped moving.

I know she’s depressed but I don’t know what to do for her. I’ve tried talking to her I’ve tried offering to help her. I’ve offered to take her to a doctor. I’ve told her that I’m there for her. But I can’t do this for her. It’s like she’s just given up.

And I love her, but this is not the agreement that we had together. If she was willing to go see a doctor I would at least be able to work with her. And find a way to make this work. But I can’t support somebody who sick and refuses to go see help. It’s been a month and a half since she moved and it’s been a disaster.

I feel like there should’ve been warning signs but there wasn’t. It’s like a flip switched and she’s turned into a different person. I’ve lost my girlfriend. It’s like she’s dead and there’s this shell standing in front of me.

I don’t know what else to do... i’ve given her all I can afford to give emotionally and monetarily and unless she’s willing to help her self I’m done.

TLDR: girlfriend did not pay the rent she promised she would. And has severe depression. I’ve tried to help her and I have no more to give.","The most important thing to know is that **you are not her therapist.** You are not someone who is equipped to deal with whatever issues she has going on. You are her partner, and frankly unless she agrees to go get help (visit a doctor, find a good therapist) you will have to either end things or be dragged down financially and emotionally. The best you can do right now is encourage her to get help and be willing to just validate her feelings and make her feel loved, while making sure she can function. This could be anything from depression to bipolar, only a doctor can say for sure. Best of luck OP, this is an awful situation to be in.",3137,89,2019-02-03 19:04:17,amspap
relationships,update: I [16M] got into an argument with my older brother [26M] and told him he'll never measure up to our deceased father,"i though i would provide an update to my [first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/azopg2/i_16m_got_into_an_argument_with_my_older_brother/). 

someone advised me that i write my brother a letter apologizing, which i did. i apologized for being mean and hurtful, and that I was wrong for doing that. i also got him a separate card and wrote a message thanking him for everything he's done for me. I went to his house with my letter and card when I found out he was home to go talk to him, but unfortunately when I got there he was gone already, so I slid them under the door. 

When he got back home he found them and read them, and then he called me to arrange to come see me. He came over here and I apologized in person for what I said. He was very straightforward with me and honest about my actions. He explained that the reason he had been avoiding me lately is because he needed some time apart because he was beginning not to like me. He said loved me, but I he didn't want to be around me sometimes.

That was pretty hard to hear. He said that lately I've just been not very nice, the comment about our Dad was by far the worst, but I make other snappy comments. He had tried to brush it off as me being 'just as teenager', but had now decided it was best to let me know. ""Being a teenager is not an excuse to be a constant asshole to everybody at home"", is how he put it. He gave a few examples and looking back he was absolutely right. 

It was pretty upsetting to hear. I know he wasn't saying it to upset me, and I was thankful that he was telling me (or at least I'm thankful now). I promised that I would check my attitude, he said a little more thoughtfulness was all I needed, and that even though sometimes I act like an asshole he knows I'm not one. After we finished talking we hugged, he told me not to forget that he loves me and that I'm great. 

Since then I've been trying to be more considerate. I really am trying to follow the advice he gave me. It's been a couple months now, and I'm happy to say that it's working. Our mom told me a couple weeks ago that Im a joy to be around. In the car earlier today my brother told me that its been really nice spending time with me lately. so thats good news. 

TL;DR apologized to my brother for the terrible thing I said to him. he warned me that I was turning into someone that he didn't want to be around, even though he loved me. i've worked on fixing my attitude over the past two months, and today my brother told me its nice to hang out with me these days.

 Edit: wow, wasn’t expecting this to get big. Thanks for the advice, and for the gold. Much appreciated.","Hey man, I had a similar experience - when I was 16 my group of friends essentially had an intervention and let me know my defensiveness and argumentativeness was driving them away. Now, nearing 30, I am beyond grateful that I had friends who had the guts to be honest with me and give me a chance. I asked them to point out when I was doing it and respected them when they did.

Now I make a point of inviting quiet people to speak in groups because I am aware that people like me drown out important voices that may be too timid to speak up when a bunch of loudmouths like myself are arguing. That one conversation changed my life for the better. I am glad you are being given the opportunity to see how  your behaviour affects others from another perspective. You will slip up, but growing up is all about generally trending upward in behaviour, not being perfect!",3106,63,2019-05-23 02:07:12,brxhuk
relationships,What to do about my (18) brother(23) and his toxic fiance (22),"Hey all. So my brother and his fiance have been together for around 7 years now. To be honest we didn't start off great to begin with, my family and I were really nice with her and tried to treat her like part of the family. But she was just weird with us, she didn't talk to us or eat in front of us. If we went out for dinner she demanded that her and my brother have a separate table away from the rest of the family. She didn't let him go on vacation with us.

She did a lot of different shit over the years, if I was talking to them and she wanted to eat they would just kick me out of the room. When our parents were away she purposefully left a mess that I would have to clean up. Planned her birthday party on the day of my birthday so he couldn't go. Rummaging through my room while I was gone. Petty stuff like that. But what was worse was what she's done to my brother, when he got with her he had a lot of friends, he's always been a happy go lucky, outgoing person. But she stopped letting him see his friends and going to family get togethers. (My other brother and sister live in a different city so we don't see them often)

About two years ago they both moved in together in a city 3 hours away for university. We see him once every one or two months now which is okay. But she doesn't let him go out or have friends, which just seems so bizarre to me, I feel like he should be enjoying himself in university, but she just has him cleaning the apartment all the time.

The latest thing that's happened was that my sister (27)  had an engagement party. My brother's fiance came out with this demand that either they go home with her friend before the party or that my parents drive them home (again, 6 hour drive all in all) afterwards. Oh, and she wasn't even going to the party, just him. Basically just she wasn't letting him go, she wanted to ruin the party for my sister. 

He ended up going regardless and as punishment, she ignored him on the phone for two days, and that he was allowed to come home when she was away to work. 

Another thing is that she's been trying to plan their wedding, even though he's expressed openly that he doesn't want to get married yet. She texted my mum from his phone (he's dyslexic and doesn't type the way she did in the text) demanding that my parents would have to give them £4,000 for the wedding.

Just to clarify, this isn't some petty thing just because he's my brother. I adore my other brother's boyfriend and sister's fiance, they fit so well into the family. My family have tried so hard to make my brother's fiance fit in and feel comfortable.

I don't know what to do now, he reconciled with her as soon as he went home. I don't want to associate with either of them anymore, I just feel like they bring in too much stress. Is it childish for me to just stop talking to them? The thing that pisses me off most is the engagement thing, my sister has gone through a lot and is the one person who deserves to  be happy, it hurts to know that my brother's fiance wanted to ruin that for her.

TLDR: Brother's fiance controls his every move, including which friends and family he sees. Didn't let my brother go to sister's engagement party. Brother is too immature and doesn't stand up for himself. I need some advice on how to deal with them.

Sorry for the super long post but I feel like you needed that context 😅 Thanks in advance!

Edit: Thank you all so much for your advice and responses. I'm sorry to hear that some of you have been through something similar.

Just to explain a little more, my family didn't just lie back and let this happen, they've tried so many times to help and make him see that this behaviour isn't normal but I think he's too far deep. 

He's told us that he isn't happy and I can tell he hasn't been happy for a while. He's tried to get her to change mutliple times, even asked her to go to therapy but she always gets around him again.","Wow, this girl is horrible and abusive. I can’t blame you for wanting nothing to do with her, but have you expressed these concerns to your brother?",3061,101,2019-07-18 10:29:05,ceqq7u

I barely received any replies but I'm grateful to the ones that gave me advice.

Unfortunately, I found out two days ago that he had other girls he was using as backup girlfriends and I - as embarrassing as it sounds - flipped my shit and I left him. The reason he started being less affectionate with me was, apparently, because he was sharing / outsourcing his emotional needs to other girls while not fulfilling mine.

So, that's the end of a 3.5 years relationship.

I'm feeling strangely well although it happened recently so maybe it hasn't hit me yet. I'm more angry than anything else.

Thank you for reading, r/relationships!

**TL;DR:** The lack of affection was, apparently, because he was entertaining other girls in case we didn't work out so I left him.

(Reposted because I forgot summary)

**Edit:** Wow, this really blew up. I was spending time with my family and haven't checked my post. Thank you for the encouragements, advice and gold. I'll try to answer as many questions as I can.","Why are you embarrassed you left him? Cheating is never worth forgiving. You both are young, it would be amazing if it lasted forever. People really like variety. And while many things can be worked on, a lot of things can not. It's natural to grow apart.

relationships,How do I tell my narcissist mother (65F) that I (29F) already bought my wedding dress?,"My fiance and I are getting married over the summer (we've been together 4 years). We decided on a very informal courthouse wedding and the two of us decided to elope/honeymoon internationally after. Well, this was heartbreaking to our parents and my mom threw a fit and tried to bargain and bully her way into getting her way. I gathered all of my strength from the spirit of past r/relationships posts and put my foot down. I had a change of heart a few months later though.  I have a good relationship with my MIL and I wanted her to be able to see us get married. Fiance and I decided to invite the parents for the weekend of our courthouse wedding. We planned some photos and simple dinner and THAT'S IT.

My mom of course took this as an invitation to start planning a wedding for us with a fancy cake and extravagant dinner. I just let her make these plans and not acknowledging them, instead reiterating my own. It seems to be working so far, except when it comes to the dress.

Backstory: My mom has always used money as a tool for emotional manipulation. Even when I was a child, she would spend her ""last dollars"" on something and bring it up FOREVER. She would talk about how she was poor and didn't have any clothes without holes in them because of me and my medical bills or things that I ""wanted"".  She would tell people on the street that she couldn't afford a haircut or dental work because of me. I separated myself from my parents financially as soon as I got to college and have a lot of debt as a result. I really couldn't handle the constant guilt trips even if it meant working full-time my freshman year. I stopped asking for anything at a young age and I still have a huge aversion to asking anyone for anything or receiving gifts. A few years ago, my parents took a page from Wesley Snipes' book and are now in a pretty bad financial situation. This makes my mom even more of a martyr when she sends me (unsolicited) gifts.

The first time I told her about the wedding, she said, ""I don't have any money, but the dress is MINE!"" meaning she would buy it for me. She talked up the experience and is clearly looking forward to shopping with me. I don't mind the shopping aspect, but I don't want her to make this all about the sacrifice she made for my ""special day"". I will literally have to hear about this for the rest of her life  -  ""Remember when I spent my last few pennies on your dress. I had to eat rice for a month afterward and I couldn't afford my medication, but you looked so lovely!"" I don't want to think about how much of a fucking narcissist my mom is every time I look at my wedding photos.

I started doing some preliminary online shopping and found sample dress on sale for $100 down from $500! I ordered it and it's arriving today. Assuming it fits and looks okay, this is the one. 

Here's the problem: My mom is coming to visit for the first time in a year and dress shopping is at the top of her list.

I'm so stressed out about what to say. I know I need to tell her that I bought a dress already, but I really just want to lie or avoid this whole situation. Anyone who's dealt with a narcissist knows how she's going to turn this around on me so I'm the asshole, and blow this whole thing out of proportion.  I never really developed a healthy relationship or mechanisms to deal with her and I just avoid situations like these to keep peace. My best idea so far was to tell her I found the dress at Goodwill. What's wrong with me???

I know I need to tell her, but what's the best way to approach this with the least amount of explosion? How do I stand up for myself without being a total dick? I believe in speaking my mind and doing what you want, I just don't want to deal with this fallout.

TL;DR:  I'm still a child at nearly 30 who is scared to tell her mom that she bought a dress.","Wanting to avoid unnecessary drama (even if you aren't the one being unnecessary) isn't childish, it's just reasonable. But you also can't really avoid it.

""Oh, we can skip shopping, I found a really amazing deal on a dress so you don't have to worry about it! What do you think about chinese for dinner?"" Repeat ad nauseum. Redirect immediately. Mention that you would feel guilty if your mom put herself out just for a dress, and then ask if she heard about that new netflix show. When she presses, and she will press, brush her off. ""Mom, I already told you I got the dress taken care of, so you really don't have to stress about it. I've been meaning to ask, what's your book club up to?""

Honestly I don't think this is a situation you can ""win"", just one you can manage. She's a narcissist, there's no outmaneuvering that, so if you're committed to her being involved your best bet is to just be cheerful teflon and act like she's being silly when she tries to pitch a fit about it. She's going to act like you're being unreasonable or mean to her either way, you can't stop that, but you can keep from giving her the attention and drama she's looking for.",3010,153,2019-05-01 14:48:50,bjhxpk
relationships,My wife [28F] found out that my mother [59F] and I [28M] have been lying to her about our baby [0M] for months,"This all went down about an hour ago and my wife is still crying in our bathroom with the door locked. 

Backstory: We had our son (now 11 months old) while my wife is in residency. She took a few weeks off before giving birth, and then went back to work a few months after, while I transitioned my hours to part-time so that I could stay at home and raise our son. My mom moved in with us shortly after the birth in order to help out, which allows me to get in the few hours of work per day and also not get swamped with taking care of the baby/housework. She's quite old-fashioned and would definitely not prefer this arrangement with me being a stay-at-home dad, but she hasn't said anything to either of us and has been a great help.

For anyone unfamiliar with medical residency, it is *brutal*. My wife has just over a year left. Sometimes she comes and goes for 1-3 days and our son is asleep the whole time she's home, which has been happening more as his sleep schedule shifted to sleeping through the night. My mom and I make sure that when she's home and the baby is awake, my wife gets him 100%. I know it's been hard on her, but unfortunately it's just going to be this way for another year.

The first big milestone she missed was him rolling over. When she got home, my mom pulled her over to the baby all excited. I thought she was going to tell her, but instead she says ""Julie, you came home right on time! He's been moving about as if he's going to roll over!"" They both stood there encouraging him, and right on cue he rolls. My wife was *elated*. She was so worried and guilty about not being there and she took it as proof that she can still be a present mother while working. 

So we continued. I send texts over little things she misses through the day so that it's not completely unbelievable, but my wife has been 'present' for every single BIG milestone. He coincidentally started crawling with her right there, his first words were in front of her, and he began standing, cruising, and walking when she happened to be home. The walking one was difficult- there was a tough 7 day stretch where she just wasn't home during the daytime when he was awake, and his walking went from teetering to walking a couple steps pretty confidently in that time. We put little beanbags in one of his pants pockets so he'd be wobbly and unbalanced and it looked believable since he fell after the first step like he was doing a week ago. Yes, it was mean to our poor son but my wife's face was worth it.

Today it all unravelled. So far he can just say 'mama', 'dada' and 'nana'. Yesterday he started saying 'bye-bye'. My wife has today off and has been home all morning. My mom and I have been trying to get him to say bye all day without giving it away that we already know he can say bye. Successfully got him to say bye to the ducks at the park, and we both gushed over his newest word the whole way home. My wife was using my phone to take pictures of him and began showing my mom at home while telling her about his newest word acquisition. She was swiping through my gallery and saw a video from yesterday and goes ""oh you never sent me this one!"" It was literally like a slow motion film happening in front of my eyes. I had taken the video of him yesterday waving bye-bye.

My wife isn't an idiot. She figured the whole ruse out pretty much instantly. I've never seen her look so upset and heartbroken before. I couldn't say or do anything to comfort her. Now she's locked herself in the bathroom crying and won't come out. I'm on our bed hoping someone can please tell me what to do to make this better.

&#x200B;

**tl,dr:** my mom and I lied to my wife about our son's milestones for months, and she just found out.

&#x200B;",Oh god the title read as if you and your mom had a baby together and I was like dying so this didn’t seem as bad after thinking that,2975,12,2019-03-09 17:58:30,az648p

She blew up at me last night and I felt like our arguments were becoming too frequent. We're meeting on Tues to have a final chat as I said I'm open to getting back with her if she changes but I'm not holding out my hope.

Its hard to leave when I love her so much but sadly love doesn't equal a healthy relationship.

Thanks to everyone in this subreddit that helped me to see the manipulation from her and her immaturity. Shit sucks but I'll survive.

I'm on my phone but I wanted to give an update because people like them.
First off, thank you for all the replies. Emotional manipulation is hard especially in a relationship. For me, I like to see the goodness in people and I trust people, which are great qualities, it can also set me up as a target. Thank you for confirming what I was seeing and feeling, it's difficult to see these abuse tactics from inside, so much so that you start to actually think what this person is speaking truth because why would they tell you differently. I mean why would your partner be intentionally hurtful?

On to the update

I didn't want to ghost him because I think that's mean so I sent him a short text that said ""I don't feel that we should see each other anymore. I wish you the best of luck.""

He sent me a couple of wtf texts, with the last one saying ""you didn't honor your promise to me. I'm not trying to hurt your feelings but you don't keep promises."" Followed up with ""I'm a really awesome person, you'll come to your senses and figure it out. Let me know when you are brave enough to be an adult relationship."" Ending with that ""I don't deserve to be treated this way and I will not tolerate it but you're amazing and I love you. Please don't contact me again"" 

There was more, it was pretty lengthy but that's the core of the message.

I read it and said oh okay, don't worry to myself and blocked him.

So not a big drama, it's just over and I'm done. I'm going to take some time to myself and do some home projects that I've been meaning to work on and enjoy the holidays with my friends and family.

Tl,Dr I broke with him and said some stuff, I blocked him and taking time for myself


ETA:I just woke up and was reading all the comments while drinking my morning coffee. I wanted to say thank you to all of you for your kind words. I'm really touched by your words of encouragement and shared experiences. 

Thank you to the kind stranger for the gold! 

We don't know each other but I truly feel like I have a hundred people in my corner supporting me, it's feels really good. So thank you!

I also want to let you all know that I have blocked him on all forms of communication IG, FB, text, email, the works! But I'm totally prepared if he ever tries to reach out again, I think silence is the best road to take on this one. 

Thank you again for the support, it means more than I can express. I hope all of you have a wonderful holiday and 2020 is everything that you want it to be!","I honestly felt kind of proud reading this update. Good for you! I think you’re really putting your foot down and showing yourself that you won’t accept to be treated badly, and only good things can stem from that.

relationships,I [28M] don't want my MIL or my other in-laws to help with our baby anymore unless she changes. How do I convey this to me without causing a rift?,"My husband [30M] and I [28M] have a 6 week old baby daughter. I am currently a stay at home dad and taking on most of the childcare. Occasionally my MIL has been helping me out but it has been causing a lot more stress than usual since she has been staying over and sleeping in our guest room.

Those past weeks we have been dealing a lot with baby colic. She has been difficult to comfort unless I hold her and she does get very upset when my MIL holds her. My MIL is a lovely woman but you can't explain that to a baby. I have been trying to explain to MIL that I appreciate her help around the house a lot, feeding times, laundry (baby's clothes). I have been telling her that but when it comes to the baby crying her head off I'd appreciate if she let's me hold her. When I tell her that, especially when the baby is crying and clearly wants me to hold her, my MIL gets visibly upset. Close to crying even because she thinks I'm pushing her granddaughter away from her. 

This mainly comes from her refusing to respect that I don't want her to kiss the baby on her lips, which is a disgusting habit my SIL also participates in. My MIL invites my SIL over as well to coo over the baby despite my daughter crying because of colic and overstimulation. She's not used to any of this. 

My husband is not backing me up on this because of course it's his mother so now I have to talk to her without causing a rift.

Tl;dr MIL and SIL do not respect boundaries regarding my daughter of 6 weeks. If this continues I'd rather exclude them for a while. How can we fix this?","Your problem isn't your MIL or SIL, it's your partner.  You need to sit him down and have this out with him.  He then needs to handle his family.",2873,114,2019-04-23 14:26:33,bgh020
relationships,"I[32F] feel like my husband[33M] is in denial about his feelings towards me. Married 11 years with 2 special needs kids, I got fat and dead bedroom... How can I fix things with him?","If you saw this yesterday I apologize it was taken down because I somehow fat fingered something to look like a link thu breaking a rule, and while I had great responses I was unable to reply etc.

**TL;DR:** 2 special needs kids. SAHM to basically be able to do all the therapies and appointments. Am huge now. Husband never has sex with me but swears he loves me and is attracted to me. Works late and very little interaction. Feel like he's with me not to be the asshole who leaves his wife with 2 special needs kids. Didn't celebrate my birthday and mother's day was not much better.  He may be on the spectrum a well. **\*\*How can i fix this mess esp the dead bedroom/lack of love?\*\***

We've been married 11 years. High school sweethearts...well started dating right after high school. Not each other's first boyfriend/girlfriend but I've only had sex with him.

Jack and I have been married for 11 years. We have two kids. Both of our kids had special needs with our oldest being extremely high functioning and gifted and our younger child being in the moderate category for autism. Our youngest is 4.

Jack is a very successful person and while I had a promising career when our oldest child had issues we decided since I made less and had better medical background I would stay home. He was happy to do this as his own mom stayed home but it was hard for me as I always saw myself working and being successful. I'm being vague because he does read this sub. I took our oldest to all therapies and was an aide in preschool for him. Honestly without driving it was over a part time job and some years over a full time job.

My life became all about pushing this child uphill and itworked Now you would never know he had severe challenges. He still gets social therapy and needs anxiety help but really he just seems like a super smart child,

We were both still very much in love and decided to have our second child. This was before we knew our older one had aspbergers. Our oldest was diagnosed when our younger child was mere months old. With a newborn I still did all of the therapy, driving and preschool stuff with my older. Around age 2.5 it became apparent while our younger child was hitting milestones he regressed. He is one of the small percentage of children who regress after the age of two. I admit this fucked with me bad and I was suicidal. I was put on medication and am dealing well with it but I felt like my child was stolen. to go from fully verbal and conversational to mute and right when his brother was graduating all his therapies save social skills therapy was a huge mind fuck. I was gutted. I began putting on more weight and my eating for comfort got out of control. I'm now trying I sti to accept where our youngest is and take happiness in what strides he is making. l take on childcare and therapies. I'm never home long enough to clean and organize it and when I am I'm usually so beat and tired to organize the toys they dump etc. Forget spring cleaning it never happens. My husband was always messy so it just adds to it being a shithole of clutter(not filth the trash is taken out and dishes done but messy clutter and unwashed walls with kid prints on it). I feel I never get a break. He is worse off than his brother in many ways but he is also the happiest kid.

When we got married I was 130lbs and 5'8. Looking back I think I was extremely attractive but had poor self esteem as I was not American ideals and was bullied a lot for my ""ethnic looks"". After our first was born I struggled to lose weight but I did. After our second I was losing weight until my oldest was diagnosed with aspbergers. I then comfort ate. Currently I am 260lbs. The heaviest I have ever been. I'm on depression medication. Our house is a mess, I'm always stressed out and just exhausted. Jack has always been overweight but it never bothered me. I'm talking around 220 most of his adult life and he is 5'9. He is now 245. He does have some health stuff but it's minor and not severe. His professional life is super bright but due to our children's needs you wouldn't tell how well he is doing for himself.

My birthday he ""forgot"" because I was depressed and did not want to go out due to my younger child being kicked out of a preschool so we didn't even cut a store bought cake. His birthday came around and he got himself something expensive and nice and I also got him a nice gift and card. I planned a surprise party for him. I'm trying to have the kids make him a father's day gift. I make sure every day to tell him how much I adore him and love him.

I feel unloved. We never have sex anymore. The kids reject him because he barely interacts-if I am honest he may have aspbergers himself- so I am putting them to bed. I ask him and he says he's tired or work or whatever else excuse. Today he turned down a bj. Not even a bodily response when I was trying to initiate it. He says it's just the kids, stress, work, exhaustion, his back hurts literally everything.

He swears he loves me and is attracted to me still but the lack of sex unless I literally beg him bothers me. He jacks off so I know it's not a testosterone thing. I've offered counseling and he says he loves me and doesn't know where it is coming from. I'm starting to feel like we're married because I am a SAHM and can bring our special needs kid to 100000 appointments and he worries if we divorce who would do it not to mention he probably would feel bad if he left me because our kids.

I love him so much but either he is in denial or I am crazy. I want to stay married to him. I don't think I could ever love someone the way I love him but I don't think he loves me anymore- and again he swears he does. I just don't get how we would have sex every day then every other day after our first was born then three times a week after our second was born to now I'm lucky if I get it twice a month and I have to harass him for it. He doesn't initiate it. It kills me because I just feel ugly. I also suspect he is upset the house went to hell but I feel like I can't keep up both my kids are in therapies granted my oldest who is gifted is just in a private social group but still I never have a break.

He works until 8pm most weekdays and I feel it may be a choice. When he gets home he's on his computer or takes hours on the bathroom where he hides from us. When he is home he seems irritated with everything. We do date nights a few times a month but it's either silent or me filling conversation. I'm so lost and I don't know where to start. When I ask him what I need to do or how I can fix this he reassures me he loves me and is just tired and nothing is broken.

I was raised by a single mom so I really don't know what to do here and if I am being crazy. I'm too ashamed to ask my female friends because they joke their husbands bug them for sex too much and they are tired. Is it normal to have a super dead bedroom for over a year in long relationships? I just want to fix this. I love him.","I’m so sorry. Reading all of that, of course you feel down.

You said he makes a good living, yes? Could y’all afford for a maid to come in, just once a week, to tidy up the house?

Better yet, maybe hire a professional caretaker to handle the kids for 1-2 days per week. Taking them to appointments, taking care of their needs, etc.

If you could free up just a bit of time for yourself, where you can handle other household tasks, prep healthy meals that can be stored in the freezer for the rest of the week, or even just go do something you used to love for a while, I think the entire energy of the home could be changed. You just need help.

One idea could be that you hire a maid, yes, and then also hire a professional caretaker to take care of your kids 3 nights a week for an hour or so. With that time, go work out—it sounds like this weight issue is causing more problems than just physical discomfort for you, it sounds like it’s really hitting your self-esteem hard, as well.

TL;DR: You need to call in reinforcements of SOME kind. I agree that your husband should be coming in earlier and helping around the house more, but sometimes our spouses need to see us make a big, difficult change ourselves, and then they can begin to see the light, and follow along.

Not that you haven’t already been shouldering the burden of so many responsibilities in this relationship already! But sitting down with him and saying, “I’m unhappy, and I’ve identified some of the key reasons why, and here’s my game plan for how to fix it: I’m getting a maid to come clean once a week, and I’m hiring a professional sitter to watch the kids while I go work out three nights a week. I think we’re both unhappy coming home to a filthy house, and I know my self-esteem has tanked since gaining this weight, and I genuinely think that coming home to a bright, clean house and feeling like I still have *some* time to focus on just me, will dramatically improve the energy around here, and even in our relationship.”

Go ahead and find out the pricing of maids and professional sitters in your area, reconcile it with your budget, and lay it out for him so he can see the benefit.

Also, there’s a great chance your husband does in fact love you tremendously still, but he’s feeling so bogged down and sad about where he is in life right now, sex just sounds difficult. Men are emotional creatures, too, and sex is an emotional act. Masturbation is a basic release, but sex requires intimacy and vulnerability. If he’s feeling overweight, in pain, worried that he’s disappointing you, and overwhelmed about his house, his children, and his job, (have you asked him why he stays so late? Maybe he genuinely has a lot on his plate?) sex isn’t going to sound great, despite what we’re told about men basically being animals when it comes to always wanting sex.

Start to contain The Overwhelm, beginning first with things that you can do on your own, (since he’s rejecting the idea of couple’s therapy ATM) and see if the mood and general calm in your house begins to improve.

Obviously, again, this isn’t your fault or your sole responsibility, (I hope I don’t sound like I’m saying this is on you?) but since you’re on your own for right now, take charge where you can, and see what things can change, so you can gradually take steps toward a healthier, happier home environment for you and your family.

**Edit:** OP, check below this comment for a LOT of great recommendations for resources! Lots of Redditors suggested some great ways to get help that sound perfect for you!",2870,107,2019-05-26 06:27:20,bt4rrs
relationships,"29M I want to replace my wedding ring, how do I tell my 29F wife","I just want to say up front that I'm a dumbass and I know it, and this whole situation is my fault, but I do need help. My wife and I were high school sweethearts and got married very young. We went to the same college and got married when we were both 19 year old sophomores. I love her and we definitely made the right decision, and I would do it all over again exactly the same way with no hesitation except for one thing-the ring that I picked.

Now when I was a teen I was definitely a douche. I'm talking affliction tees, hair gel, recreational MMA, macho bs. We picked out our rings together, and of course I wanted my ring to look cool. My wife, who is brilliant and always has been, chose a classy and timeless style for hers, and I did not.

Friends, my ring is large, clunky, mostly black, and has a cringy design on it in silver along with a band of lab created fire opal inlay. I thought it was so badass at the time, and could not understand what my dad was laughing about when he first saw it. Well I sure get it now. 

I've matured a TON in the last ten years and have slowly come to hate it. I am very self conscious of it at my professional office job, and sometimes even take it off if I have important meetings with clients. I feel horribly guilty every time. 

I've gently broached the topic of maybe getting a ring that looks more professional, but my wife has pushed back, saying that we picked our rings together and have had them for ten years and that's really special to her. I absolutely do not want to hurt her feelings. How can I approach this in a way that would make it easier for her to accept, short of doing a full-on vow renewal with new rings (suggested by my best friend; is the nuclear option due to cost)?

TLDR: I was an idiot teenager when I got married, picked out an Ed Hardy level wedding ring, need to replace it without hurting my wife's feelings.

Edit: Thank you all for the great advice! I have a lot to consider, but I have a lot of new ideas now. I don't want to post a pic of my ring because I don't want to be able to be identified from this post, but you can find pics of similar rings by googling the descriptors I used, like some people in the comments have pointed out. ","Can you tell her that you really want to replace your ring with something more adult and professional, and that your current one isn’t a good reflection of that. and want to put your previous ring in a shadow box on your bedside table, or frame it? Just tell her it’s purely about the aesthetics and you want something to match a more mature style ",2836,283,2019-01-20 02:51:18,ahtgdj
relationships,Friend [37/F] is about to be turned-down for a promotion she has dreamed of for years. I [36/F] know it's coming and don't know how to support her or what to do.,"Sorry, never posted here before and didn't know I needed a tl;dr (it is at the bottom). Reposting.

&#x200B;

I  used to work on a small team for a division of a multinational company.  We used to primarily be staffed by what were called “old timers”  basically people who were close to being of a pensionable age who didn’t  want the hustle. That culture shifted and a lot of young blood has been  brought in. I formerly worked there and was given a lateral move out. A  colleague “Tina” still works there. Recently an opening for Director  came up and Tina came to me for help. She's been doing overtime and working hard to get noticed for this position. She's well qualified for it and has extensive experience at the company, so she was given a chance to interview for it.

Tina  is a single mother who has overcome poverty in childhood,  racists/bigots in the industry and worked hard to support her kids.  She’s had health issues but always fought hard. Tina is tenacious and  hardworking, but there are issues – she struggles in some areas and  while she’d definitely make a great director as she’s contentious, kind  and courteous, the role is evolving and may be a bit of a stretch.  Nonetheless, I helped her with her application and presentation. Beyond being colleagues, she and  I are friends; we spend a lot of time outside of work together (we’re  the only women of color in our respective areas) and share a lot of our  deep feelings and thoughts. She worked hard and put together a good  presentation. I was really proud of her. She presented this morning at  9:30 and got through it and was out by 10:00.

Most  of the other applicants were internal and interviewed yesterday but one  person was recommended by a senior VP in a different department. The  guy who was recommended is a 30-year-old hot-shot (I think he may actually be in his late twenties). He will soon graduate  from an Ivy League MBA and is the definition of corporate style. They  gave him a last-minute presentation slot immediately following Tina. I  attended all of the presentations (I am not on the hiring committee) but  was there to support Tina and see how the presentations went.

When  the hotshot gave his presentation, it wasn’t even close. The 20 of us  sat in the room and were dumbfounded. Not only was his presentation  visually appealing but he noticed details none of us ever did and he  developed a pitch that was so innovative that our AVP asked to use a tag  line he created. His technical analysis was so spot-on that it was  spooky. He understood issues facing our business unit without having to  be told and had ready solutions to solve the problems. Questions they  asked him were more about how he’ll do things *when*  he takes over the role. It was made very clear to him that this was his  job and they even provided an unofficial tentative start date. It is  very clear that he understands the industry and his past experiences,  such as professional work experience as well as winning top case  competitions and academic awards prepared him very well. The  presentations were in totally different leagues.

After  he finished, he made a self-deprecating joke and took questions. He  thanked us and left. We all sat there for a minute chatting when the AVP  very loudly told the HR director to offer significantly above the  salary and hammer-out a start date immediately and get a contract  signed. The VP who recommended him knew him from the MBA program as the  VP is a case coach there. He said he’d be his reference and they are  skipping all the formalities and going right to the offer.

Tina has no idea. She was so happy with her performance and she's *sure*  she nailed it. She did well, about as well as the other candidates, but  this guy is out-and-out in a different league. Just based on that I too  would hire the other guy. She's sitting on cloud 9 at her desk and  planning a celebratory dinner to celebrate her performance (she was told  decisions would be made in a couple of weeks). At this rate, it's  likely she'll be informed that she didn't get the job well before 5 PM.

&#x200B;

I  really don't know what to do or say. If she asks, should I be honest  about this guy's presentation? Should I avoid her the rest of the day? I  want to support her, but have no idea how to even begin talking to her.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

tl;dr Friend applied for a job she has worked towards for two years. She got proverbially destroyed in the interview but has no idea another candidate is going to get it. She's planning to celebrate tonight about her performance in the interview but will probably find out long before that she lost out. How can I support her?","I wouldn't tell her that she isn't getting the job, but I would give her a heads up that someone else had a really strong presentation, to the point where you aren't sure what they're going to do.  At least that way she'll be a little more emotionally prepared when the news comes.",2841,71,2019-03-22 16:54:39,b47frm
relationships,[Update] My (20F) sister (13F) has been experiencing something Seriously scary and I don't know what to do,"Let me begin by apologizing for not interacting individually with everyone that responded to my previous post, exam time's been keeping me upto my neck in books.

Thank you for your help. I'm so grateful. I talked to my sister again yesterday and explained to her that may be a stress generated problem or the possibility of her being ill for which she might need to see a psychiatrist. 

It's because she requested in the first place that I do not inform our parents that I agreed to it. However, I explained to her that if she needs further treatment we will need to tell them, and she has agreed bc I spent a considerable amount of time explaining that I did not, infact, think that she was a lunatic, and that mental illnesses need to be addressed the same way physical illnesses are, and that I just want her to get better, the same way she does. I talked about the same with my brother, who concurs.

She has agreed but only after first seeing a psychologist employed by her school (she went to the counselor that day and was advised to do so), whom she will be seeing today. Hopefully things will get better and I'll try my best to help explain her condition to our parents to keep them from doubting her. Truthfully, I could not have had this talk or reasoned through this situation without all of you. I am extremely thankful. 🙇🏾‍♀️🙇🏾‍♀️

Tl;dr My sister agreed to seeing a psychiatrist conditional on recommendation of a psychologist, thank you for your help

So you guys gave me some advice and I took it. I found her on Instagram through some miracle, and I requested to follow her, which she accepted. It’s not much of an update, but she is interesting! She dyes her hair pink and blue. I don’t know what she’s actually like, to be honest. Is she nice? Is she nasty? I couldn’t ever tell.

I can’t find my brother. I don’t know how to spell his name.

I feel guilty. I’ll admit, a big reason why I found her is because I feel guilty. I get to have my dad. All the Father’s Days go to me, she gets nothing. He left her when she was 1. 

Is it bad to say I resent him for it? I’ll bet she does. I love him, but honestly? He doesn’t deserve a Father’s Day. He abandoned his role as a dad to two people.

You don’t get to dish out your love accordingly. You don’t get to pick and choose which children you’ll love and which ones you’ll forget. Yes, you’re with my mum NOW, but that doesn’t make me more of a daughter than her. But you were more of a dad to me than you were to those two combined. Do you think seeing them once a year is gonna compensate? A lonely card on their birthday with some money in?

Whatever, I might try to strike up a conversation with her soon but we’ll see. 

**TL;DR - I found my sister on Instagram and I’m starting to resent my dad for leaving her.**","My story is very similar to yours, only I would be the forgotten sister in this situation. I think it's sweet that you are empathizing with your siblings situation. My dad straight up deleted me out of his life once he found a new family when I was about 7 years old. He never talked to me again after that. I have a lot of emotional damage from the situation, but my life turned out good regardless. I think it would be nice of you to reach out to your sister. It's ok to love your dad, because he was good to you, while also losing some respect for him not contacting his other kids. Adults aren't perfect and sometimes they make wrong choices. But we can still love them regardless. Good luck.",2734,51,2019-07-06 12:42:27,c9t6ne
relationships,"Me (25M) and best friend (28F) recently slept together, now causing huge issues and tension, no clue what to do","Repost as removed as broke a rule in error - apologies!

Throwaway for obvious reasons. First things first this may be long and windy, I hope it all makes sense but I think just typing it out and getting it off my chest will help massively anyway. I need some advice on what I can do here and where I go - i need to keep my friend.

&#x200B;

I met her two years ago when we worked together and quickly became very close. She helped me through the darkest times of my life (i was mid split with an abusive ex when we met), and I helped her through some really tough and unimaginable things. There were lots of rumours at the time we were seeing each other and everyone assumed we were an item, but for the past two years our relationship has been purely platonic - she is (was?) my best friend and up until a few weeks back I don't think we'd even ever hugged.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to a week ago - she came over for dinner and wine, this is very common and normal. We had more than usual and she was over the limit so couldn't drive, so she stayed the night. We slept in the same bed but apart and no physical contact again, it was completely normal and just as expected. We somehow didn't get up and ended up staying in bed until 10pm the next day just talking. Sometime during that evening she got upset about something going on in her life, I rubbed her back while telling her everything will be ok and then we just cuddled - probably the first bit of real physical contact between us but nothing was sexual, didn't feel weird and she went home and it was all OK.

&#x200B;

This last weekend we had a hiking holiday planned, where we'd be sleeping in her van (she has a converted transit). It's one bed but we thought we'd be fine. First night it was freezing, ending up cuddling and spooning but again didn't feel sexual. Second night is where it all went a bit wrong, we drank a bit too much and the spoon ended up getting carried away - it seems to be a joint thing and before I knew it we were kissing and touching each other everywhere. It was a bit of a frenzy of this for about 15 minutes until we both stopped and realised what we just did. After this we spoke a little and asked if either of us regretted it, we both said we didn't but it was odd. She got upset and I told her it was ok - it didn't change anything and we could just draw a line under it. We woke up the next morning and it happened again, we didn't talk too much but then went for a walk and then just before we headed home we ended up all over each other again, we were completely naked but again stopped, cuddled and lay there. We both agreed it was a ""what happens in X, stays in X"" type event.

&#x200B;

It was a really long trip home (6 hours+), during this she would rest her head on my, hand on lap ect and it seemed very different to our usual dynamic. When we stopped at services for breaks we seemed to walk arm in arm, we kept kissing on and off but it seems strangely normal? We arrived back at her home, she lives with her dad at the moment but just before I left she kissed me again and thanked me for a wonderful weekend.

&#x200B;

The following day (two days ago) she came over to get some stuff I took home with me, we end up just cuddling, kissing, feeling and so on again. We are on my bed and dry humping but she has dinner with a friend and we stop it there, she goes on her way. Two days later she comes over for a film and food - we had a lovely night, she ends up staying and we end up having sex twice. This should feel really weird and strange, but it felt completely normal and we both discussed it that it was so odd it felt normal.

&#x200B;

Yesterday she turned up unannounced at my place (which is not a normal thing) with coffee and doughnuts, we end up talking, cuddling, kissing again and then we end up talking about what this is - que the big problem. Neither of us were sure, she got panicky and burst out in tears and left. She said she was really scared and her words were ""I think I will end up pushing you away and hurting you and I don't want to do that to you"". I told her I would come and see her later and talk. I drove to her house but her ex was there, another slight issue. They broke up 6 years ago stayed close friends, he is a lovely bloke but in his head he is certain they will get married and have children. She's had the conversation with him but he seems to shut it off. If he found out she was seeing anyone he would get extremely angry, but there's so much family history intertwined between the both it's really complicated. For that reason she has avoided seeing anyone in the past 6 years. The reason he turned up is she hadn't responded to him since the night we kissed. I went home when I saw his car and just said she could come to mine to chat later.

&#x200B;

She turned up, sad and very emotional. She explained she ran off because she is terrified of losing our friendship, I said let's just cut the romance out, draw a line under it and be friends again but she seemed to not speak much when I said this. I asked if her ex was the issue - she said it was nothing to do with us but a whole other issue, but that was not impacting what was going on between us. We sat quietly, hugged and I tried to reassure it would be OK, and I wasn't going to start hating her for whatever reason, and I am completely fine with just being platonic friends again. We both agree and say whatever happens we stay friends and nobody gets hurt but we will pull back from the more physical side. This somehow ends up with us kissing? We kiss for a little while and I tell her she should probably go home and get some rest, but everything is ok. We get up and she helps make my bed, I give her a hug and open my bedroom door so she can leave, she then takes the door off me, closes it and kisses me - this then leads to sex and we have really passionate sex for about an hour. We get up, cuddle, kiss and she leaves.

&#x200B;

I woke up this morning really panicky, I have no idea where we are, where we stand and absolutely terrified of losing our friendship. I don't know what to do or say. I've felt sick to my stomach and can't eat at the thought of this. She is coming around later to collect some of her clothes she left last night and I am thinking I need a plan of what to say/do.I cannot lose my best friend - she is absolutely everything to me but I am worried we crossed a line and there's only one eventual outcome which won't be good.

&#x200B;

I'm super sorry if this is hard to read, but man it felt like a weight off my shoulders just typing this out. If there's a more appropriate sub for this I can post there instead

TLDR; slept with my absolute best friend of 2 years, both now having serious panic issues and overthinking with not knowing what to do. I don't know what I want and I think she is confused too - what on earth can we do to try and protect either of us from getting hurt???","I think you go for it. 

It sounds like you’ve set the foundation for a great relationship. Stop calling it “odd” and be truthful that it’s what you want. 

Tell her she is “absolutely everything” like you wrote here. Then ask what she wants to do. It’s been six years since that ex. It’s over.",2707,298,2019-06-28 10:52:57,c6irbo
relationships,My fiancé (33M) only touches me (33F) for 5-10 minutes everyday,"I’ve been with my fiancé for 3 years and plan to get married next year. We love each other and are committed to building a life and home together.

But I crave intimacy and physical contact. I find myself crying to sleep most nights.

We used to have sex multiple times a week, but now we have sex once a week at most. And if we do have sex, I have to initiate it. I will always initiate foreplay and will almost always give him oral sex. It is rare that he returns the favor. Almost every time, the foreplay is abruptly ended when he tells me, “just get on top”— so he can finish. Sex ends when he finishes. We only have sex when I’m on top because it’s the most pleasurable for him. Sex with him is not intimate. He lays on his back with his eyes closed. There is no touching outside of the penetration. I have to force his hands on my breasts. Sex is sterile and feels transactional. As soon as he’s done, he goes to sleep. I have never orgasmed. On the most frustrated nights, I force his hands towards my vagina so I can finish as well. 

When we first started dating, he used to masturbate in bed while I would be next to him. He would masturbate before attempting to initiate sex with me. This erupted in a big fight and he no longer does this. Now I can’t help but feel like I’ve just replaced his hand. 

A few weeks ago, we went camping and he couldn’t sleep. He asked to have sex so he can orgasm and sleep. That was obviously not the most romantic way to go about initiating sex. I’ve never felt so used in my life.

After work every night when we are home, we will kiss each other sporadically throughout the night. His kisses are just little pecks on the lips when we’re watching tv. I barely feel his lips. I have to pull him towards me to ask for a real passionate kiss. I ask to cuddle or hug or embrace but he says it’s not comfortable for him to do so on the couch.

Every night, we’ll be on the couch (not touching, with a body of space between us)  and then he will take a hit of marijuana and all of sudden will say he’s going to bed. He’ll crawl into bed as I get ready for bed. When I’m ready to sleep and get into bed, he’s already sleeping and I have to strain myself to reach over to kiss him on the lips goodnight.

As we are in bed, his back is towards me. It is hard for me to fall asleep without warmth or some physical touch. I find myself grasping at a pillow and putting a pillow on my back to mimic that physical human comfort. Again, I will cry myself to sleep or go on my phone until I’m tired. At this point, he is fast asleep.

He wakes up before me and I feel that he is. Every day I feel a little hope that he will grab to cuddle me. But every day he will only cuddle when he knows I’m half awake and will do so for about 5-10 minutes before jumping up to sit on the couch, go on his phone, watch espn and walk the dog. I hear these activities every morning as I lay in bed awake, with my pillows again near me for physical comfort.

On weekend nights, I get the most sexual energy from him, but that is after him getting high all day. Again the sex feels very one sided, but at least he will tell me  he wants sex. The night on a sex night will end with him rolled over and again without me feeling recognized.

I have tried talking to him on several occasions but it usually ends up with him yelling at me saying it’s all not true and “we do cuddle!!!” With all the yelling and the lack of change, am I doomed for a marriage with zero intimacy?

TL;DR - My love language is physical touch and I’m not feeling loved.  


—-

Edit: A commenter asked if he shows his love in other ways. Yes, he will buy me flowers and say I love you multiple times a day. Every morning when he gets to work he sends me a kissing emoji. He will wash the dishes and has made dinner. His love language is definitely acts of service. 

We can have intimate, emotional, spiritual, and intellectual conversations. There are so many reasons why I love him and want to have a future with him. We respect each other as partners. We are good at communication and have managed to talk through our issues as they come up but on this particular topic of sex and physical contact is where it’s been the most difficult.",I’d rather be alone than feeling lonely in a relationship.,2699,299,2019-07-31 11:58:34,ck7iyh
relationships,"My partner [28/M] of 7 years, deleted me [26/F] from various Instagram posts in order to continue to receive attention from someone else","

Hello my friends near and far, I have never really used this before, so I apologize immensely for being unaware of certain posting criteria! I hope you are all doing well, and I thank you for taking the time to read this post!


I have been with my partner for 7 years, we initially met online, and after meeting in person a few times, and realizing our affection for one another, we found it promising to move in together. I moved from California to Pennsylvania to be with him throughout graduate school. All was seemingly well during this time. I have never really had any reason to not trust him. I encouraged him to very much so, to try his best to make friends, or to explore hobbies on his own outside of the various ones we share, because I have my own passions, and I found we connected most when we met in the middle through conversations about these passions, through the act of explaining or showcasing what we've taken in or learned. 


Throughout these 7 years, he has struggled with very low self esteem, and though I don't necessarily think of myself as the pillar of self love, the depth of mine doesn't reach the low perception of his self value. Because of this, he has seen and stopped seeing, both a counselor, and a therapist, and has been on medication to help for the last 6 months.


Things where seemingly well between us, and continued to be pretty fluid. We continued to share things, and take long walks, and where pretty open ended about where we stood in the relationship, if one was feeling a bit of an ebb, the other would pick up more of a share, and vice versa. 


However, things took a bit of a dip about 2 days ago, when I felt the ebb, and asked him about it. Initially, he said there was really nothing wrong, and perhaps I was just feeling this way because with our schedules we haven't been able to see one another for long periods of time like we are used to, which is true. But the feeling continued to irk me, and when I asked about it a second time, he confessed to me, he had begun talking to another girl from another country, via Instagram direct messages, and though things between she and him never crossed the boundaries of platonic friendship, he really loved the initial rush of someone asking him questions about his favorite movie, his favorite album, his favorite book, all things he and I already know very well about one another. I asked if he'd sent any selfies, or anything, risqué, and he said no, though I can't confirm, because he deleted the messages, a good deal of me believes him, because of how open he was about the initial conversations to begin with. We slept apart, and I just felt really confused the entire night, because I couldn't really resonate with wanting that sort of attention from someone else. If anything, his yearning for that type of attention, sort of hurt. It felt like I wasn't doing enough, or giving enough.


The next morning, though I don't have an Instagram, and am not on the app, I went to check his using the desktop version, and found that posts where he once called me 'the love of his life' or a specific post with a gift I gave him that once said 'greatest gift from the greatest girl' where still on his profile, but the words, 'girlfriend' or 'love of my life' where completed erased. With this realization, my confusion and hurt turned to very real heartache. I called him and asked if he had deleted these words from the specific posts, and with shame, he said yes he did. When I asked why, he said it was because he just didn't want the attention from the girl asking him about himself to be disrupted if she found out he was in a long term relationship. I guess this is where, I asked the obvious and questioned why someone who is just asking about your favorite books, movies, etc, would be driven away by the fact that you have a girlfriend. And he said he didn't know why he did it, and that it was a massive mistake.


At the risk of seeming toxic, and I will take full accountability for seeming so or being so, I asked him to please deactivate his Instagram for the time being while we sort through this, his twitter as well. He did, and though I was feeling a bit of relief about that, I couldn't help but feel a bit saddened that he didn't choose to do that on his own for the benefit of our relationship, he had to wait for me to ask. Which again, just made me feel like such a toxic and controlling partner. Two things I always strive to be so far from.


When he got home from work, we discussed everything at massive length, and he continued to swear up and down, that these conversations pertained strictly to music, movies, and books, and he didn't have interest in her, just interest in the initial rush of the attention he was receiving. We read a few articles, and he broke things down to me as his self esteem has never been lower, despite his career as a doctor being at a high, and his finances in order, he felt things with his music weren't taking off, and with that came a feeling that he wasn't special, and it was nice for someone to make him feel that way. I felt shame and asked him if I wasn't doing enough or giving enough to him to make him feel that way, he said, I defiantly was, but my love, and attention and affection, became a pillar he could rely on, and got used to, so with new attention came a rush, and he liked that. 


I asked him if he wanted to be single, and find that rush in dating new people, and he kept insisting that that's so far from what he wants. He wants to remain a couple, and do all he can to work on these things together. Though I can't help but correlate that feeling he enjoys with the feeling of a first date. Which hurts of course. I told him I didn't really see how we could move past this because there was nothing much for me to make an attempt to work on moving forward. This seems to be a self stemming problem, that I emphasize with, but just don't want to be on the receiving end of the counter effects. 


So though it is incredibly uneasy to begin to think of how difficult it'll be to begin again, it is just as difficult to think about how difficult it would be to stay and try to rebuild back up an issue that I feel like just a bystander when it comes to. 


This has all been very painful and if this comes to an end I just want it to be as civil and as possible. He deserves to love himself, but not at the expense of the love we have between us. I deserve love that is stable and comforting, and not laced with newfound paranoia. 


Despite this all, my heart is still very much in this of course, and he has been very vocal about how it was just one mistake, nothing happened, we can work through this, etc. And I secretly keep hoping he will make a step, any step really, to showcase these words and implement action, seek a new therapist, find the two of us a relationship counselor, buy a book on self help or on how couple conquer affairs, anything, anything at all, without me having to be the one to ask him. I just want him to have that yearning that he continues to say he has, but instead of saying it, I was him to show me. 


Do you think that makes me irrational or just plain dumb? I believe to be in a state where I can handle either answer. Or something completely different just the same!


Do you all think I'm blowing something completely out of proportion? Given how this was an exchange of conversation between him and another girl for just a few days, and his erasure of me on his profile was only for about 2 days? 


Alas, we have come to the very end of this post, if you've made it, I can not thank you enough for giving me your time, if you take the time to post, I can not thank you enough for giving me your efforts. This has been a first in this relationship, this has been a first in my life truthfully, and throughout writing this I just felt completely vulnerable and isolated. So, if you've given me your time, thank you, thank you, thank you! I hope what happened to me, doesn't happen to you, and wish you all things gracious and good and completely fulfilling my friends! Best of luck, and all of my love and gratitude.


TL;DR I've been in a relationship for 7 years, my partner recently and unexpectedly kept posts on Instagram that showcased us as a couple but deleted the words beneath them that included the words 'love of my life' and 'girlfriend' in order to continue to receive attention from another girl who lives in another country, who he says he shared a platonic relationship with via Instagram direct messages, and really only enjoyed the aspects of her asking him questions about his favorite things and giving him validation. He says he only erased those specific words in order to keep the flow of validation coming. He doesn't want to end things or see other people, I am a bit unsure about where to go or what to do.","I dunno man. He erased your relationship to keep someone else interested and get external validation. He has a lot to work through self esteem wise. You want him to take charge about the future of your relationship but you’re tired of being the one to push him into it. It sounds like you already put in a lot more effort I this relationship: moves to another state, build up his self esteem, noticed their was a decline.

If he doesn’t take charge, would u leave?",2692,178,2019-04-27 15:24:45,bi050t
relationships,I [29m] feel like I should break up with my girlfriend [28f] because of lack of sexual chemistry. How can I prevent shredding her self-esteem?,"Tldr: I need to tell my girlfriend that the sexual chemistry between us does not work. How do I tell her without completely destroying her self-esteem? Need advice!

So my girlfriend and I have been together for about two years. We have a great emotional and mental bond and get along wonderfully. I realized that for me, the sexual chemistry was really low from the beginning. I thought we could work on that and that it would come with time. Unfortunately it did not and it breaks my heart... We have sex somewhat regularly but usually I'd rather just cuddle and watch a movie or do something else with her. Even things I loved doing with previous partner rather turns me off with her. I can't even go down on her because the taste is irritating and that was something I loved to do.

As hard as it is, I feel like she deserves someone who's as much into her as she is into me. I don't want to end up in a long term relationship where both of us are unsatisfied with our sex life, even if all other domains are well. I feel like I can't give her what she wants and needs.

The thought of breaking up will probably already hurt her very much. She's planning a future with me and talks constantly about moving in together, starting a family etc. I'm afraid that telling her that the sexual chemistry does not work for me will shred her self-esteem and I really want to prevent this. I think my girlfriend is wonderful and beautiful but it somehow doesn't work for me sexually. I had flings with girls which were way below here judging by the looks with which the chemistry was not an issue. So how can I explain this to my girlfriend without completely devastating her? I really hope for some advice!

Edit: Holy... This blew up way more than I thought. I will try to answer as many questions as possible.  
So, some clarifications: I am not 100% sure yet if a break-up is the way to go. If it is, I have not accepted it yet just now. I will therefore talk to some people in my support net and try to get some time to think on my own.   
People thinking I have not tried working on this: I did. She realised that I am reluctant to sex sometimes. We tried to spice things up with toys, different places, etc. I cut down on self-enjoyment. Hell I am open to seeing a therapist. However, I am not sure if any of these things can affect the sexual chemistry.   
Anyway, I will try to make up my mind as soon as possible and let her know as soon as this happend.   
Thank you all for your advice! It is really appreciated.","As someone who has been dumped for a reason like yours, and being an emotional guy : yeah, it will hurt like hell. My self-esteem went to rock bottom. And it still hurt a bit one year after, but it's way way better than before.

But be understanding, be there, let her cry, let her be angry, and the most important thing : let her go entirely. Don't try to be friends, don't try to stay in touch, do NOT confort her, don't manipulate her.

Just rip the band aid off and one day, she'll be okay, and with someone compatible with her, as you will. :)",2676,128,2019-08-16 12:11:47,cr5i0j
relationships,I (31M) was just told by my partner (29F) that she wants to stop working fulltime.,"First let me start off by saying my partner has been through a lot. We had been dating for 2 years and planning a life together when she was disagnosed with cancer. At the time she was in school for a dual graduate degree program and managed to finish it. Treatment was rough on her and she strugled a lot through it, and hasn't done well mentally dealing with the unfairness of it all, how different her body is after surgeries, and the fear of it coming back. All perfectly understandable, and I've been as supportive as I can throughout it all.

Now all that said, she went into the graduate programs after we started dating and one of the degrees was at a very expensive school for something that was only related and not required for the work she planned on doing which would never pay very well. I questioned her about it gently at the time but she was adamant about getting the expensive degree. It was her life, and we agreed it would be fine because we could utilize public service loan forgiveness to pay off her debt that would total \~$100k. This was before cancer.

I earn a considerable amount more than her, when we started dating I made \~4x and even with her degrees I make \~3x what she does. I've always been happy to spend money on her, and after having moved in together over a year ago and proposing shortly after I really went into the mindset of it being ""our"" money. When we moved in she was finishing her degrees and I covered 100% of our bills, including some tuition costs for an extra semester since she was slightly delayed by her treatment. This was totally fine because school was her job and she'd be able to contribute when she graduated and even though I make much more if we are both working full time jobs it felt fair.

Now that she has graduated and started working, she is miserable at her job mostly because she is incredibly anxious that she isn't doing it well and doesn't feel like her school prepared her. She was already prone towards anxiety and depression (she takes medicine for it) but mentally she is in a very bad spot because of all this. On top of that she feels like she doesn't doing enough for her health (mostly exercise) to keep her healthy to reduce the cancer from coming back but she says she is too tired after work to do much else than occationally go on a walk.

Recently she got the idea in her head to start working half weeks to give her more time to exercise, and stress her out about work less. She says not knowing for sure how long she'll live has changed her priorities about working. Before all this she was a pretty driven type a personality working multiple jobs. But working part time doesn't meet the requirements for public service loan forgiveness.

We've talked about it extensively and she feels it is important for her to work part time, but I am not very comfortable with the idea for many reasons. I get where she is coming from in her needs but feel like she is looking for a quick fix to her problems that puts us in a pretty big hole financially because she is so miserable instead of fully dealing with her problems. I'd be more ok with it if it was short term while she sorted through some things but she says she just wants more time to exercise and be stress free so she doesn't know when that would end.

I just feel like she is taking our relationship which is already unbalanced and asking to make it a lot more so--and soley because she is in a position to do so because of my job. We can financially afford it but I haven't been able to come to terms about the disproportionality it would create in our relationship.

I am just looking for some advice on maybe a better way to think about this that would maybe make me feel more comfortable with it, some opinions on if I'm just being a greedy/selfish asshole, and some comiseration if anyone has been in a similar situation.

I probably left out a lot so feel free to ask questions, this post is already very long, and if you read it all thanks for sticking with me! I obviously shared my side but I tried to not be too uneven since I think she has legitimate points but it hasn't changed my uneasiness with it.

**tl;dr** My long time partner wants to start working half time to relieve her work stress and give her more time to take care of her health but it makes me uncomfortable because she has $100k of debt and it would make our relationship very unbalanced.","I can see both sides; no, you shouldn't shoulder the majority of the financial burden, and I get why you're apprehensive about something that could delay her PSLF eligibility. But also, she just went through something traumatic, and it's not uncommon for people to take some time to process that trauma and to figure out how to move on. She doesn't want to completely stop working; she just can't manage her stress while working full hours.

There's probably a middle ground here you two can figure out, but it's going to require a lot of communication about how this is going to happen, for how long, what alternatives are available for the parts you or your GF don't want to do, etc. For example, is it possible for her to go on short term disability while she works on her anxiety and depression? It would pay more than part-time, and it's going to have a timeline that forces you two to reassess in a couple months or so, once the time has run out. Or, can she agree to only doing it for a year, for now, and going to therapy throughout so that she makes sure she's getting the best help she can find for managing her stress? Or, can you two agree that she can go part time indefinitely, so long as you don't have to handle more financially than you already handle? Etc. A couples counselor could also help mediate you guys through a discussion to help you two reach the best decision for you. 

But bottom line is that both of you have valid concerns, so you two just have to keep trying to figure out a solution that adequately addresses both of your concerns.",2661,162,2019-10-02 12:07:53,dc9a58
relationships,UPDATE - My Dad moved in with his girlfriend... I am struggling.,"Here is my original post just if you wanted further background. [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/dqrr7d/my\_dad\_is\_moving\_in\_with\_his\_long\_term\_girlfriend/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/dqrr7d/my_dad_is_moving_in_with_his_long_term_girlfriend/)

**TLDR - I have visited my Dad and his girlfriends new house, twice for a few days each time. I have felt very strange in the new situation and dynamics but they have all been very welcoming to me. Any advice on how to get pass these worries would be great. All points of views are welcome regardless of what role you play in your blended family experience (past, present or future.)**

Hello everyone, I'm Mason and I am a 14 year old boy! I just wanted to update you all on the progression of my new situation since my original post. You were all so great with the advice that I really wanted to do this.

So I took the advice that one or two of you gave me and decided to ask my parents if I could split my days shorter when visiting for the first time just in case I found it overwhelming. They both agreed and didn't make me feel awkward about the suggestion at all. I have completed my first set of visits and went back a second time.

My Dad introduced me to my new bedroom which was a decent size. He gave me a budget and then took me out to get loads of bedroom related stuff. I really enjoyed it and it was nice to have some ownership over my new space. My Dads girlfriend cooked a pasta meal that I thoroughly enjoyed and we all had a movie night. My first night in my room felt a bit odd and I had a restless night but that soon improved. Me and her son got on well enough as usual and we had a laugh during the movie night.

By the second day it still felt strange. I wanted to go back home at it was so unusual to be in the house. The realisation hit me that this would now be a regular thing. They are both very loved up and affectionate I don't really understand that feeling of weirdness about it as he has moved out a while ago and I have seen them together many times. I guess I will work through it the best I can. My Dad and her son get on really well which gave me a pang of jealousy but I really tried not to show it as I believe I am the one with the issue and not them. My Dad had given me one on one time so there was no really reason to get envious.

Overall I am happy for them but I did genuinely try and any insecurities or worries I had, I put to one side and planned to wait and see how the second visit was... By the second visit I currently do feel a bit like a guest (a well treated guest) at a residence. They have a solid dynamic that I am trying to find my place in and all have in jokes that I don't really understand. I never noticed this before but I realised that they all get on extremely well and have obviously spent a lot of time together in the past. I am trying to fit into their routine and ways of doing things and I realised his girlfriends routine seems dominantly the way things are done in the house meaning she and her son get by more easily if that makes sense. I feel I need to be on my best behaviour at all times and am constantly not wanting to offend intentionally. I have a feeling my Dad stayed at their old place rather a lot and this is why they get on so well on a day to day basis. This made the green eyed monster come out. Pretty sure this is fairly normal but Reddit helps me to chill out a bit as well as the suggested writing it down on paper. I have a lot to work through and I have decided to try and be more self reliant now that I am getting older (slightly sad but cool to.) I know they will listen to my concerns if I am worried. Another piece of good advice I got on here. I have no idea why I am not level headed on certain things anymore, the emotions just pour out via my mind and then settles down.

Any advice, suggestions or your own experience of this would be appreciated. Please give it to me straight, I don't need mollycoddling...

EDIT (27/11/19) - I AM EXTREMELY TAKEN BACK BY ALL THE WONDERFUL AND SUPPORTIVE MESSAGES YOU GUYS AND GALS HAVE POSTED...

I am sorry I have not responded yet but I have been so busy trying to take my mind off of this situation that I have barely has time to post on here. I promise I will reply soon. School journeys have been hard but are becoming more common if not demotivating. I still feel like a relative visiting. I have done chores as suggested but feel I have to do regular and daily chores so that I earn my place in the house, which I suppose is true to a degree. I still feel conflicted at seeing them together and know I need to keep trying but I just want to go back home to familiar surroundings when I am at my Dads new home.","I just think you sound incredibly emotionally mature, and I think it’s wonderful how you are taking ownership of your discomfort. 

Just wanted to encourage you! Things will feel better as time goes on. It seems like you’re already doing the ‘right’ things.",2619,84,2019-11-21 20:35:10,dzph55
relationships,SO[35M]'s parents [65?M/F] doesn't like me[31F] because I'm not like his son.,"My situation is really weird. 

**Explanation:** I'm what the deaf (non-verbal audio) classify as Hard hearing (HH) because I can communicate with hearing person without resorting sign languages or notes. 

I met my boyfriend, ""Alan"", who is deaf about year ago. I was the only person he could communicate at work with ASL, even though I only could sign basic words. Later, he began to teach me in more advanced ASL and we found out we have so much in common in tv, movies, books tastes with similar goals and desires in life that we became best friends that evolved into a romantic relationship. We're going strong nine months now and we're compatible in every area. It's the best and healthiest relationship I ever had and I'm always excited and giddy to see him at work or when we wake up together. He feels the same and we're talking moving each other as soon his lease is up in three months from now.  

Two months ago, we decided to meet each other parents which all are hearing (he's their only deaf son). Alan met mine and it went fabulous. Then we met his parents, ""Irma"" and ""Paul"". 

I thought we got along because they were smiling, gushing and laughing but I'm beginning to believe they were putting their best masks for the sake of their son. One time on a family's bday parties, Irma said in front of the ladies with me next to her, ""It's so impressive you can talk with that speech impediment. I barely can understand you myself."" She said as jokingly manner but no one laughed, everyone glanced at each other awkwardly and I just stared at her, then excused myself. At first I wasn't sure if she meant as generational-ignorant way like ""who's the woman in the relationship?"" to the gays. I didn't mention to my boyfriend because I was hoping it was only time remark.

It wasn't. They made more comments, mostly Irma, about me struggling pronunciation or grammars, using sign language incorrectly and not teaching me the right one like Alan would do, or not having deaf/HH friends or not going more to deaf community and so on. It happened so gradual and subtle that I didn't realize they were being insulting to my face that to this day I still wonder. Most of the time they would make those comments without Alan nearby. I mentioned to Alan few times and he told me that maybe they were worried I might not understand the deaf culture. He talked to them that saying those things weren't helpful and he would appreciate if they would shut it up. They didn't.  

Few weeks ago at bbq party, Irma and Paul sort of insinuated about my parent for not giving best tool for me, saying it was a shame that my parent didn't put me in deaf school or letting me to get cochlea implant or letting me to study aboard in non-deaf university program. They made it sound as if my parent crippled me as person because my social and emotional network didn't consist the ""right"" people. This time I got angry and I said what they said was rude, that my parents made lot sacrifice for me and no one has the right to belittle for their choices about raising me. Alan caught at the end of the conversation (lipreading) and asked me what's going on. Not so surprisingly, Alan's parent threw me under the bus, remarking I was so sensitive after making such innocuous comment. Alan saw I was uncomfortable and asked me if I want to leave. I said yes and we left, when we got home he asked me what they said to me. I didn't want to say what his parent told me because it was so ugly to talk about it but I told him anyway and he got upset for me. He face-timed them and said they shouldn't said that. He told them they crossed the line. They pretended they didn't know what I was talking about, that perhaps I misunderstood, considering I'm ""hard hearing"" which upset Alan even more. They ended arguing for few minute before Alan hung up. 

Since then, Alan has become desolate and needy. He apologized to me hundred of times for not believing me what I said before. I told them that he has nothing to apologize because I wasn't sure if they were being snide toward me until now and I'm not going to blame Alan for what his parent said to me. He told me he's thinking reducing contact with them but I told Alan it wasn't necessary. He can do whatever he wants with his parent but that I rather would not go to any of his family gathering or go his parent's. He assured he would never force me or put me in that situation ever again. 

We're closer together than we were but he's still sad and he no longer goes to his family gatherings or his parent's. I find him staring at nothing in particular for long minutes and his eyes which used to sparkle are now dim. I want to cheer him up but I'm not so sure how to in first place. I just don't know what to do and I don't understand why his parents are so rude toward me because I'm not ""completely"" deaf considering they aren't one!

What I can do? 

**TL;DR** : My SO's parent (hearing) doesn't like me because I'm (Hard Hearing) not completely deaf like he is. SO found out and he's upset. ","He's 35 and his family has essentially kept him isolated with the kind of passive aggressive tactics they used on you.  It's entirely natural that he would mourn their ability to be happy for him.

Let him work on the changing the dynamic with his family as he goes.  He shouldn't cut them out completely, just withdraw a bit.   If he wants to attend a family event, discuss it and decide what's best in the specific situation.

You are probably the best thing that ever happened to him too.  Keep that in mind as you deal with his parents and extended family.",2609,51,2019-03-30 19:31:52,b7f10e
relationships,Update: I [F26] have been having intense sexual dreams about my flatmate [M29],"Hi guys! First off I wanted to say thank you for all the comments, they were super insightful for me. 

Feel free to see my last post for context: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/e008nu/i_f26_have_been_having_intense_sexual_dreams/

I just wanted to give an update on the situation and maybe a bit more background to the situation. 

So I recently broke off my ldr of 4,5 years. For a long time I had been coming to terms with the fact that I can't see a future together for the two of us, even though he had been talking about marriage and proposing for ages. There were many things happening in this relationship that added up made me realise that is not something I want to pursue forever. This relationship hadn't been doing it for me emotionally und sexually for quite some time. 

My flatmate and I have been part of a close knit clique for around ten years. For seven of those years he had been in a relationship with another girl from the clique. It turned long distance quite some time ago and didn't work out. They broke it off at the beginning of this year. They talked about how they want to go forward from this and vowed to tell each other about potential new first partners. She has been sleeping around for some time and not directly talked about it with him. 

So after we went drinking and went home we spent some time talking, the topic turned to my birth control situation, the frustration and dreams. At one point he told me to come over to his side of the sofa and asked me if I was talking about him. It was pretty surreal for the both of us I guess. Since then we have been pretty much inseparable, laying around on each other, making out and what not. I feel so happy at the moment and he does too. We have also been doing a lot of talking and being honest with each other. 

He says he wants to hold off on having actual sex, until he's sure he wants to pursue a relationship with me, because he doesn't want anything casual. Of course at this point in time is too early to say if it will work out, but that's OK. I want to see where it goes as I haven't been this genuinely happy in a long time, and I'm so glad he feels the same way. We're concerned about what the rest of the clique will say and how they react once it gets out. Truly a sticky situation. 

I'm ready to see if it works out and I'm ready to commit. I can sincerely say that he is not the reason I broke of my last relationship, but I can understand how it can seem that way. Of course the way we worked together did show me many parts of my last relationship that I was absolutely not happy about. 

Tl;DR it all kinda worked out. We feel the same way about each other and life is good.","I was in a situation very similar to this (long time friend became house share became dating)

3 years later me and the person are married. Not saying it always works like that, but there's nothing inherently wrong with dating a flatmate. I think the taboo comes more from college dorm situations and doesnt really apply to independent adults pushing 30.

After a decade of friendship you know each other well, and being roommates you've already seen them when they're sick, on laundry day, resolved issues over housework. It's actually a great trial run for a relationship, imo 

That said just **tread carefully, use your best judgment, and KEEP YOUR SAME SEPARATE ROOMS** 

Anyway good luck (:",2594,26,2019-11-24 12:37:01,e0y0i4
relationships,"My brother [18M] got caught smoking weed; now my parents [51F, 56M] want to drug test me too [23F] to be ""fair"".","My younger brother, let's call him John \[18\], was subjected to random drug testing at his high school last week. (He knew he was eligible for it, students must sign a consent form at the start of the school year). He is a frequent smoker, and tested positive for weed. He tried to get ahead of the situation by telling my parents what had happened. My parents freaked out, acted like John is a complete failure, and started to think of ways to punish him. My parents and my brother already didn't have a great relationship, and this event made it much worse. Thankfully nothing criminal will come of this, John just has to take an online drug counseling course. He is going off to college this fall.

&#x200B;

I \[23F\] am in graduate school in another state. I never smoked in high school, and now in college it's a very infrequent activity, mostly when I'm home by myself to de-stress or at small social gatherings. Weed has never negatively impacted my life, I've gotten good grades, internships, fully-funded grad school, never in trouble with the law. I've always had a great relationship with my parents and feel close to them. 

&#x200B;

Now, my brother and I haven't always had the greatest relationship. My parents tend to view me as the ""golden child"" and compare my brother and I. I've tried to be close with my brother but I think he feels some anger towards me because of my parents. However, one thing John and I recently bonded over was weed. I suspected he smoked and told him I have too. Our relationship improved a bit, I think it helped him see me as more relatable and more of a friend. We talked about it a few times but never smoked together or anything like that.

&#x200B;

Now, back to my parents finding out about John and freaking out. My parents decided they were going to drug test him from now on, and he could lose his phone, car, and even college if he keeps smoking. Well, John ended up ratting me out to my parents (who had NO idea I'd ever smoked). I think he threw me under the bus to try and make his actions look better. Now, my parents are saying that to be fair, they're going to drug test both of us, and if I test positive they will take my car. My parents seemed like they don't really want to drug test me - in fact, my mom said she would try and tell me in advance of when they would do it - but they want to be ""fair"". Keep in mind, I am still living out of state this summer, so any drug testing would take place when I visit home (which is only going to happen a few times).

&#x200B;

I wasn't planning on smoking the next few months because my internship random drug tests. However, I feel like my parents aren't respecting my decisions and privacy as an adult. It isn't like I still live at home, and weed isn't impacting my life in any way. It was solely my brother's fault that he got caught. Additionally, my boyfriend lives in a state where weed is legal, so really, what do they expect? The only thing that still ties me to my parents is that they own the car I drive. They agreed to let me drive this when I started grad school, as they knew I wouldn't make much money and they valued me furthering my education. However, I pay for everything else myself.

&#x200B;

Do you think my parents are being reasonable? Is it fair to apply John's punishment to me, even though we are at very different stages in our lives? How can I tell my parents I am uncomfortable with this while maintaining a good relationship? And how do I address this breach of trust with my brother? 

&#x200B;

TLDR: My younger brother got caught smoking weed, and my parents plan to randomly drug test him. He snitched to them that I've smoked too, and now they want to drug test me.

Edited to add: My brother came to me right after he was tested asking for help and advice. right after this situation went down, I was very clear with my parents that I have smoked and I thought they were overreacting. I defended my brothers actions and tried to educate them about marijuana. Many people are attacking me for the way my brother has been treated but I have very much supported and defended him.","Tell them, politely to pound sand.

""I've thought about it and I won't be taking a drug test for you.  I have smoked pot on a few occasions, in the past, but haven't recently.  At present, I'm subject to drug tests as a condition of my internship.  But I am an adult and it is legal for me to smoke in several states, BF's included, so if I want to smoke in the the comfort of his home, I will do so.""

Be prepared to return their car, if that's what they want.",2588,210,2019-05-03 21:55:43,bke0dw
relationships,How do I [32F] protect my work relationships from a bad nepotistic hire?,"**TL;DR:** Senior colleague hired his wife to join my team and she sucks, how do I manage the relationship with her and minimise collateral damage to my own relationship with other colleagues who are friends with her?

...

Details:

I work for a small company with 11 employees, soon to be 16. I like my job and most everyone I work with, bar one member of the senior team I'll call Gavin \[40M\]. Gavin isn't the top of the food chain but he has a lot of clout, as the CEO really likes him and handpicked him to join the company based on their past relationship.

Most of the people at my company have worked with each other before in past roles or know each other personally. Hiring friends is the norm, though I'm one of the few ""outsiders"". This hasn't been an issue at all up until recently, when Gavin hired his wife Donna \[F39\] to work part time at the company and asked her to work on some of my projects without consulting me first. I only found out she was going to share projects with me on the day she started.

Unfortunately, Donna is not experienced nor naturally talented in the work she's been assigned. She's been insecure, needy and anxious from day one, and lacks the basic skills necessary to do her job well. I've tried to help her adjust because I would actually welcome some help with my workload, but she pulls me into meetings for an hour or two every time she's in the office, asking me really basic questions and/or just quietly panicking at me. She also does this with CEO, who she knows personally through Gavin.

I've tried to pull away a little bit by not responding instantly to her Slack messages and not accepting every meeting she's tried to book with me. The result has been that she's started interrupting me in meetings, asking basic but usually inappropriate questions addressed to me. I don't think she's intentionally undermining me because she's always grateful when I 'help' her but I'm finding it hard to stay patient. Gavin, of course, always chimes in to support her in team settings.

I've also tried to build my 1:1 relationship with Donna so there's enough trust to establish boundaries, but unfortunately I can't really find much common ground with her. She's quite negative, complaining loudly that no one at the company has their shit together and I feel like she probably says the same things about me to her husband and the CEO outside the office.

There are very subtle signs that the CEO may be starting to realise hiring her wasn't a great idea - if she wasn't Gavin's wife I think she'd definitely be on her way out, so I think my best strategy here is to wait this out and try to stay calm. However, the CEO booked a 1:1 with me next week and if he asks me about Donna I'm not sure what I'll say. I feel the resentment growing, not just at Gavin and Donna, but also at the CEO for not establishing a fair work environment.

I don't want to ruin my place in the company over this. My question is, how do I handle Donna while covering my own ass? And what should I say if asked about what I think of Donna's work?

\*\*EDIT\*\*: Whoa, this blew up. Thanks all for your comments and advice - I just read everything. To clarify a few things:

1. Donna isn't my direct report. We don't have managers at our company, so technically no one is. I wasn't asked to train her, but when I found out on her first day she'd been told to ""support"" some of my projects I sort of had to step in.
2. I don't know if the CEO is going to talk about Donna in our meeting, but I don't like being caught off guard so I'm thinking more 'what if?'
3. She doesn't have a JD or even a title, so I understand her anxiety to some extent as our environment is pretty chaotic. Given her personal connections I told her she could probably just define her own role and give herself any title she wants, but she hasn't done it.
4. I don't ignore her messages, I've just stopped responding \*immediately\* because it fucks up my focus
5. I'm not the only person she's doing this to. She naturally also books Gavin into long meetings and also the CEO . She's the only one who gets this level of attention from the senior team in the company and it's not really sustainable in any case
6. The work I've tried to help her do is still substandard, which is mainly what's worrying me, and she doesn't really have the right mindset for this type of business that I've seen. She might get away with it as just an average employee in a big company, but in this setting it's glaringly obvious.

She's made references a few times that she's been near quitting from stress, so I really don't want to get any more involved in this unless I have to. I don't want to get her fired. But her flailing around, taking up my time is indeed disruptive to my ability to get things done, especially right now because I have additional project work on top of my daily responsibilities. I would just talk to her but I'm afraid she'll take it totally the wrong way because she's so wound up, and I already have a not great relationship with her husband so I don't want any of that backsplash.

I think my best case scenario is that the CEO takes over her coaching completely if he wants her to stay. I don't feel like I can really ask for that directly but maybe I could angle for it.","My advice: Be honest but tactful, and focus on the impact to your work. Even though she's obviously frustrating as hell, don't share that. Say things like, ""It's hard for me to spend the time I need on my own tasking when Donna is asking me to meet with her several hours a day; for example, on both Tuesday and Wednesday I sat with her for ninety minutes answering questions. Is there a better way for me to be handling that?"" ""The document she produced needed an extra two hours of editing before we could give it to the client."" Act in the manner that you aren't complaining, simply giving him information about how things are going and if this is what he wants then that's fine with you. 

And if he indicates that he doesn't want to hear negative things, then stop going down that road for your own sake. But you can't expect him to fix things if nobody has told him what needs fixing - you need to give him a chance to be a good manager until you see that he's not going to take that chance.",2581,52,2019-09-04 09:56:57,cziqqi
relationships,"UPDATE: Me [23F] with my friend [26F] of 2.5 years, who was rude to me and my boyfriend [26M] and now I don't want to include her in our new D&D campaign. How do I tell her?","Previous post is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7cr3lb/me_23f_with_my_friend_26f_of_25_years_who_was/).

Hi r/relationships!

While my original post didn't get much attention, wanted to provide an update as the advice I got was super helpful.

I ended up not mentioning the D&D campaign to her and she never really brought it up and when she did I kept it super vague. The friendship slowly started to fade and we got coffee about 6 months after my post and she spent the entire time talking about herself and life and barely asked me anything about mine. Like of a 2 hour coffee, I maybe spoke for 10 minutes max. I was happy to let the friendship fade because of some other shitty behaviour from her but finally she confronted me over Facebook about it all and I decided to tell her I just didn't want to be friends anymore and I wished her all the best. I felt pretty bad, as it wasn't the nicest thing but I genuinely wasn't keen on staying her friend and was hoping she'd take the hint and just let it fade, and at least she has that closure of me formally ending the friendship? idk. Based on her social, looks like she has lots of great friends now and things are going well for her, which is great. She's a fun person, just not a fit for me I think. 

The D&D campaign went amazingly, my character actually ended up dying and then being resurrected by a different god in order to kill the big bad guy - and my character ending up dealing the finishing blow. We just started a new campaign that M is DMing this time and it's super fun so far. 

In other news, M actually proposed to me a few weeks ago and we just bought a house together. So things are great! And while I don't have tons of friends, the ones I do have are way more fun to play board games and D&D with and I'm making a big effort in 2020 to make more friends. 

Wanted to thank everyone who gave me the advice on the first thread - particularly the person who gave me their permission to lie haha.

relationships,My [25 M] boyfriend’s [26 M] anxiety comes out severely during intimacy.,"Charlie and I have been together about five months now, and things really are pretty good. No major fights despite the occasional disagreement, and I’m genuinely happy being with him.

That said, his anxiety has started coming out really horribly during intimacy, and I’m not really sure what to do about it. 

He has a diagnosis and a regular therapist, and intellectually, I know he cannot help it when those nervous thoughts creep out. I can deal with it from day-to-day and try to be the best support I can be. 

But lately, sexy time has literally devolved into me having to lay there and comfort him 3/4 times we’re in bed. 

The act itself is good. No complaints. But if I’m not vocal enough, he descends into calling himself a “stupid failure who can’t please me.” And then I hold him, assure him he’s not, and repeatedly tell him I’m not leaving him. 

If I’m too vocal, I’m “faking it to make him feel better” and once again, it’s my job to lay there and comfort him. 

Either way, we’re done for the night. 

I came out late. Charlie was my first everything. Being romantic with him is a large place of vulnerability for me, and I just don’t know what to do when this happens. 

I want to be supportive and understand it’s not “about  me.” He can’t help mental illness. But I’d love advice on how to broach this. We need to talk about it. 

But I’m afraid of sending him spiraling. 

TL;DR: Boyfriend has anxiety about performing during intimacy. He’s good; I have no complaints about sex. But he imagines them and it all devolves into me having to comfort him in bed. What can I do?","I've been in relationships with guys like this and I've been the guy like this (not for anxiety reasons, but similar enough), and as a stopgap in the moment, I really recommend agreeing on silence. As in, when he's feeling anxious there's a signal that says we're going to be silent and just hold each other for a bit. No words, no endless tiring comfort, just a moment of silence that always means 'you've done nothing wrong, let's sit through this'. This won't fix anything but it's a strategy in the moment.

relationships,I (F/28) am not sure what to do about creepy housemate (M/27),"Hi Reddit,

I live in a share house with 4 other people, I’ve been living here now for 3 years.
 
One of the housemates let’s call him David has always tried to make cringeworthy jokes to me and thinks he’s really funny. He always thinks he’s right and said little insults to me I.e why do you buy this brand of food, it’s so bad and always asks me about my ex boyfriends. 

I was dating a guy who was a little bigger and his response was “why did you date him? He was such a douche and did the bed break when you were with him”

One night ( a few months ago) he wanted to watch a movie and I agreed. He turned the lights off and halfway through the movie I didn’t feel comfortable. I explained to him I was tired and wanted to go to my room. I left and he started sending me abusive text messages about how I was so rude to leave. I responded back saying I have the right to leave the room if I want to. 

I also explained that I didn’t want anything more to do with him than just a housemate- that’s it. He again got angry saying that he only wanted me as a friend. 

This guy walks around in expensive brands and always has to buy the latest Apple product even though he has perfectly good Apple products already. (He works in a grocery store)

Recently, the last 2 weeks, I’ve decided to buy the game UNO to get everyone together and have some fun as usually everyone sits in there seperate rooms and don’t socialise. 

The only person who wants to play UNO is David. He’s starting to ask me questions like: “have you had sex in the shower before” “we should play UNO in my room” “if you ever want to come into my room, you can” “have you been to a strip club before” 

Lately he’s said to me “we should seriously go for a drive” or “we should go to this particular place where there is a lookout over the city” then when I said “no” he says “we can go anywhere where you want to go”

Last night he says to me “tomorrow let’s go out for dessert after your work” I said “no, because I just don’t want to” 

Since then this guy has completely ignored me and will sit ages away from me on the other side of the room. 

It’s been super awkward and it’s obvious he’s pissed off because I keep rejecting him. 

I’m not sure where to go from here or what to say to him?

I really want him to move out of the house.

TLDR: housemate has made advances towards me and is asking inappropriate questions. He is now ignoring me and it’s super awkward.",[deleted],2567,105,2019-09-02 09:29:00,cyms4r
relationships,UPDATE: My (28F) partner (33M) doesn't want to commit to showing up when he says he will.,"\[UPDATE 10/17\]

Y'ALL

I did not think that many people were going to follow up on this. I didn't include a lot of info bc I didn't want him finding this, but I doubt he reads here sooo:

1. The drinking—he doesn't drink everyday any more. In fact, he stopped drinking for two weeks straight and only had a couple of drinks when he was upset about something. I don't think he's drank since.
2. The weed—he hasn't stopped smoking, but he has stopped smoking during the day. He'll usually smoke at night before we go to bed and that's kinda it.
3. We had a conversation about him going to therapy—he's been in the past and had really bad experiences with it. He doesn't trust therapists, and as we all know with therapy, it only works if you want it it. I can't make him go if he doesn't want to. I don't necessarily like this outcome, but until it becomes hazardous to his health, I'm not going to push it.
4. He didn't trick me into believing that I was the problem. I talked to my therapist, and she pointed out my responses as being emotionally manipulative.
5. I've been single for most of my life; I don't have a problem being single. I don't need another person to validate me. I just happen to like this one.

Reddit, I'm fine. I've been in toxic relationships before that I should have bailed on way earlier. This isn't one of them. You know how I know? Because when we argue, he established the rule that we're on a team, and we're working out a solution together. We obviously don't always remember this, but we've stuck to it. There is no me against him or him against me, it's us against whatever is bringing us down. Also, he made the rule that we should hold hands when we argue or hug after taking a break. It's hard to be mad at someone you're in physical contact with.

Also, thanks to those of you who left well wishes. I don't think there's a right or wrong in this situation, but I think it's easier to pick at a stranger's flaws than it is to believe in their judgement.

tl;dr: get off my back reddit


-----
Previous post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/cxlxvd/my_28f_partner_33m_doesnt_want_to_commit_to/).

tl;dr from last post: My partner won't commit to being on time, when confronted, said he'll now say ""maybe"" to showing up and never give a time.

SO, after reading this and realizing that my partner was having a problem with drugs/drinking and calling multiple friends, I sat down with him after having a blowout fight and had a real conversation about boundaries. I asked him why he didn't want to commit to showing up, and he said he didn't think it was a big deal because he'd been doing it all his life to everyone. Even his close friends, who have confronted him about as well. He was just raised like that where it was never guaranteed that someone would show up, which seems a bit…weird to me.

Some of the ""laziness"" around showing up had to do with his depression, which I totally get. There have been days where I couldn't even make it out of bed. It's not really a choice you have sometimes.

He realized that I was really upset about it (finally), and after I said that I need to feel like I can trust his word, he said he'd try. And it's been about a month, and it hasn't been exactly smooth, but he's stuck to his word—shown up when he said he would, communicated when/if he would be more than an hour late.

Another big thing is that I realized I was behaving in emotionally manipulative ways as well—guilting, shaming, stonewalling. It was in response to his flippancy, but it wasn't helpful for either of us. He's always been calm with me and very clear that he wants to work on our issues together. That's what counts to me.

tl;dr It's not perfect, but we're committed to making it work. We're both growing. (:","So....he’s 33 but never realized that people are generally on time? Does he not have a job? Ever had a doctor or dentist appointment? Ever taken a plane? How does he manage to be on time for those things? 
I think you’re in for a painful relationship with this guy.",2556,78,2019-10-11 08:05:16,dgbygb
relationships,My(27M) wife (25F) is very unhappy and asks me to get rid of or stop doing the things I love to make her happy but it's never enough.,"I have no friends or family so I created an account to ask for help. 

My wife and I have been together for 5 years married for 4, she had a bad marriage before me and had a child. I had no problem stepping up to the plate to help her raise her child (the father wants nothing to do with my wife or his kid)

To the point, I had 2 friends that I've had since I was 16, they were both female and I had dated one of them for 4 years but we split up agreeing that we made better friends then an actual couple. Which never happens in real life apparently. Shes always been my go for advice and I made our friendship 100% transparent for my wife when we first met and never hid anything. Out of habit my friend and I still said we loved each other but more if a platonic love. We both loved our current partners and never wanted anything between each other. However after a few years this took a toll on my wife and she asked me to stop telling her that I loved her. So I explained this to my friend and she said she understood and would have no problem doing so. 

Another month or so I still have 100% transparency with my wife as to make her feel comfortable. I got deployed and my friend had just had her baby and asked me if I wanted to facetime to see her. I said yes naturally happy for her and her husband. After a nice chat and meeting her new son. I got a call from my wife a few days later asking if I had talked to her kn facetime. I told her that I had and why, also telling her what we had discussed. My wife then didnt talk to me the rest of my deployment. When I got home I explained that I was sorry it hurt her feelings and wanted to make things better. She told me to never talk to her again. I tried to explain that its was just a friendship and that neither of us wanted a relationship. 

My wife took it upon herself to call her and tell her that if she didnt stop talking to me forever that she would tell my friends husband that we were having an affair.

She did not tell me any of this. I quickly noticed she had blocked me on everything, including my number. I had no idea what happened so I confronted my wife and she told me that she was certain I was cheating on her and that my friend and I were having an affair. She then told me that she had called her and only asked her to not talk to me anymore. I was slightly upset but stood by her decision and held no grudge. 

I feel like this event led to the breakdown of everything. She started to have no trust in anything I did, constantly going through my phone, and she would constantly lock her phone, or lock herself in the bathroom talking to someone on the phone. 

She started blaming her job for her unhappiness, I told her that I could pull extra hours at work if she wanted to quit to find a new one. She quickly quit her job and made no attempt to find work agajn.

I was enlisted at the time. She said she hated that I was gone all the time so I offered to go reserves to be with her more. She said that would fix it. So I got a civilian job that paid decent but we had to move. 

The job is stressful and I'm not very fond of being a civilian. She has now come to the conclusion that I need to get out of the military and quit my civilian job and we to move again and that's the only way she'll be happy. 

I feel like I've given up everything for her to be happy, I'm trying to show her the logic that there is no way for us to survive if neither of us work.

I love my wife and dont want a divorce but I feel like she will never be happy and I'm not sure how to fix it. She blames everything on me and says that I'd be happier with someone else or says shes leaving again.

I'm currently deployed again and the last week I was home she wouldn't talk to me or spend time with me and our daughter. She would lock herself in the bedroom all day. Then at night she would call me names and say I dont care about her and I never spend time with her. 

Im very confused because I'm not the best with emotions, I'm a logical man and I see no logical answer here.

Any thoughts or advice would be great. Thank you!

TL:DR My wife is unhappy and refuses to do anything about it. She blames all of these problems on me, yet refuses to even let me try. She is constantly going through my phone or asking me if I'm cheating. She keeps asking me to give up the things I love in an attempt to make her happy","There is no logic. She is abusive, i know this is hard to hear but you need to leave. A partner should not ask you to give up your work, your friends, and everything you enjoy so they can be happy.

relationships,"[UPDATE] My [F26] sister [F23] keeps posting personal details of our relationship on her public blog/twitter. She doesn’t seem to understand why I don’t like this, and I am at my wits end.","Figured I'd give an update to this situation as it's almost been 2 years since the original post. Link below:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6f7yz5/my\_f26\_sister\_f23\_keeps\_posting\_personal\_details/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6f7yz5/my_f26_sister_f23_keeps_posting_personal_details/)

&#x200B;

After reading through everyone's responses and taking time for myself to see how I really felt about the whole situation, I did as I said I was going to do, and blocked my sister on all forms of social media. I also cut her out of my life (albeit, temporarily). For about 8 months, I didn't speak to her, nor make any attempts at communicating with her.  That summer (so about 2 months after I had stopped contact with her), my sister moved away for school. My mother eventually got wind of the situation from my brother (who was 24 at the time and has never been particularly close with our younger sister) and asked me why I wasn't talking to my sister.

Initially she was judgmental, but after explaining to her my sisters repeated behavior of posting personal details about me online (including my phone number and details about my sex life), my mother was furious and agreed that I had every right to cut her out of my life. At one point, my mother, during a phone conversation with my sister, called her out, calling my sister childish, petty, and vindictive and said that if she ever found out that she was posting any intimate details about ANY family members online like that again, she wouldn't hesitate to find a lawyer. She also threatened to kick my sister out of the house if she didn't stop her nonsense (while she was away at school, she did live at my mom's house during summer breaks/holidays).  I'm not sure if there was any actual legal repercussions my mom could have actually made against her, but it was enough to make my sister set her blog/twitter to private after my mom browbeat her into submission for being so shitty.  Due to this, my sister and my mom had a huge falling out as well, with my sister repeating the same old adage of how it was her ""personal"" blog/twitter so she could do whatever she wanted with it/on it.

Christmas rolled around and me and sister still weren't talking, and while my mom had patched things up with her to a degree, it was an awkward holiday. Me and my brother both live independently. When we went over to visit for holiday stuff, were civil and polite towards our sister, but we never failed to notice her on her phone 24/7. We could only speculate what she was doing, but I was less bothered now that she had set her blogs to private. Regardless, during a dinner at one point, she was on her phone and my mom asked her to put her phone down so we could have ""family"" time. She responded along the lines of ""yeah, one minute"", and my brother made a jab about how she was probably too busy posting ""bullshit lies"" about us on the internet. I should mention that while my sister doesn't seem to care what I think/ask of her, she has always seemed to respond and care about what my brother thinks. She tried to fight him on his comment for a minute, but he shut her down, calling her ""a fucking child"" who just wants ""internet points"" and straight up said that if she was "" a decent fucking human being"" she would talk to us about her problems instead of cowering behind a screen.  She shut up after that and retreated to her room after dinner was done.

After Christmas, I continued to have zero contact with her. I would hear about how she was doing in school via our mom from time to time, but still had her blocked on all social media. She came home for the summer to work, and that summer our Grandma (my deceased father's mother ) died. My sister ended up having a complete breakdown due to the culminating and unworked through grief surrounding our father (who had died 2 years previous) and now our Grandma. She started going to therapy and actually taking her medication.

Eventually, she reached out and apologized to me about her behavior the past few years. We had a sit down that fall, over some beers and talked about everything that had happened and her behavior. I told her while I accepted her apology, it would take some time for me to work through her how behavior had affected me and our relationship. I unblocked her on FB so we could make a group chat with our brother as a buffer. We now occasionally talk, but we still aren't as close as we used to be when we were younger. I actually went to lunch with her the last time she was in town and it felt...okay. So that's it, here we are.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:**

Blocked my sister on all forms of social media and cut contact, only participating in it during holiday events/funerals. Brother and mother supported my decision and made it clear to her they didn't stand for her behavior. Sister ended up going to therapy and actually taking her medication and later apologized. We occasionally talk now, but we aren't close anymore.","Unfortunately these things take time.

relationships,[UPDATE]- My (32/F) boyfriend (33/M) forged a document.,"Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3tu5il/my_29f_bf_30m_of_4_years_forged_a_document/

So when I left you all, I was supporting Jay as he picked up the pieces. It ended up that we were lucky that his transgression (forging a document) ended up being mostly covered up except that he was fired... He didn't end up with legal repercussions at least.

Jay ended up starting a new career teaching in our field. He's doing so well that he has been promoted recently to an associate professor position at a well respected college. Everyone loves him as a teacher.

There are so many more stories about this that I'm writing a memoir (but damn, I'm not a good writer!). Like the person that first reported him ended up being in love with me and I had to get a restraining order against him...

In sadder news, after supporting him for two years as he got his life together, I've fallen into depression and alcoholism. Apparently this happens sometimes to caretakers? I'm still keeping it together at work somehow, but could definitely be excelling if it wasn't for the drinking... I'm working on it and have just started going to AA, but it's definitely something that we need to work on in therapy more (which we both go to). 

I hope to provide you a super happy update where we both are crushing it in the near future, but for now, this is where we are at. 

Open to suggestions from those that have been through related situations.

Tldr: my bf messed up a few years ago and I currently feel the consequences. I need to forgive him. Looking for good experiences related to this.","Hey OP!

I cared for my (now ex-) girlfriend for 18 months while she had significant mental health issues, and also turned to alcohol as a way of coping. It went badly for me, and I stopped drinking just after New Year.

I can highly recommend the /r/stopdrinking subreddit (are you allowed to link subreddits on this subreddit?), as it provided me with a lot of support and comfort when I was struggling.

Therapy is always useful, but have you seen a psychiatrist too? You and the psych may decide to try a medication such as an SSRI (which I've been prescribed), and they can really help! Also, is the type of therapy you're receiving the most suitable for your situation? I'm receiving trauma-focused CBT, but could have gone for EMDR, as I was diagnosed with PTSD after everything had settled. Might just be something to think about!

Best of luck with everything ahead - I hope your partner is supporting you.",2538,35,2019-08-13 06:18:15,cpp3h9
relationships,My (23f) bf (24m) is driving me crazy with how rude he is at night because he’s a light sleeper and I’m not,"My bf and I have been together over a year and living together about 6 months. He’s an EXTREMELY light sleeper. We never used to have problems but I’m now on medicine that causes me to have more insomnia so it’s harder for me to fall asleep. Lately, we’ve gotten into fights because he’s being absolutely unrealistic about any noise in general. I can’t clear my throat quietly, sneeze or even yawn without him grumbling, groaning, or yelling at me at how “loud” I’m being. When I say yawn, I don’t mean some exaggerated TV yawn, but literally the sound of me silently taking in and expelling air from my mouth 3-4x over the course of 2 hours sets him off. Sneezing is very rare and it’s also quiet but if I have to make any noise, I do it as silently as possible, but it’s not enough for him. When I was extremely sick with the cold, he made ME sleep on the couch because I was having a tough time sleeping without being able to actually blow my nose to breathe. But, when he caught it a week later, I gladly let him sleep in the bed and helped take care of him when he woke up in the night because he wasn’t feeling well. 

I’ve argued with him multiple times that it’s unfair for him to expect absolute silence and be mad over the AIR he hears from a YAWN but he just shuts me down and tells me to be quiet because I’ve disturbed him from being “right on the edge of sleep.” I understand that when you’re half asleep you’re particularly grumpy, we’ve all been there, but it winds me all the way up that I already constantly have to cater to the way he needs tons of space (meaning I have to sleep pencil straight all night or on the side not facing him if I want to move my legs at all) and then this sound thing. I’ve had previous bf’s who were heavy sleepers that snored, made lots of noise and honestly that bothered me less than constantly having to be alert to his needs. 

He says that ear plugs don’t work and he only likes to hear the fan so white noise is out of the question. I don’t want to go downstairs because then I’ll just stay up and I don’t want to keep taking melatonin every night but I’m this close to not renewing our lease together next year if things don’t change. It also makes me feel like if we got married and had kids he’d just expect me to be up all the time dealing with the baby so he can sleep or complaining about his sleep or if one of us was to have a chronic sickness that we’d have to sleep in different bedrooms because of how selfish he is. What should I do? 

TL;DR: bf is being selfish and unrealistic about any noise, no matter how quiet, that disrupts him from sleeping

Edit: for now, sleeping in separate bedrooms would not be an option since we live with 2 other roommates until we graduate from college in May so the only other spot is the couch which would be inconvenient for everyone involved. Also, I’m not the kind of person that wants to sleep separate from their partner if I can help it.

Edit 2: WOW. This is my first post to have ever blown up. Thank you everybody for all your insightful responses! Truthfully, a lot of you are correct in the fact that his selfishness and gaslighting extends to many other parts of the relationship. There have been many times where we’ve almost broken up but he always wants us to work out so it doesn’t happen. Personally, I had life threatening blood clots in my lungs over the summer (hence the medicine I have to take to live which makes me an insomniac) that he was there for every step of the way. So it’s hard to end the relationship after going through something like that with someone you love and worrying that the next person wouldn’t get all the feelings that come with it. I’m going to talk to him again and see what compromises HE can bring to the table. If not, I think it’s time for a break.",[removed],2535,246,2019-12-14 07:30:50,eaguyy

relationships,My [24F] best friend [27F] replaced me as godmother to her baby with no explanation. How do I talk to her about it?,"I’m not really sure how to start this post so I’ll just give some backstory first:

One of my best friends lives in a different country. We met years ago online and have talked almost daily to what is approaching a decade. We have both flown back and forth once or twice a year to see the other and hang out, and we’ve always been their for each other’s big moments. 

She found out last year that she is expecting her first child, and it was amazing news for us all, I was so happy for her to start the family I know she’s always wanted with her husband [31M]. She came to visit a few months into her pregnancy and asked me to be the baby’s godmother - I was over the moon. 
While we live an 8 hour plane ride from each other, I do have a job that gives me decent vacation allowance and deals with certain airlines that makes visiting manageable. I knew that I could be there for her, and told her that whenever she was ready for someone outside of the family to be there, I would make the trip. 


Last month, she had her baby shower, and I only found out when I saw on Instagram a mutual friend [28F] who lives in the same city as me, had surprised her at the shower. I hadn’t been invited. I was a little hurt, and surprised, but it was the busiest month of the year for the company I work for, and I knew she knew that, so I figured that could be the reason, sent my gift by airmail and said congratulations. 

However now she’s reached out to me, and told me that she has asked another friend (the same person who went to the baby shower) to be the baby’s godmother, and that she only wants her child to have one. I felt like I’d been punched in the gut. I was heartbroken, and felt a bit betrayed, for 6 months I have been excited to take on the role - my own godmother lives in New Zealand, and has done for most of my life, so I knew it could work.m, knew how to stay in contact and be a part of the child’s life while living in another country. But now she’s taken back her offer, and chosen someone else.

I wouldn’t be so upset if she had chosen someone who lived closer, but she has replaced me with someone who lives in the same city as me, so it’s not a distance thing. We have been friends for years, I have been there with updates, support and love her whole pregnancy, and at no point was there any clue she had changed her mind... until the baby shower a few weeks ago. 

I don’t know if I should confront her, tell her I’m hurt, or just accept her decision, it’s her baby, and I would never want to force her into a decision she wasn’t happy with. I just don’t know what to do or say to her now. I want to let her know I’m sad that I’m missing out, but I don’t want to sound like I’m whining, and I want to know why she changed her mind, but I’m scared the answer will just upset me. What should I do? 


TL:DR: My best friend asked me to be the godmother of her child months ago, now, with the due date approaching, she’s chosen someone else and given no explanation. How do I tell her that hurts without sounding selfish? ",I’d reach out and mention that you didn’t receive an invitation to the baby shower. She may have thought you were invited and ignored the invitation.,2438,70,2019-03-01 12:21:02,aw49k1
relationships,I [37/F] absolutely cannot stand my coworker [48/F] - How can I deal with this woman?,"Have you ever just met someone who embodies everything you hate? This is that person for me. We work in a very small department (for about 2 years now) and she is practically within arms length of me. Why cannot I not stand her? Well..

She talks all day long. To me, to others, to her sister on the phone, etc. If you don't talk to her, she gets her feelings hurt and then huffs and puffs all day long. Or she leaves and goes to some other department to talk about us. 

She fights with someone at least once a day. Me, her husband, her sister, our boss. Speaking of which...

If I say ""it's a nice day out"" - I will get 100 reasons back on why it isn't a nice day. She can literally argue about anything with anyone. The one time I stopped the ""fight"" and told her I didn't care about what we were arguing about - she cried for the rest of the afternoon. 

I get constant commentary on my actions - especially with food (I am on a diet and SHOULD be). God forbid I don't eat the amount of food she thinks I should. It is like having the mother you never wanted telling you your not eating enough. OH...she is also a ""vegan"" (Except for the **bacon** she eats every morning). 

So we get preachy commentary also about meat, straws, recycling, animals, tree-hugging (literally) etc. All while she eats bacon, uses 100 Styrofoam cups a day, has non-neutered pets etc. Basically shes a hypocrite. 

Gotta go to the bathroom? Well you should have asked her also if she needed to go so you both could go together. If its time to go to a meeting together she will yell rudely ""are we going or not?"". She acts like we are all joined at the hip. 

Are you cold? Well she is colder. Are you sick? She's been sicker. Family member died? Well hers are deader. We are always in some weird competition with her. Especially if it has to do with being seen as small, sickly, victim-y. It is so bizarre. 


She doesn't pull her weight at work. She is hidden from our bosses view - so she spends hours on her phone. If you try to get her to help out or cover for someone on vacation she gives about 100 reasons why she can't or just flat out doesn't do what she says she will. 

My boss is useless in this situation (shes a pushover). I wear earbuds but we are so close that unless I blow out my eardrums, I can hear all of this. I am at the point where I am considering quitting over her. I am a really laid back, introverted person and she exhaust me. I get this dread on Sunday afternoon from having to be around her again. Anyone have any suggestions on how to deal with her. My job is otherwise a pretty sweet situation, I would like to keep it for awhile. Thanks!

TLDR - How do you deal with a co-worker who gets under your skin like it's their job? 



","You need to gray rock her. Limit unnecessary conversation, and when you do talk to her, be as boring as possible. Don't express any strong opinions or argue with her. If she tries to suck you into her negativity, just blandly agree with whatever nonsense she's spouting and walk away. Don't feed her appetite for drama.",2414,112,2019-03-03 19:48:29,awxq0c
relationships,[Update]I (26F)made a pros and cons list about my bf(28M) because I’m desperate for clarity. (Together 3 years.) Is it salvageable?,"[Original Post Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/bltkvn/i_26fmade_a_pros_and_cons_list_about_my_bf28m/)

So my last post wasn't that big on here, but since a lot of ya'll were very helpful, I wanted to update you guys. 

 I sat my boyfriend down (with a dairy queen blizzard lol) to talk to him about why he stopped going to therapy before we dated, and how his cranky/sad/numb/back to happy days were taking a toll on me, and whether he would consider going to therapy with me. He stopped me there, and told me how he's been feeling the past few months. He told he how exhausted he is from feeling like he's disappointed me. And how he feels like he's walking on egg shells because if he disagrees with me on certain things, I get upset(to clarify- I'm a very sensitive person and if I feel misunderstood in a conversation, I will cry. This has led to him feeling like he can never be blunt or he has to be very careful in how he words things.) Which is totally valid and something I'm gone to therapy for in the past.


It was obvious to me he was wanting to break up from the first few minutes. We spent the next couple hours talking about where we both went wrong and apologized to each other. I told him I was so sorry for making him feel like I wasn't proud of him and made him feel like he couldn't relax or be himself. He told me how sorry he was for letting himself go. He also said he felt like he was holding me back in a lot of ways and that we both seem to be better versions of ourselves when we're by ourselves, which is probably true.


We held each other and cried a lot. He said he has a lot of respect for me and that I was worth every headache and asked me to please never date someone who isn't worthy of my time. I told him if he needed to go to bed or have some alone time to go smoke that was okay, but he said, ""I've left you alone too many times in our relationship. The least I can do is be there for you tonight and hold you."" <<<<<--ughh kill me, i love him so much...


I'm beyond devastated but I know this is for the best in the long run. A relationship shouldn't be this hard 3 years in. I had no idea how much of his unhappiness was due to me. It hurts, but now I know what I need to work on going forward. I deeply appreciate him coming out with the truth and initiating the breakup because if I thought he wanted to stay together, I don't think I could have gone through with it. I'm not strong at all. I just set up an appointment with my therapist. I hope he can give me something to help me sleep the next few months because I'm worried how this will affect my attendance at work and such. I'm currently waiting for him to get off work so we can start deciding who is moving out(i told him he could stay but he may be moving back to the town his family is in so idk) and how we're going to tell people. I'm going to miss him so much. I feel like I'm dying and feel so sick to my stomach but I know it will get better in time. I hope he finds happiness going forward, he definitely deserves it.


TL;DR: My boyfriend was questioning our future just like I was and we broke up.","This is an amazing story. It is clear how much you both love each other. But sometimes things don't work out. It is very painful but all you can do is be grateful for your time together and start to heal. As someone who has gone through something similar, I know how it is likely one of the hardest things you have ever gone through. But you will both be happier for it one day, even if you can't see it right now. Best of luck in your healing journey.",2407,55,2019-05-10 16:59:09,bn0r7r
relationships,UPDATE My sister (37F) accuses me of favoring my nephew (9M) over my niece (9F),"Update to [this post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/dln57i/my_sister_37f_accuses_me_22f_of_favoring_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

A lot of stuff went down yesterday....
My parents took all four grandkids to a trampoline place, so Anna and Michelle and their husbands were over to pick them up and stay for dinner. After dinner, Anna announced that she’s pregnant. I guess because of being over 35 she got this test called an NIPT and now she knows the baby’s gender even though she’s only 12 weeks. It’s a girl. Anna wasn’t supposed to be able to have any kids, so we were all happy for her. Except Michelle.

Once the dads took the kids downstairs to play in the playroom my parents have set up there, Michelle went off. She said Anna went and took the only thing she has left being best at (having the only granddaughter). I was going to leave because I don’t like being around when my sister fight, but then Michelle brought up the Universal trip and Ben. She said that she knows it’s wrong, but after Anna “took” having the oldest grandkid from her, she was at least happy that her kid had nothing wrong with her. Especially in the beginning, where Ben had a lot more issues and was really behind. He could barely talk when he was adopted. 

Now, Lily’s teacher and other people (her friends parents) are noticing that Lily might have attention problems. Apparently, the whole trip thing just was one thing too many. Even though she admitted that there’s no reason for it and my parents have always treated us the same, Michelle said she’s always felt competitive and second best to Anna. Now even I seem to like Anna’s kid better. 

Anna was kind of shocked at all this. She did get a little mad when Michelle was talking about how Lily was better than Ben, but they ended up crying and hugging each other. 

I told Michelle I would return the American Girl doll and take a trip to the AG store (which is within reasonable driving distance of us) and let Lily pick it out herself. Michelle said she and her husband will start the process of getting Lily evaluated. 

TL:DR! It wasn’t just about the trip.",Aside from your sister’s issues...  Thank you for being Ben’s hero. That kid is really lucky to have you in his life.,2402,58,2019-10-27 13:41:22,dntdhu
relationships,"My [29M] fiancée [30F] is obsessed with her side business, and it's taking over our lives.","Background: I'm a graduate student, just wrapping up my PhD, living in LA. My fiancée and I have been dating for two years, and engaged for three months. She works in corporate strategy at a big company. Neither of us make a lot of money, we live in a tiny 1 BR/BA.

Recently, one of our friends [27F] started selling jewelry and other little handmade trinkets via an online store (Etsy). It's going well, she's selling about one thing a day and making a bit of money on the side.

I'm pretty sure my fiancée got envious. She's artsy at heart, and often looked for a side-gig. After our friend started selling crafts, my fiancée tried her hand at a number of things -- jewelry, pottery, etc. until she settled on paper flowers.

My fiancée has made _thousands_ of paper flowers over the past two months. 

She's been trying to sell them online, and has gotten some success -- selling a few dollars' worth every day. That wasn't enough though, so she's also been selling them at markets, fairs, and plainly on the streets after work. 

However, the paper flowers don't make much money. Though we're not ""well off"" by any means, she still makes more money at her day job. 

But I've caught her skipping her day job to sell flowers! In the last two weeks, she's actually been taking sick days and ""working from home"" in the mornings, telling her boss she's on calls or stuck in traffic when she's actually spending the first three hours of the day going door-to-door hawking paper flowers.

And don't get me wrong. They're nice flowers. She's doing a great job at making them, and her drive is impressive. But I feel as if it's an obsession that's taking over her life, when she should be prioritizing her real work, and frankly, our relationship. We've been less intimate and have had less time for dates and other fun things because she's always working on the paper flowers. The closest we get these days is when I help her bring flower packages to the post office, or when I'm helping her take photos of the flowers. Stuff like that. I feel like I've become an accessory to her side business (which, I repeat, doesn't actually make much money at all). 

It's had impacts in other ways as well. Hanging out with our friends is a struggle now, because my fiancée doesn't want to talk about anything but the flowers. She's always carrying some in her purse, showing them off, and if a friend shows only a little bit of interest, my fiancée will try to sell them some. It's awkward. 

I have no idea what to do. I'm considering taking a break and moving back in with my parents (also in LA) for a few weeks while hoping for her to stabilize. But that seems extreme. What should I do?

---

**TL;DR;** : Fiancée is obsessed with her arts-and-crafts side business, which doesn't make a lot of money, but it's totally taking over her life, hurting her other priorities and our relationship. What should I do?","You're right to be concerned. Having a hobby is one thing, but skipping out on her day job to do this is concerning. Sit her down and ask her what her goal is with this flower business. Remind her that her day job should still be her priority.",2398,77,2019-02-24 21:07:43,aucle3
relationships,"UPDATE - Fred didn't turn up to the stag do, today I will uninvite him to the wedding.","Original Post - https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/buei18/i_25m_asked_a_friend_29m_to_my_stag_do_wedding/

My original post got a handful of really helpful comments & wanted to start by thanking each of them for taking the time to help me realise the problem & how to make the best of the situation.

So I returned from my stag do yesterday. Absolutely quality weekend with great company, voice has gone a little & had the odd tipple. Wouldn't have changed anything about it, exactly what I was hoping for.

Since the last post, I got a call from Fred last week while I was at work. At a time of day that is inconvenient for almost everyone with a 9-5 job, so I couldn't answer.

I sent him a text message that evening, I decided to strip away anything that didn't get to the point: ""Hey dude, what's up?"", taking elements of the grey rock method which I've since learnt about. He replied two days later saying that he just wanted a catch up, I simply said I was looking forward to catching up on the stag do. I sent him a happy birthday message in the week, no response. That was it until the weekend.

What I didn't know until we were on the stag do was he had been messaging my best man separately, and within the space of the week before had told him the following:

- He wouldn't be able to arrive on the Friday, but would join on Saturday. (He ended up going out on Friday evening for birthday drinks with his partner & posted a picture onto Instagram)
- He wouldn't be able to make the Saturday morning activity, but would join in the afternoon.
- He wouldn't be able to make the Saturday afternoon activity, but would be around in the evening.

Fred had only been messaging because some of the activities required deposits & my best man had been chasing him. I'm told he hadn't contributed any ideas or messages into the group while it was being planned.

Saturday rolled around & I finally got a message from Fred saying he won't be coming. He said a family member had an operation in the week & had returned home yesterday.

Firstly, I wish that family member a speedy recovery. To me, it doesn't matter the reasoning but more the fact that Fred waited until the last possible moment before once again letting me down. This has now happened dozens of times where Fred cancels, delays or says yes until the day & then ghosts us until we are all travelling home, this is far from the first time.

Coupled with his Instagram picture the night before, which was presumably taken the day his family member got home, I've decided to uninvite him from the wedding, and will respond to his message today. 

If Fred had messaged me last week saying he may not be able to come because reasons, I may have given him the benefit of the doubt. Waiting until the day to drop the news is normal for him.

The main reason alongside a poor communicator being I don't know this person anymore. He doesn't show any interest in keeping this friendship going and I am sure that if I dropped the rope we'd go to zero contact instantly. I've seen Fred once in 3 years & I was hoping inviting him to the stag do would kick him into gear, he's had 10 months to back out or tell me he may not have been able to. He was a big part of my enjoyment during university & I wanted to give him that chance.

I already expected the stag do & wedding to be the last time I saw Fred as I was putting too much effort into the relationship for zero reward. It is such a shame that it happened how it did.

I had the best group of guys with me all weekend & we had a blast the entire time, and am really looking forward to the wedding where I can get my family & friends together to celebrate with my  future wife & I. 

No more negativity or stress over a friendship that finished a long time ago.

Tl;dr - Friend decided to let me know at the last moment he wouldn't be turning up, after dozens of similar instances I've decided to uninvite him from the wedding.","This happened to my best friend by one of her bridesmaids (one of three very close friends acting as bridesmaids too so had a larger impact than one of like ten). She claimed she’d love to be a bridesmaid but then took zero interest in helping the bride or even checking in to see how plans were going, didn’t attend the hen do (cancelled literally a week before and asked for her money back after I’d booked and paid for everything, also claimed it was too anxiety inducing but went to a different event with different friends the same day), then cancelled being a bridesmaid (4 weeks before the wedding after her dress had been bought etc). We’d all been friends for over a decade but she had depression and anxiety for years that she’d not done much to treat, and she kind of just expected us to accept when she bailed/couldn’t keep commitments. Which is manageable if you didn’t rely on her/didn’t expect anything from her friendship but not acceptable when she’d accepted being part of a wedding party. I think you’re also more forgiving of things like that when you’re 17 but by late 20s... not so much.

After she cancelled on the hen do and asked me for the money back from the hen do, I said no as didn’t want to be out of pocket and she text me asking if there was a problem because she was ‘so fucking upset’ about the situation. I was really honest and said the way she’d treated the bride made me reassess the way she’d treat me when I needed her, and that it was disappointing she was cancelling so late and had chosen to spend time with other friends over her oldest friend’s hen do. She took that to mean I hated her and that I judged her for being mentally ill, swore at me and that was it - 4 text messages ended a 13-year friendship. She has now cut off the bride and groom too.

She needed a lot of emotional energy, patience and support but couldn’t give it to others. What was really telling to me was that there was zero empathy for the bride or like ‘I’m so sorry I can’t make it, I feel awful for bride but I just can’t face it, I’ll do something else nice for her that I can manage’, it was just ‘I’M so upset about this situation’. Also got her boyfriend to ring bride to cancel being a bridesmaid, she was ‘too upset’ to have that conversation herself.

She thinks I hate her but I don’t - I’m just honest with friends and she outright asked me if there was a ‘problem’ (and I’d hope they are with me too) and she couldn’t acknowledge her own behaviour, and instead jumped to me ‘hating her’ and ‘thinking she’s a bitch’. And then cut everyone off.

So yeah idk, it sucks but honestly man it’s not a loss to lose someone who doesn’t want to/can’t give you time or care about things important to you. They aren’t really a friend to begin with.",2371,64,2019-07-08 09:50:04,caj12k
relationships,"My (35F) boyfriend (33M) of 5 years secretly took a cab to take ""a walk"" at night while out of town.","My 33M boyfriend is in San Fran for an interview. We were video chatting w/ our 3 year old after the interview yesterday. Saying he missed us etc. All normal happy stuff.

He left NJ at 3am for the flight there, told us he was exhausted and headed to bed.

I messaged him at 2:10am my time (11:10pm his) that I was up bc our 3 yo wet the bed again. He responded with 'poor girl' and nothing else.

This morning we video call him as was planned during breakfast for our kid to say hello to daddy. He answers without video which is not normal. We call frequently with video. I asked when did you get home and he kinda hesitated before saying 3am. He offered nothing else.

I found this morning he took a lyft to Chinatown at 1120pm PST and didn't cab back to his hotel til 3am.

He messages me nothing, says nothing so I message him after breakfast about being out all night and he says he needed to take a walk. Says no cheating happened.

This man has a terrible sense of direction. Cant read a map etc. But went for a walk in a city he doesnt know from 1130pm-3am... Huh?

And mentioned nothing about it even though he knew I was awake here at the same time changing sheets on the east coast. Why not mention that he cant sleep and am headed out? No pictures or comments about his walk. Says he was going to mention it in the morning.

Thoughts? My nerves are shot. He has a major history of being dishonest. This was our time to be transparent and open to rebuild trust for our family. Why leave his hotel (which is already on the water with a fantastic view) in the middle of the night?

I'm ready to pack up and leave him.

**Edited to add (after suggestions from commenters): He started living sober in December but also has a deep history with gambling and prostitution.  I made some serious and stupid concessions to forgive and rebuild because of history, hope, having not many options of my own and a small child. Seems he is possibly making the same choices and traveling the same path anyway.  He makes a lot of promises and I wanted to believe we were building but is apparently allergic to truth and loyalty. **

TL;DR Boyfriend out 1130pm-3am when he said was going to bed. Has history of lies, says didnt cheat. Says couldnt sleep, took a 20 dollar cab to Chinatown to ""go for a walk"".

relationships,My(25f) mom(72f) and sister(32f) are mad because I wont help them commit fraud.,"My sister owns a house and is currently in the process of losing it. She wants me to help her out by saying I live there and pay rent to help her refinance her mortgage. I however do not live there. I moved out a year or so ago and had a baby. I am currently living with my boyfriend in a different city. My mom is really mad at me shes saying that she doesnt understand why I dont just do it and that they could lose the house if I dont do it. She told a close relative that I have until Monday in a threatening way.My sister told me it'll be my fault if they end up homeless and she tried to throw in my nieces being homeless as well.

The thing is they use to do fraud all the time like it was no big deal and they want me to i guess follow blindly. They never learned their lesson from committing fraud because they havent been caught. They would take money out of my dad's account(somewhere around 15 thousand in total) and open credit card and phones under his name. My dad was from another country and sadly didnt know how any of those things worked or how to check on them. My mother is evil. I wont go into the things that she did to him or I or the rest of her children but shes bad enough to the point where I wont trust her alone with my daughter.

my father passed away last year. . I knew what they were doing was wrong and begged them not to do it and even got yelled at and scolded for trying to make them stop on several occasions. I never went to my dad though to let him know what was going on. I was scared he would leave us and now I know that was selfish and I should have just told him. Although I wasnt the one to take his money I have a lot of guilt for not speaking up I was around 17 at the time. I regret my silence to the fullest.

Anyways here we are in the present and I'm made out to be the bad guy because I wont cooperate. For some reason they cant get it through their head that I dont want to chance getting fraud on my record. I can't do that to my daughter. I cant do that to my boyfriend. I cant do that that to myself. I feel like this is it. This is what's going to end our (mom and sister)relationship. I should also throw in that they both are pill poppers. It's a touchy subject with them. I get yelled at anytime I mention them and pills In the same sentence even when it's in a concerning heartfelt way. I'm hoping they dont try to forge the paper work or my signature. Part of me thinks they will if they somehow convince themselves that they can get away with it. I love my family I do...but I've realized they dont love me or at least not in a sincere way. Not if they treat me like shit for not wanting to commit fraud. They cant even try to look at it from my perspective.

I tried to decline doing the refinance for the mortgage thing in a nice proper way but that didnt go over too well... Anyone have any suggestions on maybe how to end this on proper terms? Or is this good enough reason to go no contact with family?

Update:  I just found out my work  didnt update my change my address when I put the forms in and now my w2's were sent to my old address (there's) I'm scared they can use these instead of my pay stubs and come my signature.  Everyone at work says they recieved theirs.  My mom said mine arent there yet idk if I believe her


Tl;dr sister and mom want me to say that I'm living with them and contributing to the household so she can refinance her mortgage. I'm not doing either of those things and dont feel comfortable with the idea of committing fraud. Mom keeps persisting and wont take no as an answer. Shes trying everything in her power to get me to go along with it. How do I make it clear that the answer is no???","If you haven't, already, you need to check your credit report to make sure they haven't used your information for identity theft.

relationships,I (35F) not sure if my marriage is going to work out with husband (45M).,"My tl;dr is at the bottom. 

My husband (45M) and I (35F) have been together for 10 years. We have two children, an 8 year old and a 9 month old. My husband was a very nice husband before I was pregnant and during my second pregnancy. After our second baby was born he started being very mean to me. He has always been a bit selfish, but it was always something I could handle before.

He tries to ruin things I have planned. As an example, I was going to take my dad to an event and my husband calls me and tells me he is going to be two hours late to watch the kids because he has to go shopping. Then he tries to push me to be mad at him. He will say, does this upset you? Are you getting mad? Then he will act like I’m the crazy person when I do get upset with him. 

He makes fun of my hobbies or puts down and activity I do.  I actually took up running because he likes it and it was something I could do without him making fun of me. We planned to go on a run together and I set up a babysitter for an hour. I was waiting for him to show up and he never did. When I asked him what he was doing he said he was running. So he left me hanging while he still got to enjoy the activity. This also wasted a precious hour of babysitting time. 

He is also unnecessarily cruel. I went on a four day trip with our two kids. He stayed at home because he had to work. When I came home he told me that maybe he could pick me up from the airport but maybe not. I told him it’s fine I will take a cab. But even up until I got on my plane ride he was telling me if he was free he would be at the airport but there was no guarantee. Then after I got home he immediately started lecturing me on spending money on our older son. Which, after a four day trip of taking care of two kids (one being a baby) I was just exhausted and didn’t want to be lectured the second I walked through the door. So I just told him I agree with you and I’m sorry. But he just kept going and going. 

Other examples of him being cruel are him telling a family member that I can’t handle the baby by myself. pouring a pop down the sink that I gave him saying he doesn’t want that pop and then grabbing the exact same brand of pop out of the fridge to drink.  

I could go on but I think these might be enough examples. Like I mentioned earlier, these behaviours have been happening after our second baby was born. As things happen I do usually call him out on the spot, but he usually gaslights me in the moment and we get nowhere. He wants to go to couples therapy or just personal therapy for himself (his idea). But I’m honestly wondering is it worth it? I would prefer not to divorce but I’m honestly wondering if we could save this marriage or should I just walk away? 

Tl;dr: husband has been treating me very badly for several months. He wants to go to couples therapy but I feel like the damage is done. How do I proceed?",[removed],2312,144,2019-04-12 21:39:13,bcj70v
relationships,UPDATE: How do I (21m) tell my older brother (27m) that I’m addicted to drugs,"[Original Post] (https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/a1n4rf/how_do_i_21m_tell_my_older_brother_27m_that_im/?st=JSDCPU1X&sh=6f94cd15)

My original post didn’t get a huge amount of attention but some people were asking for an update when I had one so here goes. 

Long story short, I guess I wasn’t hiding my addiction very well (shocker I know) and my brother straight up just asked me what I was on. We had an hour long frank conversation where he told me he thought I was an idiot for thinking I could keep this from him (and he agreed not to tell our parents) and I agreed to go to detox at the hospital (we live in Canada so, free). 

I don’t want to talk about what the detox was like as I’m sure people can imagine and others who have gone through it can explain it better than me, but yeah, it wasn’t fun. 

Anyways, this was two months ago. I have been clean since then and I am on a waiting list to see a therapist. 

I didn’t tell him about the money for sex, and he didn’t ask me how I was getting all the money. I have been having problems with the more sketchy people I had coming around bothering me after I cut contact with them, but honestly there isn’t really much I can do about it. 

People will probably call me an idiot for this and I know I am being an idiot, but I still haven’t gotten tested for anything yet, not HIV or anything. It’s not that I can’t, it’s that I’m scared to death. The men who I slept with for money, some of them were super sketchy and were sick with who knows what. But I didn’t care back then. 

Either way, I haven’t gone to get tested, even though I know I’m being stupid. 

Just thought I’d throw this update out there. 

Tl;dr: Talked to my brother, did detox, still haven’t gotten STI checked.

relationships,I [22F] need advice getting over this unhealthy crush on my coworker [20sM],"Hello everyone. So I've had this crush on my coworker for a few months now, and it's really not good. We only see eachother in passing, and he's only talked to me once about something work related. Even though we don't talk, we do look at each other sometimes, so we notice each other's existence. He's very outgoing and friendly with other people on my team. He's also very attractive. I enjoy being around him, but I'm way too nervous to talk to him. Honestly, I basically just admire him from afar. I'm not interested in a relationship with anyone right now, partially because I need therapy to heal from past relationships first, so I'm definitely not trying to be together with him. I just like him.

This wouldn't be so bad, except it's become unhealthy for me. Whenever he's around, I get so overwhelmed that it's difficult to concentrate on my work. Sometimes I have to walk away and take deep breaths to calm down. I just get so nervous and preoccupied with my thoughts. I realize this sounds ridiculous, it is. I also can't stop thinking about him. It seems like I spend the entire day looking forward to seeing him, then once he's gone I feel empty and sad. I recognize this is really unhealthy and potentially creepy.

I work with some good friends and I genuinely enjoy their company, I also like my job a lot so it's not that work is boring without him. I'm actually a very talkative and happy person with everyone else. I really want to get over these feelings because they're useless and only hurting me. To be honest, this isn't the first co-worker I've felt this way about. At my last job, I also had a crush on my manager and it was on the same unhealthy level. So I feel like becoming fixated on people is reoccuring problem, and I really would like to know how I can change this pattern.

I welcome your honest thoughts on this situation.

TL;DR: I have a coworker that I really like, even though we never talk, and it's become an unhealthy crush because I get so overwhelmed when he is around that it's interfering with my job. I already accept that we won't (and shouldn't) be together. I just need advice on getting over him and changing whatever is causing me to feel this way.

EDIT: I seriously can't believe how many people have responded to my post. Every single comment has something very relevant and beneficial to say, and you all have given me a lot of insight about my feelings and ways to cope. All of your compassionate and understanding words are helping me tremendously. I'm sincerely thankful for all of your responses. I will take your suggestions to heart, and as some of you advised I'll bring this up during therapy when I get the chance to go. I will take some time to reply to individual posts soon, but please know I'm reading all of them and am truly grateful for your input. Also, that so many of you can relate to having unhealthy crushes makes me both happy and sad. It feels good to know I'm not alone, although I wish the best for all of us, that we can move on and find fulfillment in our lives. Thank you all so much.","Well done acknowledging that this crush isn't a positive thing for you right now. You said that you need therapy for something else right now, so why not bring this crush up as an issue as well? The two things may be more related than you think, so working on these two issues concurrently with your counsellor (the crush and your other relationships) could actually help you get to the root of your issue quicker.",2272,75,2019-10-05 11:58:11,ddmbaj
relationships,UPDATE: My (22F) strict family ruins my life and i don't know what to do,"[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/d4sm1v/my_22f_strict_family_ruins_my_life_and_i_dont/) is the original post, for anyone interested

&#x200B;

First of all,  i'ld like to thank everyone who tried to help and advice me in my original post. You guys really opened my eyes and gave me the strength to change my life.

&#x200B;

So i was able to see my college's psychologist, even though it took me alot of time to get an appointment because i didn't have a phone. I explained them the situation and they immediately took things seriously. I was also able to see a social worker who helped me get a residence room. So i moved out last Wednesday. Unfortunalety, my familly ended up findng me the day i moved out. No need to explain how terrible that day was. So i'll have to move out again very soon which is good. 

&#x200B;

Im not gonna lie, im completely terrified now that im just by myself. I feel so alone and scared because  i don't have a home, nor anyone i can count on blindly, you know. Like someone who got my back when i need to. I've always been that type of person who's always on their guard. Now its even worse, and the fact that my family knows where i currently live doesn't help at all. I only go out when i really need to. But i know its just a phase  and it will pass. I just need to get used to this new life. 

&#x200B;

You guys really changed my life and im more than thankful and grateful for that!

&#x200B;

 TL;DR: Finally got myself away from my toxic family.","Congrats OP, you made the first big step to getting control over your life! I know this is all scary and your right it will pass. Take some time to make a list of goals for the next few months. Getting copies of all your legal documents if you didn't have a chance to get them. Open your own bank account, start looking for a job, ect. I don't know about you but the fear of doing adult things went away for me when I just pushed myself to do it. And don't be afraid to ask people for help, look into whatever resources you can. You got this!",2238,79,2019-12-09 14:17:35,e8ai4h
relationships,[UPDATE] I [30F] still can't decide if I want to end my 12 year relationship with my spouse [45M],"EDIT: getting lots of messages telling me that I’m a piece of shit/horrible woman/selfish etc. Those are all the same thoughts I had about myself and sometimes still do. But that’s not a reason to stay with someone. 

original post [here](https://ud.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/cnfse9/i_30f_still_cant_decide_if_i_want_to_end_my_12/)

So, I did it. I left him. After really considering what everyone had to say, and talking to my therapist, friends, family, him, an extremely kind redditor who has spent many many hours listening to me and giving me advice, (even still to this day), and yes, even my crush... I just realized that I couldn't spend any more time questioning things, wondering what else was out there. I had to give myself a chance to have the life I really want.


It's been about 2 months now. We are still living together because we own the home, though I am only sleeping here 3 or so nights per week. We are completely civil with each other. He will be buying me out of the house, for less than I'd get if we sold it, but I don't want to go through the hassle of selling/make him have to uproot his life as well. I'm interviewing for some jobs so I can increase my income and afford to purchase a condo on my own, eventually. There's no time table for when I have to leave, I can take my time since I also own this house. I've been staying in the guest room the nights I am here.


I have also been dating my crush, and honestly it is going so well. He's more than a crush at this point, I feel incredibly guilty saying this but I am happier then I have been in a very very long time. Being with someone my own age is really different, and being with someone who really wants to experience life in the same way that I do is blissful. He is so outgoing and social, and just everything we do together is so much fun. I have done more with him in the past 2 months than I have done in the past 10 years, in all honesty. We have gone to a wine tasting, a beer festival, some town events, a few restaurants, gone on hikes with and without my dog, watched the sunset by the river, many many bars with and without friends, bbqs, birthday parties, gone out shopping, danced together in his living room, had a fire in the backyard while drinking wine, and the list goes on. This weekend we are going out of town to visit one of my friends and her boyfriend - a double date night. He bought us tickets to a concert for one of my favorite bands in November and we are making a weekend of it. We cook together, he cooks for me, I cook for him, we go to the gym together (I had never really gone before but he is really into fitness so he's been training me)... And on top of all of that, the sex is fucking mind blowing. We want the same things for our futures, and he encourages me that I can make more of myself than what I have so far. We just have such a great time together.


I have also been spending time reconnecting with friends of my own, and it feels amazing to have female friendships again. I literally didn't have that for over a decade. I went out of state one weekend with one friend, and we just talked the whole time about everything you could imagine. We laughed, we cried, we gave each other advice, we shared things with each other. It was just really fulfilling! I can't believe everything I have been missing out on... even just friendships like this. I was so isolated.


I feel like an awful person still for leaving such a long relationship, especially since it took another man to open my eyes to how unhappy I really was. But looking back, I was so unhappy for so long, and I just didn't understand why. And now it's much more clear. My ex is a good person and I still don't know how I feel about the age difference, but I do know that it broke my heart to break his. It really did. I still cry about it sometimes, not because I question my choice... but because I don't. I'm excited to move out, I'm excited to get my own place and focus on my career and myself, the way I should have done years ago... And that really rips me up. Spend 12 years with someone and suddenly you just want to go. He didn't deserve this. It's very difficult for me to be around him because I just feel so terrible, even though he tells me it's ok and he has made his peace with it.


I just thought I'd update. There's still a long road ahead in all of this, but I feel like I'm on the right path. Life is exciting and unpredictable again. For so long, every day was the same, and what I wanted was irrelevant.


TL;DR - I left him. I am incredibly happy, and while I do feel really guilty about that, I am not wavering in my choice. Thanks to everyone who told me to put myself first for a change.","I'm going to throw a word of caution out there, not as a hater, but as a realist. That crush you have and the bliss you feel right now could simply be New Relationship Energy. I'm not saying leaving your other relationship was the wrong idea, but I'm cautioning against comparing that one and this one as a predictor of how successful your new relationship will be. At this point it's simply new, and that brings with it a certain excitement and stimulation. At some point it may become routine as well and fall into a pattern, it's when that happens that you'll be able to test if it has legs. Part of that will be how YOU behave differently than in you did in your former relationship, not necessarily what your new partner does (although that's important too).

I'm in my 40's dating someone who's more than a decade younger. While it's scary to think what would happen if she left me it wouldn't be the end of the world. I'm my own person, I'll survive. Hopefully your ex will find that for himself as well. We have to learn how to be whole people alone. We have to have separate interests and experiences and have our joint interests and experiences be a bonus not a requirement.",2168,46,2019-10-18 00:30:47,djffbx
relationships,UPDATE: How do I (23F) become a better partner?,"Original post here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/d399xs/how\_do\_i\_23f\_become\_a\_better\_partner/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/d399xs/how_do_i_23f_become_a_better_partner/) 

 tl;dr: I've been a terrible partner and I want to be better at handling my emotions 

I greatly appreciate everyone's response to my previous post. I took everyone's advice and have tried to incorporate them as best as possible in the last week or so. I talked to my partner and I apologized to him for my behavior. I went to therapy last Saturday and it helped quite a bit, too. I'm not great at face to face conversations so I sobbed the entire time. I've only cried like this in front of him once so this was surprising to him. It was my birthday this past Monday so I am actually 24 now! We had a really great weekend away. There have been times this past week where I've found myself getting irritated or upset for no good reason so I took a few redditors' advice and I've started taking notes on my phone of what I'm feeling. It has helped me stay calm when I'm expressing my thoughts and emotions. I know I have a long road ahead of me and I'm so thankful for everyone's advice.",Keep up the good work!

relationships,I (27M) feel terrible & depressed because my girlfriend of 3.5 years (26F) can't perform sexually due to a health condition and doesn't value physical intimacy. What can I do?,"This is an odd one. I've been with her for 3.5 years, though most of it long distance, so our time together was limited to a couple months each year. Recently she finished school and moved across the country to be with me, before she did I expressed my concerns that I didn't want to be the reason she'd move and that I can't promise we'd end up together. She moved anyways, we've been living together for about 6 months. Things have been going alright, but lurking problems with our sex life have come to the fore.

She has a health condition which limits her ability to move her hips and limits sensation - that's as specific as I'll get. Otherwise she's very active and lives a normal life. I'm her first sexual partner, but she is not my first. Sexual contact and quality time are how I best ""hear"" the affection of a partner, I've always been a sexual person. She is not asexual, but due to her condition she simply doesn't enjoy sex and never has - best case she has minimal sensation and worst case she starts to hurt. She isn't vocal, can almost never finish (even on her own alone-time, due to a lack of sensation), and doesn't see sex (or being physically intimate) as a big part of a relationship - I always have. I always have to initiate, and while she will reciprocate it almost always feels somewhat forced on her part, like a chore, which leaves me feeling utterly terrible. I've communicated my concern about our sexual incompatibility, several times over the past 3.5 years, and she's always said she will try. My problem is that I'm not sure there's anything to ""try"". I don't want her to have to ""try"". I've tried to get her to open up, to relax and accept herself and be more sexually free, but when there isn't sensation it's just a nonstarter for her, which also means she almost never initiates anything and there's never any romantic interactions outside of the of when we're intimate - it's not how she thinks.

My mind has begun to wander. I remember previous sexual partners and I miss feeling physically wanted and satisfied, I miss having an actively participating partner. I miss the feeling of being able to satisfy my parter, and the intimacy that a good sex life brings into a relationship. I cheated on a partner of mine in the past, immediately came forward with it, and felt terrible - I swore on my life I'd never do that again to someone I love. I'm going to seek professional help but the waitlist for therapy at my University is at least a month, and frankly the therapist is terrible. I'm stuck in a shitty cycle of 1) feeling like I deserve a sexually compatible partner, 2) degrading myself for labeling my girlfriend (in my head) as sexually incompatible with me despite all her efforts and her condition, 3) reconciling with the fact that she has a medical condition and doesn't really have any control over the situation, and 4) trying to understand how to make things work or if that's even an option.

She is a possessive, so extra partners is not an option - and frankly not what I want. I want intimacy with my partner. Her mind has always been on marriage, but I don't see how any marriage can work without intimacy and satisfaction for both partners. What can I do when we've already talked this out and tried to address it for years long-distance, and now months of living together? Do I just squash the part of myself that wants to give and receive intimacy? Am I wrong for thinking that is a requirement of a healthy relationship? Are there other things we can do? I feel like she has no choice due to her condition. I refuse to cheat. The idea of leaving her for something that appears so shallow, when we have an otherwise good relationship, ruins me and will ruin her.

Thanks for the help...

&#x200B;

TL;DR! Girlfriend has a health condition that makes it so she can't really move her hips and doesn't feel much sexually - and her personality understandably does not weigh prioritize physical intimacy. I am very physical and always have to initiate intimacy - 3.5 years on it feels like I am a sexual chore to her - though she will never admit to it. We've always talked openly about trying to fix this, but nothing has worked. I miss the feeling of intimacy that comes with a compatible sexual partner and it's making me doubt an otherwise solid relationship.   


Edit: Just nipping any comments now in the bud that suggest trying to spice things up in the bedroom. We've tried everything you can think of. The reality is that when your partner doesn't feel sexual pleasure that doesn't give you much to work off of. Open to creative suggestions, but just putting that out there.","You don’t need to justify leaving if that’s what you want to do. I wouldn’t stay in that relationship either. 

However, if you did want to try to make it work, you could try helping her find sexual pleasure outside of sex. It sounds like her condition affects her pelvic area but not necessarily other sensitive areas such as breasts, neck, shoulders, etc. You say you’ve tried spicing it up, but I’m not sure what all that entails. It sounds like you’ve focused on penetrative sex specifically which isn’t going to be helpful, no matter the amount of spice, if that’s not what feels good for your partner. 

But again, this isn’t something you’re obligated to keep trying. It’s okay to recognize your sexual incompatibility and call it a day if that’s what you want to do.",2139,192,2019-11-10 13:11:09,dub8ub
relationships,[UPDATE] Is he (m31) irational or am I (f27) not empathetic enough?,"[Original post](https://ud.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9ovs9s/is_he_m31_irational_or_am_i_f27_not_empathetic/)

Sorry for long wall of text. I guess I just need to put it out there...

We didn't broke up right after I made my post. We had a long conversation, made effort to listen to each other and decided to stay together. We right then planned to move in back together around New Years if everything's ok between us. And everything was good for a month, really good. At the end of November I finally relaxed, we started getting really close to each other again. One night he was extremely affectionate, we fooled around a bit for the first time after three months and later I mentioned moving in. After I told him how I think it's natural next step for us, I asked what are his thoughts. In a really cold manner he held 10 min long monologue how he's good where he is and there's no real reason to move back. I was sad but calm and just accepted what he was saying despite knowing that wasn't what we agreed on. He didn't really understand why am I sad but he let it go after I pleaded him. In short, he promised he will think about it.


Then there was a week long string of his shitty behavior where all of a sudden I was guilty for every little thing. In short, the biggest thing was: I asked him, though nervously, if I can give him my house keys in the town center so I can spend morning with family that arrived for a day instead of waiting him at home til he arrives with his stuff in the early afternoon (he lost his keys to my place); he agreed moths ago that he will there with me, on that date, when my cousins arrive. He could have come over day earlier but first he said he had to work, then when he didn't he said he would rather spend the day at his place and town. It really pissed him off when I asked that... He was irritable whole week after that, acting cold and distant and refused to come to my place as agreed on multiple occasions.


Finally we agreed he will come on Friday (a week after our last talk about moving in). He called me Friday morning, I couldn't really talk so we just exchanged few words (have a nice day etc.). Few minutes later I got text how I am cold and he feels unwelcome every time he needs to come over, how I ruin everything. I responded that if he doesn't want to come or be with me, it's okay, but I am not the problem and I don't want to fight. He is welcome to come if he solves his anger. He called me again and said he had enough and said he will just come over to gather his things. I was really pissed off because this was happening all over again and after 10 of his break up threats during our conversation - I told him I am fine with it. It ended up with him calling me a 100 times that day, I guess he was in disbelief that I (!) decided to break up after a whole month together where everything was good between us. I answered every call hoping he would say the right things but he was angry because his apologies weren't enough, mocking me and saying how he has no problem finding other women, how he was willing to forgive me all my wrongs and how I should do the same for his. At this point apologies meant nothing to me and I was annoyed how easily he would like to let all (his) drama go. Every few days he continued contacting me proclaiming his love etc., claiming he would do everything for me and us and how he changed, how he will always wait for me. He calmed down after a month, I was drawn to it so began calling once a week to see how he is. In February, after 2 or 3 conversations of that type, when I asked why is he willing to wait for me but not willing to actually do something to prove his change, he coldly said if what he already did isn't enough, it can't be helped. He was playing with me all over again and it was a final confirmation for me. He still tried to contact me after, confused how I stopped reaching out but I am not calling, not texting, not answering him for two months now. I truly loved him once but was miserable with him. I am now much happier and much much calmer, filled my life with hobbies, friends and happy thoughts! I am really proud that he didn't manage to convince me to lower my standards even more and destroyed my self esteem. I am tired of drama but I have never been in better state, both emotionally and physically!

tldr He was playing with me again, hot'n cold, I broke up with him, disappointed how he really turned up to be, feeling pretty good.

Edit: 
Dear Redditors,

thank you all for your support, it means the world to me in these moments! It feels good not to be alone.


Lots of you are guessing what was it with him: for months I was trying to figure why was he doing some things and, as some of you suggested, I noticed certain things were present form the beginning of our relationship – I was communicating back then I wasn't comfortable with it but he created a mental fog (great term!) about it,  I was more naive or understanding or just in love and accepted that change is a process that will take time. 
Those examples I provided you with are just the end of our relationship: yes, I was dismissive because I was sick of the pattern. Maybe I am not the best communicator, I see that now but I was really trying to listen. He did start dating me because I was empathic, he claimed it's my biggest quality. Later he claimed I disappointed him and that he expected more. His psychologist said he has just one problem: accepting things as they are when he excepted way more. He never had any problems he would talk to me about – except those where I was the problem. When I would approach him with my problems or how my day went, he would be smothered by it saying I must get used to people being unprofessional and not to be bothered by it (though not always); later he would point out how he always listens to me and expected me to be grateful he put up with it. 


Also, when I broke up with him – he moved to the city where I live in a matter of 10 days claiming that it was his wish to move there all along and how life in his hometown is hopeless – and how it could have been with me if I haven't broke up with him (that was just 15 days after our moving in talk). He also mentioned it was part of the plan he made with his parents long time ago – when I asked how I wasn't aware of it he responded, confused, that I have nothing to do with it and his and their living arrangement. While we were living together he would attack my choice of words for his birth home – if I asked how was it at „house“ (in my language used the same as home), he would say how dare I use house instead of home – when I would defend saying I didn't mean to hurt him and that I am not that conscious about my wording, he would be convinced I am doing it on purpose just to provoke him, emphasizing that his birth house will always be his home – and he wouldn't let go easily. Usually it would last for 3 hours - 3 hours of reasoning and convincing. Some months I was just numb sitting waiting for him to stop, not even trying anymore, my mind couldn't process it.


I think he was very insecure, out of his comfort zone and trying to find a way to move away from me, he became suspicious about everything I did or said, looking for a reason to argue. I figured he didn't want to be with me. We were incompatible in many ways and in the end I just didn't want to be closed in his box together with him anymore. I want to live. Freely.



What did help me? I learned that not everyone will react to my statements / words like I am hurting them. Now I still sometimes expect the worst and I can be really anxious about what I said (even though objectively it's not a big deal) but then the other person reacts positively, acknowledging me and my thoughts – and it's magnificent!


Thank you one more time - I can't describe what it means to me.","I’m so glad you chose yourself over this douchebag.

I was in a relationship like that once and he turned out to be an abuser putting me into a mental fog so I couldn’t recognize it

relationships,UPDATE: I [31F] am having trouble trying to decide whether I should feel guilty about not wanting to take vacation time for my mother [62F],"[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/e966ad/i_31f_am_having_trouble_trying_to_decide_whether/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

Edit: thank you to everyone for your responses - the good, bad, and in between. I didn’t expect this post to receive much attention at all, so I’m blown away. As we go into 2020, I wish you all the best in navigating and relationships in your life that need a little bit of TLC. I can’t promise responses to all, but will do my best. 

TL;DR: I devoted my entire therapy session last weekend to discussing my mom. Trying to set healthy boundaries. She got engaged on Christmas and hasn’t told me yet. Guess it really is a one way street. I don’t feel guilty about not wanting to spend time with her.  

Although there wasn’t a clamor for an update, I wanted to let those that commented know I did indeed discuss with my therapist on the 21st, and it was a doozy of a session. She told me it sounded like a one-way street in terms of my mom never being the one to contact me, I’ve always been her emotional support, and I cared so much but wasn’t getting anything in return. 

In fact, she recommended I start defining healthy boundaries immediately, but I decided that Christmas would be the worst time to start testing those waters. So I compromised with myself and sent her a Merry Christmas text, which she reciprocated but didn’t attempt to continue the conversation. 

Whatever, right? I just let it go and thought that was that. 

Not exactly. I don’t get onto Facebook but keep a profile so she can still tag me in inane memes and status updates. She knows this, but I always have to remind her when she sullenly asks me why I didn’t like her last post. “But I’m your mooooommmmmm!”

I find out at 9pm on Christmas night that she’s engaged. But she didn’t tell me - nope, my stepmom texted me to ask about it, and I was floored. It sort of opened the floodgates and I went from “I don’t care about her contact” to “how could she care so little about me?” in seconds flat. 

It’s 3 days later and she still has yet to reach out to me about her engagement, but I did creep on her Facebook and she made a post about “being so happy her kids (my siblings) were there to see it”. To her knowledge, I’m still in the dark. Now, she DID send me a FB message/video about 2 hours ago, but I’m ignoring it and won’t be contacting her at all until she decides to text or call me about her life update. 

Basically, I no longer feel obligated to feel guilty for not going to see her. I clearly don’t rank high on her list of important people, and I’m not going to try to make that happen so she feels like a better mother.

relationships,"My (25F) mother (50sF) wants to ""help"" plan my wedding so she can ""live vicariously through me."" How do I handle this?","EDIT: Thank you all so much for the comments! I appreciate all the advice and suggestions!

Y'all are rad as hell.

I'm a rambler, but I'll try to keep it concise.

My partner (28M) and I want to be married, but we don't care much for the idea of having a wedding. We wanted to elope, but my mom has been telling me since I was sixteen (and had never even had a boyfriend) that she wanted to see me get married and she would basically never forgive me if I eloped. I do like the idea of my family being there to celebrate with us, but I hate the idea of spending money we don't have on this huge party just so that our relationship can change in nothing but name and legal benefits. And for various reasons, it doesn't make sense for us to wait until we can afford a wedding to get married.

We wanted to keep it small, preferably under $3,000 (which is honestly more than I'd like to spend, but we have to be realistic). We had planned on having it in my in-laws' backyard but even that was more money and effort than I was willing to put forth. I was stressed and feeling like I was out of options, so one day, I vented to my mom. She seemed really excited about the idea of helping me plan a wedding. It was kind of a red flag when she said, ""My mom didn't help me plan my wedding. Let me live vicariously through you."" But still, I agreed. She seemed really excited to help me find a venue. I was not excited, because I have not been excited about one single step in the wedding process and I just want it to be over. (Maybe it's supposed to be fun if you have money? IDK.)

About a week later, I found out that this really great park in our city (that my partner LOVES) does weddings for an extremely small fee. I emailed the event coordinator and found out that the date we want is available. I told my mom, and her reaction was, ""So I guess you don't need my help finding a place, then?"" And every time I talk about it, she says the same thing. She has always talked about how shitty it is to guilt trip someone, but I feel like that's exactly what she's trying to do.

I honestly can't tell whether or not I've done something wrong? Like, I'm not sure if I implied that I would only get married in a place she helped me find? I don't feel like trying to take action on my own wedding is that great of an offense, but I can tell she's upset. I want to make her feel better, but at the same time, I don't want to change our plans again just so that she can feel involved. Am I in the wrong? If I am, what should I do to make it better?

**TL;DR My mom wanted to help me plan my wedding, but I found a venue on my own before we could start. She seems upset about it. Was I in the wrong, and if so, how do I make it better?**","> ""So I guess you don't need my help finding a place, then?""

""That's right, not needed."" Keep confirming that you're set with that. If this doesn't work, perhaps have a conversation about what she exactly wanted from her mother and what she actually wants to offer you. Support is not the same as planning for others.

Is your mother married, btw? She can marry the same guy again if she is and plan her own wedding with her wishes. Vow renewals are pretty popular.",2124,109,2019-12-06 14:21:52,e6zd75
