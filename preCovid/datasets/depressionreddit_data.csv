depression,Shout out to the particular hell that is functional depression.,"This is me. Don’t get me wrong, it’s better than don’t-leave-my-bed-for-a-week depression. I am grateful I can be an independent person. But there is something uniquely horrible about being able to go to work every day, occasionally clean up after yourself, pay your bills, generally put yourself together enough to look like a human being... but that’s it. Nothing else. No social life. No hobbies. Constantly battling your mind. And being absolutely fucking exhausted all the time.","I know how you feel. I feel sad and hopeless most of the time, but I always manage to go to work. I guess as hard as it is when I wake up, once I’m there I feel somewhat better.",6676,197,2019-07-14 07:53:40,cd0hjp
depression,"If 10 years ago someone told me that in 10 years I would be routinely sitting in my room all day doing nothing to make myself a successful man but eat, sleep and use my phone/pc and sometimes go out for a lonely aimless walks, I would never believe them","But here I am, 24 years old man and doing exactly that.",[deleted],4420,125,2019-07-12 13:36:38,ccaxvm
depression,High-functioning depression: I feel like I'm living a double life.,"I read a lot of posts on here of people struggling with daily, debilitating depression that plagues every aspect of their lives, making it difficult to do small things like even take a shower. I feel that I am on the opposite side of the spectrum and wanted to share that it is equally as horrible.

From an outsider's perspective, I appear to be a very happy and stable individual. I have a financially secure job and I go to work every day and not only try my best but actively try to get along with others and make people laugh every day. My coworkers like me, and some look up to me. No one would think I have any problems at all. However, I feel like I am hidden behind a veil, and when I come home from work and when I am in the privacy of my home, I am in such crippling depression. I have such terrible episodes of sadness. I hate myself. I over-analyze everything stupid I do or say throughout the day and I replay it in my mind constantly and belittle myself. I don't feel proud of myself for any of my accomplishments and genuinely don't know why anyone even likes me. And yet I still get up every day, live this routine, and put on a facade like I am okay. It feels like I am living a double life that I cannot escape.","This would be called Persistent Depressive Disorder. I am not diagnosing you BUT I say look into it. This is exactly what I was diagnosed with along with C-PTSD. 

And it sucks because I feel like I’m not sick enough. Sure I may go days without showering and brushing my teeth. I have crying episodes and I self-harm. Suicidal ideations totally there. But I also go to school. Go out with friends. I have good grades and pass all my classes. And like you, I feel like I’m living a double life. 

There’s been this desire in me lately. One of just escaping. Either through death or through moving to another state. But there’s just this intense desire to get away. And I think that’s where it stems from. I won’t lie, I suffer from an identity crisis. I genuinely don’t know who I really am. I’ve spent my whole life conforming to everyone’s standards just to please them. 

Anyways OP, I hope you’re able to overcome this to whatever extent possible. We all deserve a chance at true happiness.",4089,200,2019-10-31 09:36:19,dpl4bu
depression,I cried in front of my family today. They ended up comparing their issues to mine and tell me that other people have it worse.,"Thank you, that really helps.

depression,Does anyone else stay up super late to avoid the next day?,"I don’t know if that makes sense. What I mean is that I stay up as late as possible wasting time because I know that if I go to sleep, I’ll wake up and have to go to school. I usually go to bed at around 3:30am and get up at 6am and it’s destroying me, I’ve been doing this for months and I’m physically weak and exhausted constantly because of it but my depression and anxiety demand it.

depression,My therapist died,"She was only 67. She told me every so often about how she always thought she'd end up with her ex husband again and how she thought they were meant to be together in the end, I don't know if she ever got the chance to tell him how she felt.

I'm extremely shaken up, but I think she wouldn't want me to be sad for her.

In her memory I'm going to tell the people I love how I feel, give my dog a hug, and remember that she is in my corner rooting for me when I feel like nobody else is.

Not qualified to diagnose this at all but I do recognize what you are saying(really motivated followed by a crash) in my pattern of moods and I have bipolar disorder type 2.

depression,Is anyone else strangely sick of being high functioning?,I know that the fact that I can brush my teeth and shower each day and show up to work each day is a blessing with my depression. But I’m also sick of constantly feeling like I’m about to break. I hate nearly downing my pills each night only to wake up the next day to plaster a fake as smile on my face and go to work. Each night I think to myself I can’t go on like this and each day I do. Part of me just somehow wishes I completely gave up and just hit rock bottom. I don’t know. Anyone else feel the same?,"Yes.

depression,Becoming a regular at a local coffee shop changed my life,"I was depressed, failing school, etc and I decided I should do my homework at a coffee shop one day. I went in and the owner was super nice and asked me if I wanted to join the rewards program and I was really craving community at this point and I was super excited. 
I kept coming back to the shop to do my homework and the owner and the baristas would always welcome me and they were always happy to see me. I started to get to know everybody there very well and now I consider them all friends. 
I found that when depressed having different communities helps a lot, and it turns out a lot of the other regulars at coffee shops also are depressed or have other mental illnesses. 
A two dollar drink can let you stay there for a few hours and by being nice to everyone around you and being somewhat productive on work it can be a really great place to have","This makes me happy. Sometimes it’s hard to find ways to get out of the house when you’re alone. Coffee shops are nice because you *can* be social, but you don’t have to be. 

I’ve been going to a local coffee shop sporadically over the past year, whether it’s to work on art or homework. I haven’t built any lasting connections, but it’s often one of my only ways to get out of my apartment. ",3455,82,2019-03-31 17:13:32,b7q1kc

depression,"2 years since I dropped out of college due to anxiety and depression, I finally signed back up for classes yesterday.","I finally did it guys!!!!! 2 years!! 

I was so depressed 2 years ago I started skipping classes, I failed every single class I was in. My GPA dropped to a 1.7. I lost my financial aid, which I couldn't go back the next semester without.

I spent the last 2 years, becoming more and more depressed because I couldn't afford to go back and I ruined my life over depression. 

But I finally did it!!!! (with the consistent encouragement of my boyfriend who told me hes going to keep on top of my ass and I'm not allowed to skip class) I still have a year and a half left for my associate's because of how much I failed but it's a start.

depression,The worst part of depression is that it's stolen my personality,"My actual personality is over the top, fun(in my opinion), confident, and kind. But the depression teams up with social anxiety so that I just don't have enough enough energy to act like who I truly am. I turn into this very flat, monotone, boring, quiet person who I would never want to hang out with or date.

It's the main reason I avoid social interaction now - it feels humiliating because I feel like I'm perceived as this pathetic, pitiable, ignorable person.

 When I'm feeling better and have a little more energy I can act like myself but usually I'm just this shell. It's horrible, like watching the progression of ALS in a loved one; they just slowly fade away until there's nothing left of who they used to be. At least with physical illness or bipolar or whatever you have yourself, that fundamental spark of who you truly are, and you're able to show that and share that with others. I don't even have that privilege. 

Sorry if this comes off as arrogant or insensitive, this is just how I feel.

edit: Guys, thanks so much for all the responses. I appreciate all of you. I didn't know so many people felt the same way, and I'm glad if I was able to help give voice to your struggles. I've had depression my whole life so I've had a lot of time to think about these things. I think it helps to be able to really narrow down what you're feeling.

depression,"We only wish depression was being ""sad"".","But depression is much more than that. 

It’s the excuses you have to make when you can’t make that meeting. 

It’s the friends and family you’ve lost because you can’t explain why. 

It’s the opportunities that land in everyone else’s lap, that they get to grasp with both hands, while yours slip out of your grasp. 

It’s the exhaustion that binds your body to your bed. 

It’s the hatred and resentment you feel towards yourself, towards the world for being the way it is. 

It’s your proven truth that everything and everyone gets better, except for you. 

It’s the demon that dragged you down and trapped you in the hellish prison that is your own mind. 

It’s the ball and chain locked around your neck, choking the life out of you as you trudge through your marathon, while everyone else gets to charge on ahead, unimpeded. 

It’s the wall that blocked you off from life. 

It's the leech that sucked out everything positive about your life and clouds your memories.

depression,An unexpected side effect of depression: the decline of cognitive capabilities,"This has been really scaring me lately. Since becoming depressed I've noticed more and more;

- an inability to maintain thoughtful conversations with people

- severely reduced attention span

- short term memory loss

- severely reduced motivation

I think it largely has to do with my partaking in escapism, as I spend much more time browsing reddit/youtube and getting high since when I actually try to focus on work I usually end up crying. The result seems to be a feeling like I've been living in a haze, like I'm never really fully aware of what's going on, I'm just passively going through the motions of life. 

Getting out of this rut is going to be so much harder than I thought. I literally feel stupider now that I've been depressed for months. I can barely even talk to people in my classes now, they seem so competent and on top of things while I'm just an embarrassment who can barely form a coherent sentence.","Sadly I get this a great deal, and it drives me crazy, I am sorry your going through it as well. I used to be able to watch a TV show or movie and care about it, now I have to pause ever 15 or 30 minutes and wait, watching a show or film can take me all day, I just can't bring myself to give a shit about pretend. I loved to read, I read a book a week or more from 8 until 32 years old. For the next 4 years of depression I read 5 books. 

And in the last 2 years of recovery and therapy things have improved, but more in other ways, now its still only a book every 2 months, wildly different than most of my life. I never did social media at all before I got on Reddit less than 2 years ago, not of any kind. Reddit is different, I still don't do anything else, and I do like it here and the people I have met, but I do notice I am on here 3 to 6 hours every day. I feel like I am coasting intellectually on things I already learned, ideas I already formed, philosophy I already believed, and more than anything thoughts I have already thought. 

This is the thing that is most for me, I am articulate and well read enough, with enough evidence based and fully formed opinions, that I can appear intelligent in all likelihood forever. But that is not the point. Intellect is nothing if one does not grow, does not learn and change, does not reach. It is improving with therapy and such, but in truth it is quite slow. The memory, concentration and motivation issues are incredibly frustrating, it bothers me because I want it and am trying hard, yet redeveloping it is proving so difficult. I wish I had answers besides continuing to move forward and to keep trying things, keeping those that prove effective over time.

depression,"The reality of depression: Yesterday I was googling ""most effective suicide methods"". Today I feel fine.","This has probably happened hundreds of times in my lifetime. I'm 50 now, so obviously I haven't succumbed to depression yet. But the peaks and valleys are insane; I guess *I'm* insane.

depression,"My friend attempted suicide a couple days ago. My family is saying I will ""ruin Christmas"" if I spend time with her in the hospital on Christmas Eve instead of visiting them. What can I do?","A good friend of mine with whom I've been attending therapy for BPD overdosed a couple days ago. She survived and was transported unconscious to the hospital. She woke up but is unsurprisingly devastated. I want to be there as her support, she has a boyfriend but no family members who care about her and few friends. I had plans to see my family for Christmas but when this happened, it left me deeply depressed, particularly because another good friend of mine had committed suicide four years ago almost on the same day. To elaborate, I don't like spending Christmas with my family. I like them, but Christmas has always been more about chores and preparations than about quiet and peace. 

I thought I would spend Christmas by visiting my friend in the hospital. I don't want her to be alone, I know that if I were in her situation I would appreciate it if someone came to visit me. So I proposed this to my mother and brother, even the possibility that I would spend the afternoon with her and then go down to see them before dinner. However, their comments left gasping for air. They showed little empathy for my friend or me. My mother asked me if I had any ""normal"" friends. My brother told me that while it's ultimately my choice, I would be ruining Christmas by not coming down, or even by coming down just for dinner, that everyone would be disappointed in me and it would create arguments, implying I would be at fault for them. 

Here's the breakdown:  with my family, I risk being ostracized for weeks if not months if I don't go down there. However, I've felt more and more like they were less and less my family, while I've felt like my friends have shown more compassion and empathy for my depression and BPD than my family ever has - in fact, they've dismissed it as me ""not having enough social activity"", as ""not having enough will"", and have called my therapy ""a waste of time."" I feel like visiting my friend is the right thing to do, I know I will think of her the whole time I would be down at my family's, but I do not want to be ostrasized for months. I don't think I could handle it with my mental condition. 

Any and all thoughts are welcome. Thank you.","You should show that you care, and stay with her, she needs it now more than ever.

depression,"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it","We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",Understood and I apologise if I forget in the future and break it,2367,70,2019-10-29 14:52:02,doqwow

depression,I’m killing myself [update],"So most of you probably didn’t even see my post before, which is fine, obviously, but I just felt the need to put this update out for the ones who did. 3 days ago I was so close to taking my own life. I was going to jump off a bridge and end it all. I was drunk so it made matters only worse. As I sat there and thought to myself, a voice came in my head. This voice told me how this was the wrong thing to do, that I have so much more going for me, and I can’t lose my life over some girl. 

So here I am, 3 days later. The girl and i have discussed what our relationship is going to be like. We are on a break as this is a time for me to focus and make myself happy. My happiness can’t be dependent on another person. That is unhealthy. I’ve started seeing a counselor and just doing more & staying active. I know In the end I can conquer these demons.

I would just like to say thank you to all of you who reached out to me that night. I obviously didn’t respond, but knowing that a random stranger online cares enough about another stranger to make sure they’re okay, well that is special to me. Thank you once again, and I hope every one in this sub finds some sort of happiness in their life. We all deserve it. This is a disease just like diabetes, and you should not be ashamed of it.

depression,"Depression is the hot funny meme until you're not sleeping, not eating, and hoping you'll die in a car accident","I never understood why so many people see depression as something we can all joke about so fucking carelessly and casually. Like, it's funny and relatable to see tweets and memes about how much depression sucks but it really does so much harm than good, doesn't it? I can't understand how this is just so commonplace. 

I laugh at them. Theyre funny. I see myself in them. And then for hours and days upon days I lock myself in my car with a vague numbness, ditching class or calling off work to just... what, stare off into a void and roll around uncomfortably in my drivers seat in a shitty parking lot, chew through a pack of cigarettes, and just try to settle down suicidal compulsions. I stare in the rearview mirror and gastation bathrooms for forty minutes trying to make sense of who's looking back and why the sight of that person makes my stomach churn. 

I don't sleep for days on end until I collapse. I lose weight in 7 pound intervals. The thoughts of being a fuck-up and how bad I would beat the shit out of myself if I met myself on the street just stew any time Im beside myself. It's so funny! So quirky and relatable!

I had a psych prof who talked about the fact that although we are all going to die some day, it’s such an overwhelming thought that we have coping techniques and kind of denial around the idea of not existing (spirituality etc). I really see it now. People who are not depressed way overreact to hearing about it or talking about it. There’s a post here somewhere about some poor high school kid who tried to talk to his counselor about his depression and suicidal thoughts... and she called an ambulance immediately and got taken to hospital against his will. Got released, but it cost his parents $1000, NOT HELPFUL. I mean, we’re the ones with a diagnosed mental health issue and yet we have to deal with irrational stuff like this.

depression,I (attempted) suicide by crashing my car into a highway median at 200 km/h and walked out with a minor concussion. I feel like it's a sign I need to step up my action against depression. What are some things I can do to alleviate my depression?,"The title and this story may sound fake (New account to hopefully protect my identity), but I swear to you it could not be more real for me. I wanted to share this, I am not doing this for attention but merely to seek help. More questions will be asked at the end of my story.  As the title describes, a miracle has occurred given the severity and intent of the crash. The paramedics, police, doctors, nurses and my parents all gave me the most puzzled look of their lives when they asked how fast I was going, and I replied ""200 km/h"".

I have been depressed for 4 years now. Nothing has been working and my mental health has declined terribly. I have been on multiple medications, tried behavioural therapy such as cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), and even went a course of Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). First my motivation to do anything went down; I couldn't eat, do school work and most importantly, socialize. My social circle grew smaller as my depression grew bigger, after 4 years of suffering as well as other health conditions such as horrible eyesight (+10.00 in each eye with astigmatism), sleep apnea and anxiety, I figured life wasn't going to get any better and I decided to end my life.

I drove to the mountains where I decided I would find a large hill, go full speed down it and either turn into the median or drive off the road, ultimately killing myself. About 3 hours from my hometown I found the perfect hill, The road was steep, perfect for gaining speed to ensure a fatal crash. Without thinking too much (I would just talk myself out and not commit), I pulled a U-turn and drove to the hill which was about 5 minutes after that point. They say your life flashes before your eyes, mine played back to me for those 5 minutes. The most important people and influential moments of my life appeared before my eyes. They suddenly disappeared as I approached my chosen hill. My foot automatically floored the gas pedal, I placed my left foot behind the brake so I wouldn't back out. I raced down the hill, gaining more and more speed, by the time I reached the bottom, my car (which only has a speedometer for up to 200 km/h. I saw the road start to bend and I jerked my wheel into the opposite direction of the turn, slamming the front end of the car into the median. That was the last thing I remembered before waking up in my car, with tapping on the window from bystanders. All I could think to myself at that moment was ""wow, I so much of a failure I can't even kill myself"". A bystander described to the paramedics and police that I hit the median, did about 10 spins (no flips) and then continued to scrape median down the hill for another 250m. I got a glimpse of my car before I was taken away in an ambulance, it was completely destroyed. When I arrived to the hospital I was placed in the trauma room however, the doctor was incredibly surprised after seeing me sitting upright with consciousness after a 200 km/h car accident. He assessed me and ordered a full-body CT scan. The results came back clean, no bleeding, no broken bones and most importantly, no death. He then admitted me to the psychiatry ward (which I won't get into on this post but it was a nightmare!!!).

The everyone's surprise I was barely injured, walking away with a concussion with memory loss at most. This phrase really stuck in my mind because nearly every person I have talked to so far has said: ""It's a miracle you're alive"". I'm not religious, but I agree, it is a miracle I'm alive, and I""m not going to waste it. I'm begging for help because I know this community loves to help people when they reach out. I really want to try and beat my depression but I don't know how. I have tried CBT, I'm going BACK to ECT for another round of treatment and I'm on increased medication. I will be seeing counsellors and psychiatrists, however thanks to Canadian healthcare not until 2020 (which is one of the reasons I decided to end it, due to lack of resources).

If anyone out there has any tips on how to manage severe depression and anxiety please let me know. I'm still alive today despite the severity of the crash, and I believe it's a sign that I need to conquer this depression and do something great with my life. I am tired of laying at home, with no energy and no motivation, wasting away my life every day with my depression. I can personally say even those who are suiciding don't want to die, they merely just want to stop existing.

Please help with any advice you have, I'm begging for my life to change, please. I am trying my best to push past my depression and suicidal thinking so I can give life another try.

Here are a list of specific questions that would benefit a lot:

\-How do I keep up my motivation despite having no energy all the time?

\-How can I keep up or have more energy?

\-I'm thinking of going back to school for Nursing, my current position (lab tech) doesn't feel fulfilling and I'm looking for something more. Is nursing school a good idea or will that just make my life more stressful?)

\-What are some habits I could do to alleviate my depression

\-Any secret self-help/feel good tips?

\-How do I make more friends and build a better support network?

\-What do I tell to my friends who have noticed I just ""disappeared"" for a few days?

depression,I wanted to kill my self last night but instead I called an ambulance,"No real reason for posting I’m just proud of myself for making the choice I did.
Edit: this is not what I expected. Thank you to all these wonderful strangers for the support. In the real world, only my partner knows that I even have depression because I don’t want to stress people out. I’m honestly so overwhelmed. I thought I would answer some common questions in an edit, and I’ll slowly get to each comment as I can 😊. Firstly the cost- I’m an Aussie and I have private health insurance, which includes ambulance cover, so it cost me nothing. I can’t believe some people have to pay. I wouldn’t have called if I knew I did. Second - what happened after I called. I had my live in boyfriend with me, and they came in and asked me some questions (eg had I overdosed / self harmed etc.) I explained that I had accidentally missed a few days of my medication, and then had several extremely stressful incidents occur over the space of the days I forgot them. I called because I started to feel like I couldn’t trust my brain, and I had a plan I was worried I would act on when my partner left for work in the morning. I had also had a panic attack right before I called, which I had never had before and oh boy was that scary. So off I went. It was all very gentle and calm. I basically just needed someone to watch me while I waited it out / for my meds to kick in. I slept in a nice room, was allowed to keep my phone so I keep in touch with my partner. In the morning I was given my meds (I had remembered them the dish before). I had various meeting were they explained that they were happy I called, it was just a relapse, forgetting my meds didn’t help. I had a long meeting with a doctor where I went through everything (I was first diagnosed 5 years ago with PTSD and depression) and the difficulties I’ve had getting help. I had a good doctor for a while, but she moved. So they set me up with a new doctor with hours the work in my work schedule, and a new therapist, again that work in my work schedule (most psychs in my area that bulk bill don’t do after 9-5) (bulk bill = in Australia medical services and partially covered by our public health system (Medicare) is the doctor only charges what they cover, it’s referred to bulk billing. Basically it’s free (but covered by your tax dollars)) They also renewed my mental health care plan (my document a doctor gives that allows me to access the psyc services at little to no cost) which I hadn’t been able to renew as my new doctor couldn’t fit me in. Lastly I was put in touch with a community mental health program a few streets from me who have given me a case worker. I haven’t meet her yet, but basically she’ll contact me regularly to see if I’m ok, and can be the person to find me doctors and psychologists when I’m struggling too. I’ve nicknamed her my depression pa. Lastly they recommended I get my dosage upped a little bit. Then I was realised (it was about lunch time) and got sushi. They also rang my boyfriend a lot (plus me texting him a selfie every 30 minutes on his request) to keep him updated, and to run down my plan moving forward.",[deleted],1889,71,2019-05-21 06:18:26,br6vgb

depression,I'm tired of being everyone's therapist when no one will give me ten serious minutes of their time.,"I've had a bunch of stuff happen to me in the past month. I got appendicitis and surgery; still recovering. Accidentally twisted my ankle. I got a cold, which I'm still fighting. However, none of that seemed to be enough for people to give me a break from emotional labor; they demand it from me 24/7, practically. Not asking for advice, really just ranting. These are just a few examples.

I had my sister calling me talking about her boyfriend who just drinks all the time and does nothing, and she was complaining about how she hates where she works. I tell her to get rid of the man and get a job somewhere else. It wasn't as short as it sounds. I listened to her and gave her serious advice, though I know she won't take it because she never does. Instead of thanking me, no one ever does, she tells me that it's easy for me to tell her to just get another job because I don't have one and can just sit around and sleep. Well, thanks, I just love sitting around and thinking about my crappy life; it is a positive joy. We hadn't spoken until her son ended up in an issue and, of course, the family therapist (me) gets a text, asking me to talk to her son and try to get him to listen to ""reason"". I agree just because I know my nephew doesn't get good support from her. Come to find out, she's mad because he's dating some girl who has a kid already. I can't say it's great at his age, but he's also an adult, so I just told him to be careful, watch out for emotional abuse, and reminded him of his last relationship, which was like a copy of his mom's relationships; she doesn't realize he gets his bad examples from her. After talking to him, his mom texts me and is like, ""I'm getting off work in a few hours, I'll call and we can do a three-way call and talk to him."" Nowhere did she ASK me if this was okay, didn't ask if I was busy or anything, but as with most of my family, since I'm at home, I never have anything important to do, so they just tell me to do stuff instead of asking, like I'm a human being. I tell her I texted him and I was still recovering and needed to sleep. She didn't ask me what I was recovering from, if I was okay, nothing. Just said, ""Okay, night."" 

My niece had trouble at school and she's a lot like my sister, unable to let go of things. She's upset because some girl at school wants to fight her because my niece took her chair. A chair this girl wasn't using, mind you, but that was just sitting next to her. My niece calls me, upset and frantic over this because the girl won't let it go and went to the office and had my niece called out of class because the girl wanted an apology. My niece refused because she said she hadn't even done anything and she went to the principal, who told her that the girl is known for ""keeping things going"", so she wouldn't be bothered again, but my niece wouldn't get off the phone until I promised to stay up until she got out of school in case they call her into the office again and she wanted me to talk to them. A huge reason I don't have kids is so I don't have to deal with the stress of dealing with teachers and other parents, yet I have to be a parent to my niece because my sister won't be. Mind you, I had just come back from the doctor, had been hopped up on pain meds and wanted to do nothing, but sleep. I forced myself to stay awake, but thankfully, no one called.

Then, my sister calls me and is crying, telling me how much she wants her boyfriend to leave the house. So, I don't say anything and just let her talk. Finally, she's like, ""I just don't know what to do or how to get him out of my house."" I told her to call the police; she doesn't want to get him in any more trouble because he has a DUI because he drinks and drives. SHE allows him to drink and drive her car, because he doesn't have one and doesn't have a license. I won't even touch how stupid that is. So, I get frustrated with her and tell her that I keep telling her how to get rid of him and she never listens, so I don't know what she wants me to do. She acts like I offended her and is like, ""I just called to vent, can't I vent, sometimes?"" I tell her that she can, but I'm tired of getting calls almost every week about this man; I'm not her therapist or life coach or anything, I'm barely hanging on by a thread a lot of days and hearing about this situation distresses me because, even if I don't like her very much, I don't want to hear about anyone dealing with this type of stuff. Not to mention, her best friend was killed just a few months ago by her boyfriend who was abusive and drunk a lot... make him leave before he gets to that point. Anyway, she accuses me of making it about me and hangs up. Maybe I did make it about me, but I want people to understand that I am not a therapist and I cannot fix their issues and I'm not emotionally well enough to take on all this stuff. I'm not sure anyone is, tbh.

Finally, we come to today. My mother had to take me to the doctor because I couldn't get there on my own and need support to get there. We're talking about normal stuff, then she's like, ""Aren't you tired of just sitting at home and doing nothing? You really need to get out and get a life."" I don't ever like talking to my mom about my mental health because she acts like it's a phase that should have been over in my teens and she doesn't understand why I'm ""letting it bother me"" as an adult. I'd like to mention, she has horrible anxiety, as well, but she powers through it to work, at least, it still takes over her life. She also doesn't do much outside of the house and has no life, but when I point that out, she brings it back to me. Anyway, I tell her I just paid all the bills and since the bills got higher, I don't have money to have a life, even if I wanted to. So, then, she's like, ""If you get a job, you'd have more money."" I know this, but I have tried many times to hold a job; I cannot do it for more than a few days without having panic attacks and breakdowns, which either end up with me leaving or getting let go, which then leads me into a deep depression. She acts like I don't try and this is even with medicine and therapy. Sometimes, I'm sure the main reason none of this works is because I'm around my family, but I never tell them that because I don't want to deal with that fallout. At this point, I'm just tired of the conversation, so I don't respond. Then, she brings up how I need to get some friends, at least... says the woman who literally has one friend and who got upset at my aunt for going out without her, even though she never goes anywhere when she invites her. Heavy eyeroll. Anyway, I tell her that I've tried to have friends; it's not my fault they don't put effort in and either they end up not talking or I fade out because nothing is happening. She asks me why I don't hang out with the people I met last summer. The two girls I met last summer were nice, but one would rarely go out with us because she would rather stay in with her boyfriend, which left me and the other girl. We hung out a few times, but then she got a new trivia group and stopped texting me back, so I stopped texting her and let that fade out. This happens too often, so I stopped trying to make friends. I tell my mom that I don't talk to them anymore, and she's like, ""That's your problem, you don't try and cut people off so quickly."" I texted the second girl every day for a week; she wasn't working at the time and she was always posting snaps, so I knew she was available, I wasn't going to keep texting for no reason. I try to have boundaries and get crapped on for them. Unfortunately, I am not one of those people who will keep trying and trying and trying when I see things obviously aren't going along, anymore. She then goes into this long story about how she met her only friend and how they only talk like once a month, but they are still good friends and I need to be more ""realistic"" with friends. What good is a friend whom I only talk to for 10 minutes once a month and hang out with, maybe once every three months? If that works for her, great, but that's not ""getting a life"" or anything else. Plus, I have a history of getting friends and then I become the ""therapy friend"" and I fade away because all they ever do is come around to dump their problems on me and get advice, then I don't hear from them for months, when something else is going wrong. That's not friendship, to me. 

And go back to my mom and my aunt. My aunt is mad at my mom for ""checking up on her"" at her age and, of course, I get pulled into it because my mom is being childish and won't talk to my aunt, so I've been designated the go-between, but I never said I would be. They are 20+ years older than me, why am I even in this?

I don't know. I'm just tired of being everyone's therapist and mediator. I keep trying to explain how draining it is. They obviously see I have my own issues, but they continually pour their issues onto me, expect sincere, helpful, empathetic responses, but let me feel bad or need something and everyone is busy or doesn't answer their phones or I get ""advice"" that isn't helpful. My niece and nephew would probably talk, but I don't want to burden them with my issues; their mother does that to them enough, and they complain about it, to me, of course. What is it about me that makes everyone think I'm a therapist? Plus, none of them pay me for my services. That probably makes me more upset than anything; if I was a real therapist, I'd probably be rich off all these ""sessions"", lol.","...it is at times when I have been made to feel the least important due to external influences, that I am forced to turn inward and try to repair some of my own self-importance.

I've devoted so much energy towards living the life found in college brochures - tons of social/hobby clubs, going out to bars and trying to dance with people, attending lectures and keeping an eye out for local events (whether because I'm interested in the event itself or because I feel like going would make me seem more interesting) - and I hate all of it. I haven't met a single person I enjoy spending time with. Even my academics make me miserable. To top it all off, when someone detects I'm pretending to have fun and calls me fake or disrespects me it stings for months afterwards. Because we know that's what life mostly is for us: a choice between faking happiness/confidence or revealing just how negative/pained we are and repelling all these people who want to have a good time.","It freaks me out because I recall being miserable in college, unable to make lasting friends.

depression,"If isolation is bad, why does it feel so good?","Why do I feel even more inhuman when I'm with others?

I don't want to talk, I don't want to smile. I don't want one of my friends to listen. I'm sick and tired of speaking, of explaining.




Whenever I'm alone, I might have moments of sadness, but I also moments of joy.



When I'm with others, I forget what my thoughts are really about and it feels like I am caught to spend time with them.




I don't want people to occupy  me or make me happy.

I just want to be how I am. Angry, sad, tired. 


And just deal with my own thoughts without having to tell people how I feel and why I feel that way.





I don't even want help. Because everytime someone tries to help, it feels like they are forcing me into a certain behaviour that I don't want.



It's not that I see my depression as a disease or illness, I see it as a symptom for something deeper. For the fact that I simply don't want to be part of this society, be ""normal"", hang around with others. 


Meeting friends feels so pointless, so shallow. Like you are still suffering but you forget it for a few moments. I don't want to forget, because I actually think the suffering might wanna tell me something.




If your leg hurts because you broke it, you don't just swallow pills or hang around others and everything will be fine.



You have to see what's wrong and adjust it.
And right now, every form of human interaction feels like I'm doing a marathon with that leg...","Prolonged isolation will cause you to fear people even when they have your best intentions in mind. Your mind will see any sort of interaction as a threat and you'll go into the fight or flight response. Usually, flight is the preferred option, but if you find yourself picking fight in a situation where it's not needed, then you'll be in a whole new world of trouble. Think about how a stray or abandoned/abused dog is usually terrified when it's found, and it lashes out at the people trying to help it.

I’m not super happy and slightly frustrated over something? Friend says “why are you so snappy lately” or “what do you expect me to do”. Nothing. I just want some empathy since everything that happens in my life is going fucking wrong.

depression,"After three months of almost crippling depression, I finally had the courage to call and make an appointment with a therapist and I'm very proud of myself :)","I've been struggling with depression for about three months now. I've had severe depression, social anxiety and panic attacks in the past from 2016 to beginning of 2018, harmed myself and tried suicide a few times, but I started a treatment, took medications and got ""cured"". ~~I guess depression never leaves, right? We just learn how to deal with it and control it but it's probably never truly gone... that makes me terrified. But I might me wrong.~~ 

But now all of this feelings are coming back and I'm panicking. I have no motivation whatsoever to go to work (I'm arriving at least one hour late every single day), I cry every morning and every night, I'm becoming paranoid with my boyfriend and relationships in general, thinking no one would want to be with me 'cause I'm a failure, I get too anxious to reply to anyone, I'm feeling alone, abandoned, ugly, insecure, unworthy, stupid, weak...

I tried to create a to do list to get me occupied. Stop using the uber app to go to work when I can perfectly walk (it's just 2.7 kms - or about 1.6 miles), cook my own meals and stop ordering from an app or eating junk food, start exercising (my apartment building has a gym where I can use wherever I want), go to bed early, wake up in time, have breakfast before leaving the house, reply to all the messages I've been avoiding for months, start to be productive at work and stop scrolling through reddit, get out of my art block and start drawing again, post more things on my artistic social media so I can be more active, start applying for jobs (I don't get paid enough and hate my current job), finding a new apartment to stay (My roommate is my exe's cousin so its a bit... weird?). Just ""simple"" things I thought I could handle and that would make me feel way better with myself. But I can't. I literally can't. Every time I try to get out of bed in the morning I cry 'cause I simply can't. I walk in front of the gym and just want to cry, can't even step on it. Sometimes I can even put on my gym clothes. I turn on my computer I just want to die, my energy starts to drop drastically and its an exhausting task to read my emails and start working. I'm always procrastinating and pushing people away.

**I think the thing that's bothering me the most is that I can't achieve the simplest goals, and I'm failing even on the silliest things in day life**. **I don't have suicidal thoughts anymore, neither the urge to hurt myself, so sometimes I just feel like this might not be depression, it's just perhaps me not trying hard enough.** But either way I can't live like this anymore. I've been deeper before, but that doesn't mean my life is wonderful. It took me a few weeks to finally defeat my social anxiety and finally called the therapist. My appointment will be next friday.

I hate everyone around me, I hate society, I hate this world, myself and my existence. 

I can’t remember the last time I was honest with someone about the way I feel. If I stop acting like I’m ok and someone notices I’m not feeling well, I’ll just say that I’m tired or my head hurts or other shit like that.

depression,I really hate when people invalidate a depression diagnosis as someone being lazy and etc.,"""depression doesn't exist"" ""you just want to be special and quirky"" ""you stay in bed all day cause you're lazy"" ""most people diagnosed with depression don't even meet the diagnostic criteria"" ""why can't you just be happy?"" ""depression is just an excuse""

&#x200B;

I think I've heard it all at this point. Really if depression doesn't exist, is that why I lay in bed all day starving myself? If depression doesn't exist, is that why I leave the duty that is showering at weeks at a time? I didn't realize being smelly was special and quirky.  If depression doesn't exist, is that why I won't leave my house? Do you honestly think laziness is the reason I was reported as a missing person to the police? If depression doesn't exist, why do I cry when I glance at myself in the mirror. Why am I isolating myself from family and friends? Why did I cut into my wrists? Why did I abuse substances, if depression didn't exist?

&#x200B;

An open letter to all those people out there saying ""just be happy"". That's cute. You've probably had a comfortable life, with parents who loved you. Unlike me, whose relationship with my parents has always been toxic. My dad first invalidated my diagnosis at 16 by saying depression didn't exist. He also threatened to kick me out onto the streets, and then again 2 years after that when my anorexia got worse. He just keeps me around cause I have some leftover money from school and he wants it.

&#x200B;

I've come close to suicide a few times. Once when I was 16 and another time when I was 20. Recently it's been on mind, as I'm hitting new lows, but I don't think I could ever do it cause I'm just so in love with my boyfriend. Though, if he ever betrayed me who knows what I'd do.

In the meantime, if you're on mobile, please read the info and rules which are under ""Community Info"" on the menu when you're visiting the subreddit.  

I'd like to highlight the most common violations that create extra work for us.  Please use reddit's ""report"" function when you see anything like that.  The exact reasons are less important than the existence of a report, because that puts it in our modqueue where we will look at it first chance we get.  

*  Helpers inviting private contact as a first resort.  Nobody who's both well-meaning and knowledgeable should ever do this.  Please keep your conversations out in the public threads unless/until you've established a solid rapport, and preferably let the OP decide when it's time to go private.   

* ""I'm here to help"" posts.  These are specifically against the rules.  

* Posts that aren't directly relevant to personal experience of depression, the mental illness and/or aren't requests for support.  Everything we do here is based on our core belief that talking about depression is both important and difficult, so we need to be strict about keeping on-topic.  You don't need to have a clinical diagnosis of depression to post here, but, on the other hand, being diagnosed doesn't mean it's okay for you to talk about anything.  For example, depression is *not* loneliness, it's not low self-esteem, and it's not being sad or distressed for good reasons.  Those are all important and serious issues too, and they should be discussed, but this is not the place.  

**Edit:**  I wrote this in a comment reply below but I want to highlight it here:  We enforce the rules as leniently as possible in the case of people who have come here to get support, but strictly in the case of people who are here for any other reason. We think it makes sense to ask people who are giving help to police themselves, but we try to cut people in need of help as much slack as we can without allowing discussions that take focus away from others in need of support.

I feel that if you aren't us, it is really ingrained into our society to ignore us, except if we are going to hurt ourselves or others. Somehow I make it to work everyday often ignoring hygiene for a few days, but I make it. Then I get to listen to inane drivel of co-workers and peers talking about ridiculous nonfactual points supporting their categorically wrong viewpoints. I have to keep my mouth shut, or else I have everyone around me saying I'm wrong, and I am rarely wrong. Shuffle day to day, keeping control because of multiple medications, knowing that my life is meaningless, and insignificant in all aspects but stuck in a ridiculous juxtaposition of significant anxiety and fear of death, clinging to my mortal coil regardless of all costs.

How can we have the imagination and the sentience to express ourselves linguistically, design elaborate systems, develop fiction and everything in between, but that it traps us in a grip of everything terrible we can imagine. What a curse it is to be human, to know what we do, and yet to not know enough in order to calm ourselves in this ridiculously turbulent universe. Less than a speck of nothing, we exist without purpose, and continue without reason.

I am lost, depressed, fatigued, hurt, and yet I am still here. I don't have hope of being better. I live the day and make it to the next, and despite my pain, I will continue as long as I can.",1630,451,2019-02-05 18:43:37,anh7tv
depression,I almost feel like I should’ve killed myself a long time ago and now I’m just living out a life that wasn’t meant to happen?,"I feel like the majority of my life so far was a movie of events just happening all leading up to the final end to the movie of me killing myself.  I would just die and I would never have to get to this part of life; it would just happen like that. but now I feel like I missed that chance and my movie is still going but the rest of the movie wasn’t planned out because it should’ve ended with my death so the story is just improvised, and now i feel even more lost and unmotivated than before. (because in all honestly I feel like I tried so hard with school and activities and work etc as one final push before i would kill myself but then I never went through with it and now I’ve given up trying on work and stuff) I don’t know whether others feel this way, but maybe in another alternate reality I did kill myself at the right time and that’s why I feel so wrong because I didn’t. who knows",[removed],1626,93,2020-01-15 16:18:24,ep4bw6
depression,I no longer believe in the myth that any challenge can be overcome with hard work alone.,"I used to believe that if someone tried hard enough they could do anything, I no longer believe that. I think hard work, wit, the help of others, and luck can allow someone to succeed in their endeavors but not hard work alone. This was quite a blow to me. I'm trying to replace this myth with something else at the moment.",[deleted],1606,51,2019-08-03 11:36:55,clhszv
depression,If I knew what I know now I would've just killed myself when I was 14,"All this pain and suffering, hurting other people, wasting people's time, dragging myself through life just to be in the same place 8 years later. This fucking medicine doesn't help. Nothing helps. I'm just tired of it.","I did try to kill my myself when I was 14. I failed. If I knew then what I know now, I would’ve gone to college far from my parents, gotten treated for depression, and realized that my weight does not define my self-worth and confidence in spite of what my mother says.   

Now I’m 48 and content. I’m happiest when I’m helping  animals at the rescue shelter.  I’m probably an oddball to many but I don’t care.",1601,58,2019-12-17 20:50:58,ec1rel
depression,I never understood why the suicide rates went up during Christmas time... now I do.,"I've always had depression, for as long as I can remember. But this year it's getting a bit worse I might say. I'm kinda in a haze, it's all foggy, my brain feels like cotton, I'm numb and in pain. I'm here but at the same time I'm not, I'm not myself anymore. The depression is choking me, the anxiety is killing me. I don't want Christmas to come this year.   
I  have this feeling that I don't want to be here to celebrate Christmas this year. People are nagging me about what I want for Christmas... I have no answer, because I don't need or want anything and I don't want to be here to open them anyway. Whenever I get a present from someone, I just feel guilty. Because trashy people like me doesn't deserve it, I just feel like a burden for everyone around me. I'm a waste of space, waste of oxygen. The guilt of taking up space is getting worse by the minute.   
I've told most people in my family I don't want any presents this year. They don't know it's because of the guilt. I'm tired of all the guilt! Guilt for breathing, existing, for being stupid and just for being me.  
People around me has been decorating for Christmas these past few days, I haven't. I don't care and I don't see the point.  I don't want to celebrate Christmas this year. I see no point. No joy, no happiness, no... nothing.   
Now I understand why people kill themselves around Christmas. 

My lack of will to live is kinda scary. It's never been so deep and strong before. The fact that January is gonna be financially hell doesn't exactly make it better. I don't want to live to experience January. I can't, I can't afford it. I can't handle it! Oh here we fucking go again, my brain is getting on overdrive and running around again. Push it away, just push the thoughts away. Cut, bleed and shut off my brain.   
Merry fucking Christmas to me.","The first few weeks of January are absolute hell.

People are broke, forcing themselves into “resolutions” they don’t actually want to do, and it’s cold and dark all day, every day. Divorce and breakup rates are at the highest peak, following the stress of the holidays. Just an awful time for so many, and that’s not even counting those of us already suffering from depression.

I feel terrible for parents that feel like they have to give their kids a great Christmas to keep up with the Joneses, only to drive themselves off the deep end when it’s all said and done.",1607,58,2019-11-29 15:32:34,e3g6bw
depression,I hate it when people say “well occupy yourself” when you’re depressed.,"People often say to take your mind off depression, go do something. Play music, focus on school, etc. But the issue is that these are all just blank substitutes that comes crashing down. Just as alcohol is a temporary fix (although it is destructive), using music, exercise, etc is JUST as pointless. I work out and then I feel great and then afterwards, I remember my situation and my life and I feel depressed again. If it’s not resolved, NO amount of “substitutes” can help. All these activities are are just temporary bandages on a wound that can’t close.

Edit: wow I didn’t expect this to get so many likes. My first post with over 1k likes! I’m happy to know that so many of you can relate with me in this way.","Like the people that say “look at all the stuff you have, you should be grateful”",1601,93,2019-10-12 17:23:48,dgy2td

depression,"Sometimes while enjoying time with my friends, all of a sudden I get very down and feel like crap. Over basically nothing. How do I get over this?","It has happened more than once, usually I just try and get my mind off it and move on but sometimes it’s hard. 

What do you guys do?",It's kind of like you're actually have a good time for once but then suddenly your brain reminds you that your life is still generally shit.,1577,79,2019-06-15 11:53:10,c0wi1z
depression,"12 months ago, I tried to kill myself. 3 seconds, that’s how long the EMT says I was gone for.. My body is suddenly getting flashbacks to that moment and it hurts.","I took three bottles of various pills in my cupboard, downed a fifth of tequila, and put a pipe to my car’s exhaust into the driver’s side window and cried tears of joy that it was finally going to be over.

I passed out and woke up in the ambulance strapped to a gurney, confused, sobbing, and hysterical. My housemate got home early and found me. I was admitted into the ICU, spent my birthday, Christmas, New Years, etc in the psych ward for three months going through ECT.

All I can think of lately is not messing up this time. It hurts because I’m a perfectionist, and I couldn’t get it right.",What lead to the suicide attempt? I'm pretty desperate right now. My brain feels fried. I have to change my meds asap and I'm a bit worried about it. I don't want to gain weight.

depression,I don't feel like I have any genuine friendships or relationships with anyone anymore.,"I don't know if these are just symptoms of depression, but I feel so distant from people that I used to consider friends. They never come in contact with me and I can't bring myself to contact them either, and when I do, it's often just short lived conversations or I end up being left on read. My main circle of friends kind of broke off, and now they never seem to plan anything with me. I feel so alone, but at the same time, it feels so hard to talk to people or even get out and try to meet others. As for finding new friendships and relationships, I feel like I've met someone but I find it so hard to trust them and I feel so scared all the time that it's never going to work out or if they're even interested. I honestly feel like I'm not even a priority for them but I feel so guilty and self-absorbed for feeling this way. I don't know if I should tell them because it might make me feel clingy. I don't know what to do and I feel hopeless.

depression,I really wish I could kill myself before the new year so I don't have to deal with whatever misery 2020 is going to bring,"There have been like, at least three suicides on the tracks this month and I so very much want to be one of them...but as much as I want to commit suicide I don't want to commit murder, and it would kill my mom if I did it, so here I am facing another lonely worthless year. I'm so tired of this, I'm just so, so tired. I don't know why I'm posting, like I said I'm not going to do it, I won't do that to my mom...but I really wish this could be over.","December is an awful awful month, and if you complain about family then people shame you because at least you have one, right?

depression,The most depressing part about turning 30 is when you start thinking “this really is my life after all”,"When you’re 18, you can make mistakes. You have the time to fix them. They don’t define the rest of your life. You have a decade + to build a life for yourself. There is always that hope that one day, things might turn out well for you. There is excitement. Life is full of colour, but off in the distance you see a storm and road in greyscale.

Then you turn 30 and suddenly the road ahead that looked dark and stormy ahead of you IS the road you’re now walking down. And all you can see is darkness for the next 50 years of your life.  Nobody is coming to save you or bail you out. 

I would give anything to go back and do things over. But there is no reset button, you can’t start a new save file. All you can do is turn off the game.

For people in their late teens/early twenties - don’t waste a moment. Appreciate the time you are living in and the fact that you have several important years to work with. They disappear without warning and one day, it will hit you like a fucking dump truck in the chest that you have lost them forever.","That's me now and I'm 40. See things coming but do it anyway, have leaps of faith, put your trust in the wrong people, entrap yourself in poor decisions and spend the rest of your life looking in the rear view mirror.

depression,Does nostalgia bring up your depression?,"Whenever I think back to when I was younger and happy, I realise that my life is worse now and itl never be how it once was.

depression,Does anyone else feel like there is a fog in their head they can't get rid of?,"Maybe this has been talked about in other posts but i'm new to reddit and for once wanted to be transparent about my brain. 

Does anyone else feel like your head is a fog? or like your living a video game (controlling all the moments and decisions but not emotionally attached) The feeling of un-motivation, detachment and numbness has only gotten worse (i'm 21 now). I notice myself making poor decisions due to lack of caring and foresight (even though i know what the outcome will be) Sometimes even as far as not being able to think, as if my brain is just a static tv. 

(i say sometimes to all of this because i have moments of feeling 'normal', or even periods of time. But it always leads back to that same empty hole)

I feel like my brain is broken, like i've been missing out on how everyone else feels.","I used to be a person who is NEVER late from anything, good at school and overall had good focus. Now I can't focus at school. Ive been late a lot and missed classes. In fact I quit my studies. I just don't really care, but it just gives me more anxiety when I actually realize I'm late when it's really not part of who I am at all.",1544,79,2019-04-21 06:07:34,bflw7u
depression,This is not the life I imagined for myself,"I was bullied in elementary school, and I always used to tell myself that it's only temporary, that life will be good later, like in the movies. All I have to do is wait until I'm 16, I'm gonna have friends, have a girlfriend, go to the parties and gradually get into life as an adult.

I'm 27 now. No friends, no girlfriend, I lost my job recently due to a work injury... the life never really got better. I'm no longer being bullied by other kids, I'm being bullied by my own head. Every year is another wasteful, unfulfilling stepping-stone on the road to death.

It doesn't get better.","Yeah same. I'm 31 got bullied a lot in school, outside of school too. And after some light fb stalking, all the popular kids are still living the dream, great jobs, travelling, loads of friends. Agreed, not like the movies at all :(

depression,"I've been left out of everything, and someone actually cared.","So, basically, my school is crap.

Teachers don't care about me being left out or bullied half of my time here. I didn't think the students did, until today.

There was an odd number of girls today since one was off, and we had to go into pairs. Of course, none wanted to go with me and neither did any one of the boys. So, I sat at the side and said I was fine not doing it.

However, one of the boys asked why I couldn't go in a three with one of the girls' pairs (if you couldn't tell I'm female, and in my school girls and boys don't like to go together much), but all of them said ""no this is a paired activity""

So he actually got really mad and called them all assholes and said how he noticed how they all treat me like shit and asked if I wanted to go in his pair.

He got a detention (just at lunch break) for swearing in front of the teacher and multiple small children passing by, but it honestly warmed my heart so much and it showed me that maybe there is some good left in humanity, and that someone actually cares.

It was the first time I'd felt happy in a long time, to be honest.","What an absolute legend, this man. He deserves orange arrows. Serious note though, you're one lucky duck to have people looking out for you like that.",1542,26,2019-06-22 23:50:06,c3whma
depression,Do you ever feel like depression set you back a few years?,"I'm a sophomore in college right now and I am constantly surrounded by wise people... People who did things with their lives in high school and didn't waste it away crying, starving themselves, neglecting their work... They were able to partake in extracurriculars in spite of nervousness or not being nervous at all. They were able to accomplish things efficiently without attention or memory issues. They were able to make friends without poor social cues.

I had friends who manipulated me and threatened to commit suicide everyday, and even then I never had positive influences to help me. My parents were so busy with work that since my youth I was always alone at home. I have trouble having fun... I can't emotionally feel like a happy person, it's always forced. It doesn't come naturally to me so people didn't like people like me.

I'm too lazy to write this but basically I feel so bitter. I wish I did more so I could show off my potential but nope, I wasn't certain of myself ever. I'm trying to improve but my past latches onto me. ): Sigh.

Edit: I have something to add. First, I am very happy to see that some people can relate to at least the topic sentence of this post. We all feel like we were taken back by years because of some shitty stuff in my past. I also didn't get to finish writing this (because I hadn't the energy to finish) but there were moments where I stopped eating, showering, and brushing my teeth for very long periods of time. I also hid my feelings all the time. When people used to say, ""You don't understand!"" it would hurt so much because I really did in some way, or so I thought. I had speech therapy in middle school and general therapy in high school but I was never very honest because I was always afraid of the consequences. I feel a little bit of pride I guess saying this but I feel like I'm an example of someone who hid all their feelings and just wants it all, like all vomited and shat and sweated and cried out of me until I can remove it completely. Nowadays I struggle to even read sometimes, I just don;t have the strength, but I try.

I do say though writing this was therapeutic because I am severely overwhelmed saying this but thanks for reading.","I dunno if depression set me back or if I am just an aimless loser. I have had very little growth since high school, I didn't have a lot of growth before that.

Now I'm not looking for any praise because this is something that every adult should do, but I've literally been stuck as too lazy to even take the trash out to the curb except for like once a month. By no means was it a neckbeard den, but it was pretty gross.

I swept, mopped, folded all of my and the wife's laundry, and finally took down the Christmas tree (I know it's May...) amongst other stuff. I'm going to go do some yard work now!

depression,Why does depression and anxiety make it so fucking hard to tell if people actually like you?,Seriously- I can’t tell even if I’ve known them forever. Do they like me? Or are they just too nice to tell me how much they don’t. Today is a bad day and I’m just obsessing over everything.,"I believe the term is Distorted Thinking. It takes many forms, but one is making assumptions without evidence. In addition, depression makes you see things in a negative light. This can lead to mistrust of other people and yourself. You assume that others aren't sincere, and you don't see yourself as worthy of their friendship either. 

The best way I've found to deal with this is to look at the evidence I do have. Maybe I have an awkward conversation with someone that makes me think they must hate me on the inside. But then I think back to past interactions and remember that they helped me out last week without me asking, and that's stronger evidence that they like me rather than an awkward conversation meaning they hate me.",1414,54,2020-01-12 00:23:46,enfyh1

Waking up on Christmas morning, making eye contact with a boy I had a crush on during class, playing video games with my dad and winning the level. Everything feels so dulled and flat now, it makes me wonder what the point is. I’m spending money to go on holiday to beautiful places and barely enjoying it. The closest I get to joy is when I’m shitfaced drunk. 

Antidepressants sorta help but I don’t want to be taking them forever, plus the side effects are crappy. I guess I will have to settle for experiencing that childlike wonder and joy through my son, watching him do things for the first time.

I don't still have any friends from then now. Hell, I barely have any friends left from 5 years ago.

I'm just so sick of it. I thought I'd broken this cycle, but it's rearing it's head again. I'm being told to just make new friends, but what happens a couple of years from now when they get sick of me too and I'm right back here, wallowing in my own feelings of abandonment, isolation, not belonging, etc. all over again?

It just reinforces for me that I don't belong on this planet, that as soon as somebody knows the real me, our relationship (whatever it's nature) is on borrowed time. That I'm just going to be flitting like a pariah between groups I never quite seem to fit into, spending the rest of my life pursuing validation wherever the search takes me next, until finally, almost mercifully, it ends.

About two years ago I started isolating myself because I wanted to be alone. It turned into me wanting to see my friends again, but I just wanted to stay inside. I don't know if it's because I don't want to see anyone I knew and loved, or if I think they don't want to be around me anymore.

She had so many friends, she could actually read a book without being overwhelmed, she looked healthy  and prettier. Now I can’t even move out of bed. I just lie there waiting for someone to text me, but it rarely happens now because either people hate me now or I’ve pushed them away. I don’t even have the energy to pull out my laptop and watch Netflix now. My housemates don’t even notice when I don’t leave my room for a week. Even my mother said this depression is making her life a misery. I used to be so full of life, but that seems like an eternity away, such a distant memory now. It feels like I have no one now and I have no energy to even move, let alone do anything slightly productive.

First off, let me say that you’re not alone and I know you feel like you’ve pushed people away/have no-one to talk to, but that’s not true at all. There’s people who care and love you. YOU. Your depression does not define you; depressionless you is not the “old you”, it’s just you in a different situation to where you are currently. How we manage and survive these situations are what defines us, not the situation itself. I know a stranger messaging online is no substitute for hearing from a friend or family, but you CAN do this, you GET through this. It’s all about taking each day as it comes - there’s going to be good and bad days, that’s all part of being human. The main steps are to seek help - are you on medication for your depression? Have you thought about counselling or CBT? It’s so easy to get caught in the negative and to be overwhelmed. Any small steps you can take will have big impacts in your recovery, and there’s no harm in asking for help. Here if you ever need to chat.

I don't want to be sitting in my room alone doing nothing, but I'm too tired to be outside doing something. I'm just cycling between the same sites I check every couple minutes somehow expecting things to be different.

It's not easy, but works for me most of the time. Progression keeps me sane.

My mood is reflecting my poor sleep.

I don't know if it's SAD or if the light changes are screwing with my circadian rhythm, but I don't like it.

I think depression for me tends to be a very physical affair. Body pain, muscle tension, sleep disturbances. It always seems like this stuff comes first. My mood issues are more insidious. I'm generally pretty rational and emotionally reserved, and don't tend to feel emotions super strongly in one way or another. So it sneaks up on me..a slow, creeping apathy and anhedonia.

depression,Fuck all of this,"I'm stuck at home. I have nothing to do. I have no friends. I have no reason to go outside. All my family does is yell at me for the littlest things (especially my mother). My physical condition is worse than ever before. Every part of my body hurts. As soon as I start to break down or cry, I get yelled at even more. I feel like I'm isolated in a place that might as well be hell. I have nothing in my life that gives me even the tiniest bit of joy.

Edit: Thank you guys so much for all the kind words. And thank you to whoever gave this post gold. I feel comforted knowing that there are people out there that can relate to my struggles.

But nothing's changed. I still want to die and everything is still shitty.

The only person I ever loved and cared about stopped being my friend when I opened up about my mental health. Just completely abandoned me. Everything else in my life has been shitty but that has really been a kick in the guts. I keep reaching out, hoping she'll reply to me and be friendly one day. But on the rare occasion she replies it's ""I don't want to deal with you"", ""find someone else"", etc. I fucking have nobody else. Everything I've tried has failed. Getting nowhere I'm therapy.

Just imagine yourself not fitting into those sets of species. We all supposedly ""have a purpose"" to fill, but what if you don't fit that category? Where do we go from there?

In my situation, I personally think I am not fit for this world. I suffer with a major physical health issue and that constantly affects my mental health. Similarly, my emotional health is just as bad and it deteriorates my motivation to do anything. I have no one personal and close that can fully understand my situation. I lost the one person I loved deeply and now she is with someone else. There's nothing and no one left to live for.

Or seeing a building and wondering if the impact of jumping from it will be enough to kill them?
Do they just look at a tree with strong branches and think “what a nice tree that is” instead of which branch would be best to hang myself from?

How is it possible that some people just don’t want to die? Not to mention so many people who go through painful and expensive treatments just to stay alive.

depression,"I just went from not leaving my room for 3 years with the biggest fear of going outside, to wanting to solo travel again! In 3 days.","Hi I’m 21M and before this Friday morning, I had never traveled before in my entire life without my parents. No friends sitting in my room being depressed and lonely about how I’m getting further and further behind in life (still do) but I’ve improved myself so much in these 3 days.

I’ve eaten out for the first time, (like at a resturant), I been going to places I didn’t thought I could find, I’ve managed to use the city’s train to travel, didn’t think I could do that. I’ve gotten thoughts to wanna take pics on the places here like the view, but I’ve gotten thoughts saying it will look dumb but I’ve done it every time anyway!

I’ve been open to meet up with ppl, but I haven’t found anyone, and I’ve been giggling the entire time being here cause it’s so pretty and I just feel so free!

I lived in my own hotel room! Like wow. To me it’s just wow. I been continually saying to myself on my room “wow, just wow. Wow!!!” And freaked out cause I can’t believe I’m just doing this without LITTLE TO ANY ANXIETY!? Like hello?!

I ordered room service to eat, even tho I had anxiety about it! Of what he would think of me cause I’m alone in my room. But after going outside for 3h i needed a “social break” to get back the energy to go out. (Self love right?)

Now I’m at my hotel room and tomorrow I just gotta eat breakfast and then I go home. (By train btw! I never traveled this far, traveled at all rather without my parents and I TRAVELED ALONE CAUSE I HAVE NO FRIENDS!)

The clock is currently 9pm, I could go out and go to a club, cause I never been to a club but that feels too intimidating for me at this time. I don’t wanna operate in the night time with not knowing the streets etc. (I’m taking care of myself)

This is more progress I’ve done in a friday-Sunday trip then I’ve done in 3 years sitting on my room and only operating in my small city.

I’m so proud of myself!

Feels lonely tho so I kinda wanna cry, I’m imaging how awesome this trip would’ve been (even more awesome) if I had a friend or ultimately a boyfriend with me! (I’m gay)

I’m so proud of myself. I wanna cry right now cause I’m going home tomorrow,I thought I would never say this, but I can’t wait to travel again! Preferably with someone this time!

I know this sounds cringe and I can’t believe Ive done this. I’m so confused why I don’t have panic attacks and stuff! But if I can do it, you can do it too. It really isn’t that scary, when u have small “missions” all the time to think about. I gotta go to x to eat and I gotta go see y and I gotta go check what train I’m taking for tomorrow, etc. these small missions keeping me  busy.

I know that when I get home tomorrow, it’s back to normal and misery waiting for me. But this was, I gonna say it SUPER FUN! I haven’t had this much fun in sooo many years!

I feel alive.

depression,So I bought myself flowers today.,"No special occasion. I just had a tough day at work so I picked up a big bunch of tulips on the way home. Not the cheap ones either, but the lovely fresh perfectly blooming crisp and colorful kind. ""What's the big deal?"" you're probably thinking. The big deal is that there was a time in the not so distant past that the thought of ""treating myself"" to anything ""just because"" filled me with guilt, shame and self loathing. You don't deserve it. It's too good for you. You're not worth the time/effort/money. You are nothing and you have nothing to offer so you deserve nothing in return. 


So now I really appreciate any small act of kindness I afford myself. Yes, there are still days that I force myself to have a cold shower in the morning just because I hate it. I love cooking delicious food for other people, but I still sometimes eat instant noodles when I'm alone and having a bad day because it's a waste of time to cook just for me. But today I showed myself a little kindness. I acknowledged the fact that I work damn hard and I am great at my job. I have value and I am valued. Tulips are beautiful and so am I. I deserve to have beautiful things in my life because I am a badass bitch.


EDIT: Wow :) Thank you everybody. Honestly I didn't expect much of a response to this, I was just giving myself a little pat on the back for not being a dick to myself for once lol.

In that I’ve been able to identify what has made me so depressed growing up and I try to deal with it. I spend a lot of time using coping methods and trying my best. For a depressed person I manage to excel in life.

Currently dealing with the sting of a breakup. Went on vacation to Asia and Ex broke NC before my trip to wish me well after what I gather was him finding out the grass isn’t greener.

I’m on a dream vacation with my older sister and her child while we visit her fiancé. A lot of my depression is triggered from a childhood of being parentified and also unappreciated and invalidated.

My sister spent my formative years teasing me for liking Asian culture and is now jet setting to my fantasy destination because of romantic love. Wasn’t enough that I liked something or it meant something to me for her to care or treat me right. Nope. Only a man would make her culturally open and respect me and my interests.

I was livid. I had been journaling, using positive self talk, etc but all I could think is “wow, people only care about me when I can offer them something.”

Creative services, language skill, advice, emotional support,child care...if there isn’t a task or skill I can do people rarely give a fuck about me.

I didn’t want to share this, and told her I needed a moment to collect myself and she kept bothering me until I cried at a shrine. I told her why I was upset and she kept telling me to put it aside because “we’re on vacation”. I turned on my data to call my mom, she told me to pay a tour guide to take me places and hung up on me when I asked to be heard instead of throwing money at my feelings.

I literally just wanted someone to put themselves in my shoes for 2 seconds and be a broken-hearted 20 something who is the third wheel to a family and a newly wed couple, but is trying her fucking best.

I didn’t need to spend more money on experiences.
I didn’t need to pretend I wasn’t upset.

I just fucking wanted someone to walk in my very capable shoes for 30 seconds and realize the only thing I want is a little goddamn empathy.

My family rarely thanks me for things. They don’t care unless I’m in crisis or isolating. I’ve learned to ask for what I need but it doesn’t matter because unless I have extreme reactions they can’t be bothered to hear me.

I am happy for my sister. I truly am. But jfc I am planning and helping with her wedding in the midst of a serious breakup . Which she also teases me about and infantilizes my heartbreak.


Feelings don’t go away because you’re on vacation. Therapy taught me to deal with my shit, but unless I act in bad old ways my family doesn’t react.

I am more than a babysitter or a social media paparazzi. I’m part of this family too.

TL;DR depression reared it’s head on exotic vacation. Talking through issues got me yelled at...

Edit : Whoa...thanks for the gold. Didn’t really expect this but if you’re a depressed empathy like me
I know it’s hard and I know it’s lonely trying to do good while being profoundly depressed with people and their actions. Well get through it",[deleted],1059,36,2019-07-10 14:32:58,cbhfwy
depression,It's like I'm chronically lazy,"Whatever I do or tell myself, I'm too lazy to accomplish anything. Even if it's something I really enjoy or look forward to, I just can't finish it. Time escapes me. And then my parents come and yell at me for being lazy, and then I zone out of even longer, and the cycle repeats.

Will I ever be an efficient, useful human? I think not. I asked myself this 3 years ago. I have not improved. I have not changed. How does one change, when I can't make myself /do/ anything?","Yeah that is something I have battled with myself.
Finding the motivation to do things till completion. I do not enjoy or have the energy to do things that I do not want to do. I think that is an issue with high functioning depression. Usually it does get better and you are able to attach a reason that helps motivate you to see a task through to completion.
With academic and jobs in the past I had the mindset that:
 ""I will only be doing this for a year, it will suck for now but after a year I will be free and this will benefit me in the future"".
Thinking like that did help motivate me.",1044,33,2019-10-23 12:18:18,dlyghi
depression,idk if this is just me,"when i’m around my friends i feel like i want to be in their conversation i want to laugh and smile at their jokes and contribute with my own stories but i just can’t.  like i physically couldn’t even if i tried i always end up just sitting there looking at them listening and not contributing even though i so desperately want to. 

idk sorry","Relatable, I mostly keep my mouth shut around friends and just appreciate being included in the goings on.",1041,55,2019-10-01 13:09:38,dbt5ps
depression,I’m a 14 yr old white girl diagnosed by a psychologist with depression,"I feel like i can’t talk about it because of the «14 yr old white girls» meme...


EDIT: thank you guys so much for supporting me, and thank you for tellling me your stories, i feel less alone now, but and i hope happiness will one day come to you! (I’m bad at english sorry) But seriously, thank you!",I understand. I'm a 14 year old white girl who has a lot of stuff mentally wrong. I'm constantly told that it's fake or it's just dumb. I get it. But you need to find some real friends who know you aren't lying.,1040,110,2019-12-16 17:01:33,ebhs7s
depression,"I hate lying on bed all day, being unproductive........but it's the only thing I feel like doing......",,"Same. I laid in bed for about 4 hours just watching Bob Ross because I didn’t feel like doing anything else, but felt guilt-ridden because there’s plenty of housework that could be done. I’m also wasting my day off, even though all I want to do during the week is relax. ",1035,50,2019-01-21 17:34:59,aicfhz
depression,I'm 36 and stuck in years of misery. Depression is my self identity now and I don't know how to change it. Planet earth literally seems pointless and I dont' know how billions of people can just live these meaningless lives.,"I've had depression such a long time and I too feel like its too late to achieve anything meaningful with my life, or even become the most basic description of what most people would consider a moderately successful adult.   I'm 39 working this grocery store job that literally cannot advance anywhere and it barely covers the bills - but it does enough for me to live on my own which I'm grateful for - that is a success I guess.  But I'll be honest as well - the job is fucking miserable all day customer service orientated for snobby rich health-obsessed and trendy people. Being stuck at this job (its the best money I can find now) literally makes me want to kill myself when I leave a shift there.  I've got a manager right now who hates me and if you know what ""constructive discharge"" means that is what seems to be happening at work.

So anyway I recently got hurt at work and typing at and using a computer at home like this is about the only thing I've been able to do for about two weeks now to interact with anyone.  I can't drive very much while hurt like this so it really sucks like I can barely manage to make a trip to the store for some basic shit I need.  I have to get completely whacked on medication (which can be fun if you like it - but I don't like it when it is involuntary) to try to do anything physical around the house (like I HAD TO do this one thing or I'd get a fine) and even then it is just so painful and hard to move.  It will probably be this way another couple weeks but maybe I can heal faster, I don't know.  It seems like doctors where I am just will not prescribe pain medication anymore because there are too many people abusing it - so now I can't get some pain meds when I legit need them which just reminds me of another stupid aspect of our society failing.

I really don't see much point in my living at all when I am just going through the motions of life but I'm miserable.  I can get by financially (so far) but I don't want to just get by while I feel shitty and useless and unable to advance myself.  I hate it and there is no point to living this way - and theres several billion people living out this same lifestyle right now.  I don't know how so many people are ok with these pointless lives - I guess they are happy enough with that?  I am not ok with it at all.  Hurting my family is the only reason I am waiting or haven't already gone through with it.  We don't get along so great right now but I would still never want to hurt them in that way.

I gotta add, just to be honest and inclusive, that I have anxiety as bad as I have depression.  It's almost agoraphobic - like it is actually becoming a fear of leaving my house for the million things that could go wrong.  Being stuck here I am not happy but I guess I am safe.  I shouldn't have to live like this, no one should.

thanks",I'm in the same boat.  34.  Lost all my friends years ago.  Haven't been in a relationship in years.  Even the ones I had were toxic as hell and they ghosted me after a few months.  Pretty much done,1029,45,2019-09-06 02:46:50,d0askq
depression,Anyone else feel that their best days are passing in front of their eyes?,"I’m in my mid twenties and I feel all I do is sit around and mope. This is supposed to be the golden age of people’s lives? I’ve accepted that I am different than other people who know
How to live fully. But what if this is the period that it gets as good as it will ever be. It feels like I took this time by my hands and flushed it into the toilet. Like i am responsible for my sadness and there’s nothing I seem to be able to do about it

Edit: didn’t think this would get so much traction. Been going through every response and at least I don’t feel this away alone. Thank you so much for sharing. And thanks for the advice too. ",I’m 20 and I feel this. I just waste time.,1033,91,2019-02-03 17:52:09,amrxip

depression,Does 2018 seem like a blur to anyone else?,I woke up today realizing how little of the past year I actually remember. I can remember bits and pieces but otherwise its just a blur.,"Yup. 2018 was the year I was mostly on autopilot. Just living life as life dictates, while I lack the energy or motivation to thrive rather than live.",1033,64,2019-01-01 23:17:48,abn7gx
depression,I socially isolate myself and then wonder why people don't ask to hang out.,"It seems like all of my close friends have moved on and made better friends. A big part of me doesn't blame them - they seem happy and for that I am glad. It's not like they haven't reached out before. They did, and I was guarded and made excuses not to hang out. Nobody knows how to talk to a friend who is deeply depressed. It must be difficult.

A few weeks ago, some of my coworker friends planned a night out for this weekend and invited me. I accepted and was looking forward to it, but a few days ago my one friend told me it had been moved to a later date due to scheduling conflicts. I saw tonight through her Instagram story, several of them ended up going out anyway as a group - it looks like they decided to go without me for whatever reason.

I'm not sure who I am if I'm such a terrible friend.  Not sure how to make it better.",for a second I saw the title and thought that I wrote this and forgot,1028,28,2019-09-07 07:49:30,d0t7yd

depression,"suicide isnt the answer, but people shouldn't call it the coward's way out","I mean someone faced such an awful life filled with hardship, and people are going to call them cowardly? In my opinion, that's seriously low. They don't know what they've been through. How are you going to call someone cowardly if you don't know their story, or have never felt the exact feelings they felt? Everyone processes pain differently. Even though it could be ""no big deal"" for you, it could be pain and anguish for someone else. There is no such thing as a coward, everyone is brave in one way or another.

Sorry for the vent/rant but I seriously hate life... but I'm too stubborn to give up. And I don't want to be called a coward because of the few times I've thought about ending things because they got too hard or stressful. I don't necessarily mean killing myself, but I've thought about giving up getting life together, getting in shape. Because depression is so hard to break out of. But I will always keep trying.",Killing yourself is actually a really hard task and usually requires a lot of courage tbh.,1016,39,2019-06-28 20:46:49,c6phmz
depression,Everything hurts,"My heart hurts, my head hurts, my bones hurt, my arms and my legs hurt, my eyes hurt.

Had a massive panic attack last night with my S.O next to me, not knowing that the fuck to do. I cried, said 'help me' multiple times. I can’t do this to him. He doesn’t deserve it.

Now I feel numb. I don’t care about anything. I don’t even mind going to work this afternoon, I don’t give a fuck about my coworkers, my friends. 

If it wasn’t for my parents and my S.O I would have ended it last night. 

The worst part? I thought I was done being miserable. My last months were happy and bright. I felt good. 

But after last night, I feel like nothing has changed and I‘m in the exact same spot again.
Those panic attacks scare the shit out of me.

depression,I disappointed everyone that expected great things from me,"When I was attending high school, i was top of my class with a dream of attending an ivy league university, particularly MIT. All my teachers were extremely proud of me. My parents were excited for my future in education. My peers thought highly of me. However, once the middle of my junior year came, i was faced with an overwhelming mental breakdown and fell into a depression.

I would spend sleepless nights doing schoolwork with already unstable mental health or i would do completely nothing and think. I eventually started to think about why i am doing this and realized that i dont like this traditional route im going on, nor will the results of it make me happy as i am already depressed doing the things i should like doing.

at that moment, my life lost its meaning. near the end of my junior year into senior, i stopped taking care of myself, developed insomnia (due to my obligation to try and keep up with my AP classes and my thoughts relentlessly wandering), and slept in all my classes. 

my teachers, parents, and peers as a result started looking down at me, wondering why i became such a ""disappointment"" according to my principal when i wanted to lighten my workload. this put me in the deepest depression of my life as i felt i failed everyone and destined to be nothing. 

i would resort to cutting myself, drinking, taking old prescription pills, and withhold from eating as a way to ""punish"" myself. 

to make this short, i decided to make my main way of attaining happiness is music. that is my dream. everyone is still disappointed in me and it weighs heavy on me. i wish it could go away. 

this was more of a medium to vent instead of ask for help as i am not feeling well at the moment. thank you if u actually do read this.",[removed],1005,89,2019-05-07 11:11:45,blpehw
