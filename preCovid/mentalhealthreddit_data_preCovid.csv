mentalhealth,There is an Arabic saying and it goes like this:,"‚ÄúYou want to die? Then throw yourself into the sea and you‚Äôll see yourself fighting to survive. You do not want to kill yourself, rather you want to kill something inside of you‚Äù","I know it's besides the point, but I speak Arabic and am not familiar with the saying, what is it exactly?.
I am just curious.",1488,24,1578921497.0,eo3zu0
mentalhealth,So my therapist messaged me on Grinder ü§™,"So I had researched a new Psychotherapist in the town I was moving to. We spoke on phone and arranged an initial meeting. Last night I arrive to my hotel where I‚Äôll be spending first few nights. I log into Grindr as you do and get a blank profile messaging me soliciting d*ick pics. I proceed to point out the hypocrisy of asking to see my cock when I haven‚Äôt even seen who I am talking to, he then sends me a pic and guess who it is.... Yes, my therapist! Despite sending me a pic that is at least 20 years old I do recognise him. He denies being a therapist and said he was using somebody else‚Äôs face pic blah blah blah. He then blocks me! Today I have a phone call from therapist apologising for those messages and saying it‚Äôs best I look for another therapist! How fucked up is that?! üòÇ",Yikes.,666,46,1580157473.0,eutzn3
mentalhealth,You're not everyone's cup of tea,"The world is filled with people, who no matter what you do, no matter what you try, will simply not like you. But the world is also filled with those who will love you fiercely. The one who love you: They are Your People.

Don't waste your finite time and heart trying to convince the people who aren't your people that you have value. They will miss it completely. They won't buy what you are selling. Don't try to convince them to walk your path with you because you will only waste your time and your emotional good health. Your are not for them and they are not for you. You are not their cup of tea and they are not yours. 

Politely wave them along and you move away as well. Seek to share your path with those who recognize and appreciate your gifts, who you are.

Be who you are. 
You are not everyone's cup of tea and that is OK.",I wish everyone in the world could read this. There are so many people out there that could use this right now.,608,35,1579428367.0,equkm4
mentalhealth,"People who are battling mental ilness on their own because mental health is still taboo in your country or because you don't have the money to afford treatment, raise your hand!‚úã","I want this thread to be about those who literally can't pay for either therapy or medication, have no real place to go and address their issues, or who have been failed by the system & decided to deal with their depression/anxiety ""at home"". 

All of you who find yourselves in this particular position, how do you manage to stay sane? Is it meditation? Prayer? Natural supplements? Physical exercise? Journaling? All of the above? Please share your story.","Mental illness isn't taboo in my country, it's taboo in my family. We never talk about anything. If I were to go back to therapy, my mom would freak, then give me the whole ""I can't deal with this"" speech, because I was severely mentally unstable in my teen years and early 20s, resorted to attempting suicide a few times, was a serious self harmer and was entered into the psych ward more times than I'd like to admit.",567,59,1579514458.0,erbb2h
mentalhealth,watched the joker last night,"such a good film but that diary entry where he wrote ""the worst part of having a mental illness is people expect you to behave as if you don't"" hit me like a tone of bricks like fuck just so unbelievably accurate","The Joker is such a brilliant movie. I remember watching it and relating to it in a very different way due to my anxiety and bipolar depression. 

It's crazy how mental health issues can really alter the way you percieve media and experiences. The Joker makes it so obvious, we are different.",501,33,1579172465.0,ephv4s
mentalhealth,Self Care,"Not only did I get out of bed this morning, but I also went for a run, lifted some weights, showered, shaved, and cleaned my house.  All in a day.  I feel great :)

Edit:. Wow, you guys are amazing!  Thank you for all of the support.  I specifically felt like sharing because when I woke up, I ALMOST let myself waste away in bed all day, but I just knew I'd already had too many of those days.  Hopefully anyone else who struggles can find that hope and that drive :) self care makes an enormous difference in mental and physical health.",I try to at least shower no matter how miserable I feel it does make a difference,453,23,1578755243.0,en8h3z
mentalhealth,Does anyone else just want to sleep to escape reality,"My first post on Reddit. (39M)

I have always been of strong character and hard working, people who know me would say I'm life and soul, funny, intelligent and strong. Recently though I've found myself slipping into a routine of staying up late and sleeping all day and being lazy. I cocoon myself in my duvet and wrap a pillow around my head and try to sleep as long as possible. I can wake momentarily and remember my dreams quite vividly (they are always enjoyable happy dreams) I can then just remember the dream and slip back into them. 

It's like I'm addicted to my dreams and as soon as I wake I try and try to enter back into that world. Sometimes I'm successful but after 12 hours sadly I am in the real world. 

I am in danger of losing my job because of this now which worries me even more. It's quite apparent that I must be depressed. I have so much to be grateful for but it appears the big D has taken over my life. Can I regain my normal life? This is the first time I've ever spoke about it to anyone, probably the wrong place to seek help, I have no idea. I need to sort my sh*t out before I lose my job and subsequently my house then I shall be at rock bottom.",I relate so much to this.,452,34,1578412290.0,eld9uc
mentalhealth,You made it.,"You did it. You got through another year. Despite the hardships, despite how badly you may have wanted to give up, you did it. Against all odds you are here. Something within you made you keep going. You are brave, you are strong.
I‚Äôm proud of you.","Thankyou so much for this, exactly what I needed to hear! And of course, all of that applies to you too, so well done :)",438,22,1578068707.0,ejhopu
mentalhealth,Treating someone terribly and telling them to go to therapy is kinda like punching someone in the face and telling them to see a doctor,,"I kinda agree. My husband had cheated so many times and when I got depressed and suicidal he just told me he'd have me committed and he'd get custody of our son cuz I'm documented mentally ill. He cheats and I feel worthless and want to die but ""it's my mental health"" that's make me feel like this, was never his unfaithfulness",435,16,1577929321.0,eirahg
